Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) provide unchallenged specificity compared to small molecules, representing a
growing market of 150+ billion dollars. Due to their structural complexity and poor stability, however, they remain
difficult to formulate at high concentrations, making intravenous (IV) delivery of mAbs the “gold standard”. IV
injections present major drawbacks, such as patient discomfort, long injection times, and high medical costs
associated with in-hospital administration. Subcutaneous (SC) delivery is a convenient route of administration
for large molecules, as it allows for rapid injections (seconds), requires minimal skills (self-injection), and allows
for systemic delivery. It remains an open challenge to reformulate mAbs to a SC form. Most mAbs requires large
dosage to be effective (>300 mg), and SC administration volumes are constrained to only 1-2 ml, hundreds of
times smaller than typical IV formulations
SC injections using hydrogel microparticles (HMP) offer a promising method for encapsulating and delivering
protein-based drugs. The composition, size, and mechanical properties of HMPs can be widely tuned to facilitate
their injection through needles for subcutaneous delivery. Alginate-based MP are becoming increasingly popular
due to their rheological properties and high biocompatibility. Additionally, the anionic nature of alginate enables
electrostatic entrapment of cationic proteins independently of the hydrogel porosity, making it a candidate for
hydrogel-based antibody formulations. However, current manufacturing technologies are limited to low
concentration of polymer (<5%), and low cargo loading, typically below 30 mg/ml for antibodies, resulting in
inadequate mechanical and therapeutic properties.
Through the support of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project, we aim at improving
clinical care of millions of patients by reformulating IV-delivered mAbs to a SC form, meaning patients could
administer their life saving drugs with reduced pain and discomfort, at a fraction of the cost.
We plan to leverage Acoustophoretic Printing (AP) to generate alginate MP to stabilize highly concentrated mAbs
formulation. This platform technology enables microparticle generation under modest shear forces without the
need for a hydrophobic carrier fluid, thereby protecting the valuable cargo and minimizing contamination. The
technology features: high bio-compatibility with no oil or surfactant required, making this technology particularly
suitable for large proteins; high concentrations of cargo (>100mg/ml), including alginate (>10%); low particle size
variation (coefficient of variation of 1-3%) reducing costly sieving steps, consistency in cargo encapsulation and
delivery - hence significantly improving Good Manufacturing Practices - even at extreme loading.
This project aims to: (1) Manufacture mAbs loaded hydrogel-based microparticles for SC delivery and
characterize them in-vitro, including encapsulation efficiency, release profile, and injectability. (2) Conduct In vivo
study to investigate safety, bioavailability, and bioactivity of the MP-based formulations in murine models.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Modern drug analysis techniques are an integral part of research and healthcare today. Regrettably,
the current approach for sample collection consists of literally removing “a piece of the patient or experimental
animal” (whether it is a blood sample or a tissue biopsy) that is sent to the laboratory for analysis. Such a
procedure poses ethical issues, health risks for the medical personnel, and inconvenience for the investigated
being (patient or lab animal). Furthermore, although it has been recognized that tissue concentrations are
more predictive of clinical outcome than plasma concentrations, the assessment of drug distribution and
target site pharmacokinetics is very difficult because of lack of appropriate methodology. Point-of-care
devices for measuring electrolytes, cardiac markers, and several small molecules now reside in emergency
rooms and even at patient bedsides - but there are no clinical devices for fast monitoring of drug levels in
body fluids and tissues. The need for such devices is even greater for difficult to treat diseases such as
neoplasms.
 In response to the current challenges faced by drug analysis for pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics,
and therapeutic drug monitoring, we are proposing to apply innovative microsampling approaches to measure
therapeutic antibody concentrations in the tumors without collecting a physical sample from the investigated
organism. These methods feature reliable calibration, freedom from pumps, no osmotic effects, and
significant improvements in sensitivity. Furthermore, they are faster and more economical than classical
ones.
 The new methods will be applied for the first time to measure the tumor concentration of immune
checkpoint inhibitors that act by blocking the programmed cell death receptors on T cells.
 The proposed research will utilize biocompatible sampling devices for direct microextraction of
antibody drugs from tumors. These devices will be prepared by covering flexible medical-grade metal wires
with biocompatible polymers and high affinity extractive phases. The extracted analytes will be quantified
by chromatography and mass spectrometry to offer high specificity and low limits of detection.
 For quantitation, several calibration methods will be applied, such as external standard, diffusion-based
calibration, and kinetic calibration. The data will be used to build a pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model
for a representative therapeutic antibody, such as pembrolizumab.
 The new in vivo sampling method will be validated by comparison with large pore microdialysis. It is
expected that microextraction will provide better sensitivity, accuracy, less tissue damage (due to smaller size),
portability, and convenience (no pumps and fluids).

Sleep is a basic biological need and sufficient sleep is required for physical and mental health. Reduced or
disordered sleep contributes to an array of metabolic, inflammatory, cardiovascular, and neurological
disorders, reduces productivity and performance, and is a threat to public safety. Understanding the control
of sleep is therefore critical for human health and society. Sleep pressure (or sleepiness) has long been
thought to be driven by substances that accumulate in the brain, where they promote sleep by acting on
neural centers of sleep control. The identification of molecular mediators of sleep pressure in the brain would
be highly significant, in that it would provide obvious targets for the improvement of daily sleep. Here we
propose a large and unbiased screen for molecules that the fit the criteria for sleep promoting substances
that drive daily changes in sleep pressure and promote homeostatic increases in sleep following sleep
deprivation. To this end we have developed methods to differentiate molecules that rise with increasing
sleep pressure from those that rise in direct response to the mechanical perturbation necessary to keep
animal subjects awake. In doing so we have addressed a fundamental challenge to the identification of
molecular correlates of sleep pressure. Using Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization – Time of Flight
Mass Spectrometry, we will identify molecules whose abundance tracks sleep pressure within the central
brain, where sleep is controlled. The identification of candidate sleep substances will set the stage for new
mechanistic investigations of sleep in Drosophila whose aim is to identify conserved molecular mechanisms
of its homeostatic control. Given the existence of sleep-like states across the animal kingdom and the
presence of homeostatic sleep control even in animals with extremely simple nervous systems, discoveries
made in Drosophila are likely to reveal conserved features physiological systems regulating sleep.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Knowing the structure, dynamics and ligand binding specificity of proteins and nucleic acids is essential to
understanding the mechanisms of human disease and to the optimal design of molecules that can intervene
therapeutically in disease processes. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy is one of the most
versatile techniques for obtaining this molecular information. This tremendous value of NMR in biomedical
science is only realized through the application of powerful computational tools. Our goal in this project is to
continue the development of, and add powerful new features to, an integrated software application for the
computational analysis of NMR data. Having this effective software, NMRFx, for NMR is especially critical as
we realize that deep insight into macromolecular structure and function comes not from a single technique like
NMR, but from the complementary information from various techniques including NMR, X-ray crystallography,
and Cryo-electron microscopy. Scientists are no longer seeing these techniques as specialized techniques
usable by only domain experts, but as a collection of techniques that can and should be applied together.
Without this NMRFx software, researchers must otherwise use a variety of tools from different labs that have
different programming languages, scripting tools, naming conventions, graphical interfaces, documentation
styles etc. The NMRFx software that is the subject of this project integrates signal processing, data analysis,
visualization and macromolecular structure calculations based on NMR data. In the current project this
software will be enhanced with the addition of an integrated deep learning library that will allow new types of
data analyses using these new tools that are making major advances in scientific research. The performance
of the software will be dramatically enhanced by the addition of a software library that allows computations to
be dispatched to high-performance hardware like GPUs (graphical processing units) and FPGAs (Field
Programmable Gate Arrays). This performance enhancement will allow much faster computations and allow
use of algorithms that were previously too slow to use in interactive analyses. We will also complete the
implementation of the remaining features necessary for the full analysis of NMR data. We propose that by
providing new and experienced users with an enhanced version of our software application that has a common
installation protocol, interface style, data structures, and overall design, we can substantially lower barriers to
the use of NMR. NMRFx is making the use of NMR techniques more accessible to a wider population of
researchers. The software, including the addition of the deep learning and acceleration libraries, will increase
the contributions of NMR in a broad range of biological research areas that impact on human health.

 Human oral polymicrobial communities play a significant role in health and disease. Periodontitis is a
polymicrobial disease and is among the most common infections of humans. Recent next-generation sequencing
studies reveal that periodontal polymicrobial communities are comprised of a large diversity of bacterial species;
however, we have little to no understanding of the disease-role of some of the key members. Saccharibacteria
(TM7) is one such bacterial group that has been linked to multiple inflammatory diseases, including periodontitis.
In addition, TM7 belongs to a major bacterial lineage termed Candidate Phyla Radiation. Candidate Phyla
Radiation encompasses one-quarter of all bacterial diversity, yet they have been recalcitrant to laboratory
cultivation. Oral TM7 bacteria were the first to be cultivated, opening the door to many intriguing questions due
to their unique characteristics. TM7 has an ultra-small cell size (200-500 nm) with a highly reduced genome
lacking essential biological functions. More importantly, it is an epiparasitic bacteria that grows on the surface of
Actinobacteria (i.e., Actinomyces, Pseudopropionibacterium), which is another understudied bacterial group in
humans. Actinomyces has been shown to induce inflammatory response both in cultured cells and in animal
models. Our preliminary mouse periodontal studies were designed to investigate the role of TM7 and its host
bacteria, Actinomyces, in vivo. TM7/host bacteria pairs induced less inflammatory bone loss compared to host
bacteria alone, suggesting that oral Actinomyces and related bacteria can be a pathobiont (opportunistic
pathogen), and their pathogenicity is regulated by TM7 bacteria. The current proposal will investigate pathogenic
genes in TM7 host bacteria and how they are regulated by TM7 bacteria via metatranscriptomics. Identified
genes will be further tested by site-directed mutagenesis in the host bacteria (Aim 1). The proposal will also
determine the pathogenic and immunostimulatory activity of TM7 bacteria in epithelial and immune cell
interaction assay and will identify TM7 macromolecules that are involved in their interaction with the eukaryotic
cells (Aim 2). Lastly, this study will expand to culturing and characterizing additional taxonomically diverse TM7
bacteria from the periodontal patients, effectively creating a library of TM7 bacteria. This will allow us to determine
the general immunological behavior of TM7/host bacteria across different TM7 species (Aim 3). Accomplishment
of the proposal aims will improve the currently limited understanding of TM7 bacteria and its interaction with the
host bacteria, as well as generate the first understanding of TM7's role in periodontal and inflammatory diseases.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Host mucosal surfaces are highly specialized and possess a complex array of innate and adaptive immunity.
They provide the first line of protection against infectious agents by initiating protective responses to potential
pathogens. Furthermore, the symbiotic relationship of the hundreds of microbial species with the host requires
a fine-tuned response at the mucosal surface that prevents overgrowth of opportunistic pathogens, but sparing
beneficial microbes. While small RNAs (sRNAs) have been regarded as a class of intracellular regulatory
elements, emerging studies in plant-pathogen and host-gut microbiome interactions uncover that hosts can
exploit sRNAs, such as transfer RNA (tRNA)-derived sRNAs (termed “tsRNAs”), via encapsulation in
exosomes, as a new mode of bacterial gene modulation or defense mechanism. Yet, it remains to be
elucidated whether such sRNA-mediated inter-kingdom gene modulation or defense mechanism exist in the
context of host-oral microbiome interaction. To address this knowledge gap, the present R01 application will
focus on host-derived, exosome-borne, salivary tsRNAs, of which the biological functions have remained
largely elusive to date. Speficically, we recently demonstrated that human Normal Oral Keratinocyte-
Spontaneously Immortalized (NOKSI) cells released two exosome-borne tsRNAs, tsRNA-000794 and tsRNA-
020498, when challenged with Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn), a key oral commensal and opportunistic
periodontal pathogen. Importantly, these two tsRNAs can be readily detected from saliva in healthy human
subjects. Intriguingly, both tsRNAs exhibit highly selective, Fn-targeting antimicrobial activity—directly adding
synthetic mimics of these two tsRNAs, but not scramble RNA, to bacterial culture inhibits the growth of Fn, but
not that of Porphyromonas ginigivalis (Pg), a gram-negative periodontal pathogen or Streptococcus mitis (Sm),
a health-associated oral bacterium. In preliminary work, we further took a multi-facet approach to identify a
putative RNA-specific membrane transporter as well as candidate intracellular bacterial protein targets of Fn-
targeting tsRNAs. Building on our comprehensive preliminary data, the goal of this application is two-fold: (Part
I) achieve mechanistic understanding of the cross-kingdom trafficking of host-derived Fn-targeting tsRNAs and
their modulating effect on Fn growth during NOKSI-Fn interaction, through exosome tracking and in-depth
dissection of the tsRNAs transporter and intracellular targets in Fn; (Part II) expand our work to profile and
compare salivary tsRNAs between healthy and periodontitis subjects, with a focus on demonstrating the broad
implication of host-generated tsRNAs as a conserved mechanism to achieve host-microbial homeostasis. The
realization of this application will not only address a fundamental question by defining tsRNAs as a new class
of host defense molecules in maintaining host-microbiome homeostasis via targeted microbial modulation, but
also will pave the way for a new therapeutic strategy against oral diseases, considering the already successful
trajectory of nucleic acid therapeutics in recent years.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Sjögren's syndrome (SS) is a chronic autoimmune disease affecting millions of Americans, in which
salivary glands are the primary target of autoreactive T cells, leading to hyposalivation, the major
disease hallmark. Hyposalivation (dry mouth) causes a variety of oral health issues and severely
compromises quality of life. SS has no cure and current treatments are predominantly palliative. Failure
of therapies for SS are inextricably linked to the inability to control autoinflammation; thus, we propose
to investigate both simultaneously. To achieve sustainable salivary secretion, development of
approaches to simultaneously enhance endogenous salivary gland regeneration and protect the glands
from further injury from autoimmune inflammation are critically needed. Our preliminary studies
strongly suggest that there are protective actions provided by intermittent fasting (IF) in SS. In non-
obese diabetic (NOD) mice, a well-defined spontaneous model of SS, IF enhances the proliferation of
salivary gland stem cells, and upregulates Wnt and Notch signaling and Peroxisome Proliferator-
Activated Receptor-driven fatty acid oxidation, which are critically involved in the expansion and
differentiation of multiple stem cell types. It also mitigates autoreactive T helper 1, T helper 17 and
cytotoxic T cell responses in the salivary gland-draining lymph nodes. The objective of this proposed
project is to determine the previously unexplored impact of IF on the activity of endogenous salivary
gland stem/progenitor cells and autoimmune inflammation in SS to unravel the underlying molecular
and cellular mechanisms of IF benefits, with the long-term goal of developing effective and targeted
therapies to fundamentally improve salivary gland function. Based on the literature and our preliminary
results, we formulated the central hypothesis that IF exerts beneficial actions on salivary gland
restoration through promoting endogenous salivary gland regeneration and diminishing T cell mediated
autoimmune inflammation in SS. This hypothesis will be tested through the following specific aims: In
Aim 1, we will dissect the potential molecular mechanisms for the impact of IF on the proliferation and
differentiation of salivary gland stem cells in the NOD mouse, a spontaneous model of SS; In Aim 2,
we will assess the impact of IF on the self-expansion and cellular plasticity of ductal salivary gland
progenitor cells and acinar cells, the function and plasticity of T cell subsets, and the attenuation of
autoimmune inflammation in the salivary tissues, using lineage tracing mouse models and an inducible
model of SS. Successful completion of this study will provide new targets for the development of
effective new therapeutics for SS-like exocrinopathy, as well as provide insight into the treatment of
xerostomia caused by radiation, medications or aging, and other autoimmune diseases that share
similarities in their pathogenesis with SS.

This application proposes to lay the groundwork for precision medicine approaches to autism spectrum disorder
(ASD) by identifying reproducible clinically relevant brain-connectome-based subtypes. The proposal addresses
the clinical and biological heterogeneity of ASD by focusing on the intermediate level of analysis of systems
neuroscience, following clues that ASD is associated with abnormalities in the brain functional connectome.
Thus, we aim to identify neurosubtypes (NS), i.e., subgroups of individuals with homogeneous atypical features,
based on measures of intrinsic functional connectivity (iFC). Primary aims are to: 1) generate a large,
retrospectively harmonized data resource with comprehensive assessment of iFC and clinical phenotypes; 2)
identify iFC-based neurosubtypes and establish their associations with clinically relevant phenotypes; 3) test the
replicability of neurosubtypes and their associations with phenotypic measures in an independent sample . To
this end, we propose to leverage existing large-scale ASD neuroimaging data collections from the Autism Brain
Imaging Data Exchange, the National Database for Autism Research, and the Healthy Brain Network. Sample:
Age/Sex: Boys and girls, 6-18 years old. Diagnosis: ASD and neurotypical (NT) individuals. Size: to date, the
above neuroimaging resources contain a total N=3528; ASD n=2136, NT n=1392. Methods: Following
systematic and extensive data organization, rigorous quality assurance, and preprocessing we will proceed with
quantitative data harmonization using state-of-the-art methods. CovBat, the most advanced version of the
Bayesian framework, ComBat, will be applied to harmonize MRI data. It has been developed by Co-I Shinohara
to control for inter-scanner differences in MRI-based measures, as well as for errors arising from subject
differences in measurement covariance. Recent advances in item response theory will be used to harmonize
phenotypic data, informed by preliminary clinical work. To further enhance our clinical data harmonization efforts,
the neuroimaging data will be aggregated with phenotypic-only collections from Co-Is Lord and Bishop (ASD
n=1513). Connectopathy features: To scope the entire spectrum of ASD connectopathy, multiple features will be
assessed simultaneously for the first time. Neurosubtypes: Building on our feasibility work with Co-I Yeo,
homogeneous neural ASD subgroups will be identified through novel Bayesian latent factor modeling. It allows
for subjects to belong to subtypes in varying degrees, identifying hybrid, categorical and dimensional,
neurosubtypes. Other key questions include the relevance of MRI features studied, the diagnostic specificity of
neurosubtypes, and cross-subtyping method validity. The neurosubtypes identified and methods for
harmonization, along with all data generated for mega-analyses will be regularly shared, starting at the end of
year two. Findings will address critical knowledge gaps and the novel resource will offer the scientific community
opportunities to pursue independent inquiries transforming biological research and knowledge of ASD.

Salivary gland function is chronically impaired in Sjӧgren’s syndrome, an autoimmune exocrine gland disease
with no cure or effective treatment available. Aberrantly activated innate immune cells, autoreactive T- and B
cells, and proinflammatory cytokines collectively cause Sjogren’s-characteristic salivary gland inflammation and
dysfunction. There is an urgent need for novel, effective therapies that protect/improve salivary gland function
and ameliorate salivary gland inflammation. The importance of host gut microbiome in health and disease is
increasingly recognized, yet very little is known about the impact of gut microbiome on salivary glands, especially
the protective bacteria and their actions. Hence, the main objective of this project is to address this knowledge
gap, with a particular focus on identifying the potentially salivary gland-protective gut bacteria and revealing their
precise actions using both murine models and cells and samples from Sjӧgren’s disease patients. Our
preliminary studies showed that transplant of fecal bacteria from healthy C57BL/6 mice to the non-obese diabetic
mice, a spontaneous model of Sjӧgren’s syndrome, exerted a protective effect on salivary glands. The protection
was accompanied by reduced inflammatory responses and diminished expression of bromodomain containing
2, an epigenetic reader/modulator, in salivary gland epithelial cells. We also identified multiple specific bacterial
species with salivary gland-protective potentials based on our preliminary microbiome analyses and the pertinent
evidence from human studies in the literature. We formed the central hypothesis that healthy gut microbiota
contains bacterial species that, acting through their metabolites, protect salivary gland function by mitigating
inflammatory responses and dysfunction of salivary gland epithelial cells through mechanisms including
downregulating the expression of epigenetic reader of bromodomain containing 2. Aim 1 of this project will
define and discover the mechanisms underlying the protective effects of healthy C57BL/6 fecal microbiota
transplant on salivary glands in the non-obese diabetic mice and a second, induced model of Sjӧgren’s
syndrome. Aim 2 will explore the protective impact of specific gut bacterial species on salivary gland function
in the two mouse models. Aim 3 will identify and test microbial metabolites that may mediate the salivary gland-
protective impact of gut microbiota using both mouse SS models and cells/samples from human Sjӧgren’s
disease patients. The project will employ a combination of sophisticated immunological, microbiological and
systemic biological methodologies, including 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis of microbiome, RNA-
sequencing analysis of host cells, and metabolomic assays. Knowledge generated will have direct relevance to
and impact on human health, and will advance the development of novel, gut microbe/microbial metabolite-
based therapies to combat autoimmune Sjӧgren’s disease as well as other salivary gland inflammatory disorders.

The goal of this fast-track SBIR proposal is to increase patient adherence to SBIRT-related recommendations
given to patients by a primary care provider (PCP). The success of SBIRT (Screening, Brief Intervention, and
Referral to Treatment) in the primary care setting has been inconsistent in terms of patients following through
on treatment referral recommendations, with averages as low as 10%. For a variety of reasons, many patients,
irrespective of their specific disease, do not adhere well to clinical recommendations. One way to improve
adherence has been to personalize the recommendations for each individual’s needs, especially using digital
technology, such as apps. The aim of NIDA to develop a sophisticated smart phone based tool for improving
patient follow up to SBIRT recommendations is therefore well justified.
CHESS Health has already developed an automated digital tool (eIntervention) with key elements requested
by this RFA. eIntervention is designed to encourage patient adherence to PCP recommendations following
SBIRT. Using a variety of the RFA required functionalities, eIntervention is designed to facilitate and motivate
each patient to enter treatment, once that patient has been identified by SBIRT as having a substance use
disorder (SUD) or as being at risk of such. eIntervention is commercially available and was developed in
response to customer requests. However, eIntervention does not contain all of the functionalities requested by
NIDA in this RFA and we do not have data to validate efficacy. Such validation is important for supporting wide
spread dissemination. We propose to enhance our existing eIntervention solution with new functionalities that
address the requirements set forth in this RFA and carry out a randomized study of efficacy.
In Phase I, our Specific Aim is to evaluate feasibility of our program for improving adherence to SBIRT
recommendations to patients from PCPs. This Specific Aim will be accomplished in two Tasks:
Task 1: Add functionality to our prototype that address most requirements outlined in the RFA.
Task 2: Demonstrate acceptability, feasibility, and preliminary efficacy of the prototype eIntervention in
improving patient linkage to and engagement in indicated follow-up specialty SUD care.
If shown to be feasible, in Phase II, our Specific Aim is to evaluate a near commercial quality product that
contains all of the features required by the RFA. The Specific Aim will be accomplished in two Tasks:
Task 1: Modifications to the program (months 1-3).
Task 2: The randomized clinical trial to test efficacy of SBIRT/eIntervention compared to SBIRT/TAU.
Criteria for Success: We aim to double the current rate of follow-up specialty SUD care (e.g. go from ~17% to
an achieved rate of ~35%), a highly impactful effect. All patients, including those identified as at risk, must
show a reduction in substance use. Patients and PCPs must rank the program with an average of 3.5 on a
five-point Likert scale for usability, satisfaction, and willingness to use with the program again.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Periodontitis is initiated by oral bacteria, but quickly transits to an inflammatory immune disease with loss of host-
bacterial homeostasis. Homeostasis, the symbiotic balance between host tissues and the resident periodontal
microbiome is disrupted by a dysregulated immune response. From symbiosis to dysbiosis, early innate immune
components are robustly linked. At the host-microbial interface, we have ample evidence that microbes trigger
the immune response but lack knowledge of how the immune response regulates the composition and functional
activity of the microbiome. Specialized Pro-resolving Mediators (SPMs) are a family of eicosanoid lipid mediators
that bind to specific cell receptors to coordinate the return of an inflammatory lesion to homeostasis. Among the
many SPMs, E-series resolvins are naturally occurring metabolites of transformation circuits of the omega-3 fatty
acid, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), that actively induce resolution of inflammation. Activation of the Resolvin E1
(RvE1) receptor (ERV1) in gain-of-function studies with the ERV1 transgenic mouse (ERV1tg), show profound
resistance to periodontitis. The use of resolvins to control inflammation allows us to test our central hypothesis
that early immune activation directly contributes to the development of periodontal dysbiosis, which can be re-
versed/prevented by activating Resolivin-E1 mediated resolution of inflammation pathways. To test this hypoth-
esis, we break our investigations into two levels. First, in a murine model, we will characterize the oral microbi-
ome’s functional and spatial organizational changes as symbiosis transits to dysbiosis. Second, we will use an
in vitro system to unravel the mechanisms that determine how RvE1 and its receptor (ERV1) influence the dy-
namics of dysbiosis and inflammatory/immune responses in periodontitis. The candidate is a DDS/PhD perio-
dontist who is committed to an academic career dedicated to improving periodontal and oral health. The men-
tored phase of the proposal will be carried out with Dr. Thomas Van Dyke (Primary mentor) and Dr. Xuesong He
(Co-mentor) at the Forsyth Institute. The goal of the K99 phase is to provide additional training, mentoring, and
experience in three important areas 1) advanced bioinformatics training for microbiome data; 2) study design
and biostatistics training; and 3) career development. A strong Scientific Advisory Committee from the Forsyth
Institute, Harvard Medical School, and the University of Washington has been established with diverse expertise
in immunology, microbiology, bioinformatics, and statistics to help guide the candidate providing a training plan
that complements and expands her scientific background with mentors whose expertise spans the broad scope
of the scientific problem. The scientific component and training outlined in this proposal provide a pathway for
the candidate to transit to an independent research career in a tenure track faculty position independent of the
research programs of the mentors. Successful completion of this project will lead to better understanding of
host-microbiome interactions and how to gain control of the inflammation/dysbiosis cycle in periodontitis to ame-
liorate disease.

The work proposed in this application is a supplement to the work Charles River Analytics is already
conducting under our NIDA-funded SBIR (through a fast-track application) entitled Novel, On-demand VR for
Accessible, Practical, and Engaging therapy (NO VAPE) (Grant # 1R44DA059018-01). Aim 2 of NO VAPE is
to Solicit Feedback from Payors and FDA. To support positive coverage decisions by payors and meet FDA
standards for medical device clearance, we will conduct at least five interviews with payors (Milestone 2a) and
hold one FDA presubmission meeting (Milestone 2b) to finalize the design of the human factors evaluations
and the Phase II clinical trial.
If we are not accepted, we will contact payors on our own and conduct at least five interviews with companies
such as Aetna, BlueCross/BlueShield, Cigna, Clover Health, Kaiser Permanente, and United Health Group (all
of whom participate in the early payor feedback program). If we are accepted into I-Corps, we will use the
resources to increase this goal and will conduct 100 total discovery interviews with potential customers,
strategic partners, and other third-party stakeholders.
While NO VAPE focuses on providing an immersive and engaging platform for individuals to practice cognitive
behavioral therapy (CBT) skills to quit vaping, Charles River’s long-term strategic goal is to become the
preeminent supplier of metaverse tools for treatment of substance dependence (e.g., nicotine, alcohol,
stimulants) and mental health issues (e.g., PTSD, OCD). Participation in the I-Corps Program will provide us
with multiple opportunities to improve our approach to the commercialization of our NO VAPE platform, as well
as our other metaverse tools.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Development of radiation medical countermeasures (MCM) has become a national security priority owing to
such threats as radiological dispersal devices (i.e., “dirty bomb”) and nuclear accidents, which may be caused
by extreme weather (such as occurred in Fukushima, Japan in 2011). Radiation exposure can be potentially
lethal via the hematopoietic-acute radiation syndrome (H-ARS) and the gastrointestinal-ARS (GI-ARS). The
U.S. government has committed to supporting development of medical countermeasures (MCMs) to mitigate
morbidity and mortality of these radiation syndromes. Re-purposed leukemia drugs have proven useful in
treatment of the H-ARS in preclinical models, but there remains no effective MCM for GI-ARS.
Ceramedix, Inc. is developing a pipeline of therapeutic candidates with the goal of preventing and
mitigating illness due to radiation exposure. Our lead candidate, CX-01, is an anti-ceramide single-chain
variable antibody fragment (scFv) that binds ceramide on the exocellular leaflet of the plasma membrane of
radiation-injured endothelial cells in the GI tract and in other organs. By binding ceramide, ceramide-rich
platforms are disrupted, thereby preventing cellular death. Extensive data in multiple species, including non-
human primates (NHPs), show that disrupting the ceramide signaling pathway protects and mitigates the GI-
ARS. We have demonstrated dose-dependent efficacy in NHPs as well as mortality benefits in mice. CX-01
may be administered subcutaneously, a critical advantage during mass casualty events.
Ceramedix’ therapeutics may have broad application in multiple additional diseases. Ceramide-rich
platform signaling is a ubiquitous damage response pathway that drives cell injury and death in response to
diverse disease and environmental stimuli. Ceramedix has generated significant preclinical data supporting
treatment of diabetic retinopathy and diabetic macular edema. Ceramedix is also exploring other diseases
including diabetic nephropathy and pulmonary injury (fibrosis and other pulmonary syndromes).
The overall goal of this work is to validate that CX-01 demonstrates equivalent potency and efficacy as a
precursor non-humanized scFv molecule. We will perform in vitro and in vivo pharmacological studies to
support CX-01 IND acceptance.
The ability to prevent and treat GI-ARS would have profound benefits in protecting civilians and defense
personnel. There is no current treatment for GI-ARS, particularly one suitable for field administration following
a mass casualty event. USG has prioritized this critical unmet medical need.
CX-01 represents a major breakthrough in potential treatment of the lethal GI-ARS. CX-01 has the
potential to become the first and only available treatment for GI-ARS. Successful completion of this work will
accelerate IND submission and clinical evaluation of Ceramedix’ transformative therapeutic platform.

There is a consensus that chronic pain is a widespread major health problem and that development of better
drugs is needed to address this unmet need and combat the opioid abuse crisis. The pain crisis is particularly
burdensome for patients with severe pain, many of whom are on opioids, and have failed all other measures.
These patients may be candidates for a simple, but elegant alternative, namely intrathecal (IT) drug delivery
using an FDA approved fully implantable pump. The dose level with IT delivery is orders of magnitude less
than what is required for systemic delivery which greatly improves the safety margin. The FDA has approved
only two pain drugs for these micro-infusion devices, morphine and ziconotide. Though helpful in many
patients, side effects, safety issues, and inadequate efficacy limit their use. CNTX-3001 is a novel, non-opioid,
highly potent (picomolar Ki and EC50), highly selective small molecule agonist of the nociceptin receptor
(NOPr). Preclinical data in multiple species, including non-human primates, indicate that NOPr agonists are
powerful analgesics when delivered directly to the spinal cord by IT administration. The goal of this proposal is
to develop CNTX-3001 by conducting IND-enabling studies and a first-in-human Phase 1 trial. To be effective,
NOPr agonists must be applied directly to the region of the spinal cord because activation of brain NOPr
receptors may enhance pain. By contrast, IT NOPr agonists show no behavioral side effects at therapeutic
dose levels in preclinical studies (including non-human primates). CNTX-3001 possesses favorable
physiochemical properties for IT delivery, including an ideal balance of water solubility (for delivery to CSF) and
lipid solubility (for local distribution into the spinal cord). When delivered via bolus to the lumbar spinal cord of
rats, CNTX-3001 is powerfully analgesic with efficacy and behavioral side effect profiles superior to the gold-
standard FDA-approved option, IT morphine. The goal will be to develop CNTX-3001 for chronic IT delivery
using an approved pump. This grant will allow us to scale up production of drug substance (DS), undertake
formulation development, and run stability studies to ensure a stable drug product (DP) for IT delivery. We will
produce GMP-grade DS and DP and run non-GLP and GLP toxicity studies in two preclinical species. Data
from these studies will lead to a Phase 1 study evaluating tolerability and efficacy in patients with intractable
chronic low back pain (IT delivery is not appropriate for healthy volunteers). Results from this grant will lay the
groundwork for further clinical development (Phase 2 and 3 trials) using implantable pumps for continuous
delivery of CNTX-3001. We believe that Centrexion's IT drug candidate, CNTX-3001, has the capacity to
revolutionize management of severe pain in patients with few or no other options.

Critical self-judgment is a common phenomenon underlying a wide range of psychological disorders. The
proposed project aims to investigate the neural mechanism of critical self-judgment by analyzing fMRI and
questionnaire data from a total of 203 subjects collected from 5 previous projects that all included mindfulness
or compassion-based interventions for various conditions, e.g., depression, anxiety, trauma, stress and chronic
pain. The analyses will particularly evaluate the effective and functional connectivity among the amygdala, the
hippocampus, inferior frontal gyrus and precuneus, to test the central hypothesis that critical self-judgment is
characterized by excessive influence from negative valence on the left Inferior Frontal Gyrus-Pars Triangularis
(IFGPT), a key area for internal speech and self-awareness, which further influences the precuneus (PCu) of
the default mode network (DMN), a neural circuitry that supports self-referential processes.
Aim 1: To elucidate the effective connectivity in the neural circuitry during critical self-judgment. Using
fMRI data from a self-reappraisal task that included self-critical vs. self-reassurance conditions, Granger
Causality analysis will be conducted with fMRI time series from regions of interest of the hypothesized neural
circuitry to test whether there is significant effective connectivity in the directions of amygdala→IFGPT and
IFGPT→PCu during self-critical condition. Similar analyses with the self-reassurance condition will test whether
there is significant effective connectivity in the direction of MPFC→amygdala and IFGPT→amygdala, reflecting
frontal inhibition of negative affect.
Aim 2: To identify features from resting state fMRI that are associated with trait critical self-judgment.
Through analyzing resting state fMRI data with the CONN toolbox, we will extract Resting State Functional
Connectivity (RSFC) from regions of interest in the proposed neural circuitry, then use linear mixed effects
models to test whether the severity of trait critical self-judgment is collectively predicted by RSFC of
hippocampus-IFGPT, amygdala-IFGPT, IFGPT-PCu, hippocampus-PCu and amygdala-PCu.
Aim 3: To investigate whether post-intervention changes in trait critical self-judgment are predicted by
changes in the proposed neural circuitry. By analyzing post-intervention changes in fMRI metrics and trait
critical self-judgment severity, we will test whether post-intervention changes in trait critical self-judgment are
predicted by post-intervention changes in RSFC of hippocampal-IFGPT, amygdala-IFGPT, IFGPT-PCu,
hippocampus-PCu and amygdala-PCu.

 Despite much progress in mapping genetic associations for T2D, its complications, and related traits,
the underlying causal variants, effector genes, and gene networks are not well understood. The AMP-T2D
consortium aims to accelerate the pace by which these disease mechanisms are elucidated, through
generation and integration of novel genomic data interrogating genetic associations. This project addresses
RFA-DK-19-505 “Limited Competition for the Accelerating Medicines Partnership (AMP) in Type 2 Diabetes
Knowledge Portal (UM1)” and will be conducted by the leaders of the current AMP T2D Knowledge Portal
(T2DKP). Its goal is to continue development of the T2DKP by enhancing its infrastructure to aggregate,
analyze, and visualize genetic and genomic datasets and results, thereby helping to identify causal risk
variants and effector genes for T2D and its complications.
 The goal of specific aim 1 is to enhance the data and knowledge base for the T2DKP. It will enhance
the T2DKP software platform to represent additional classes of ‘omic and phenotypic data, integrate datasets
relevant to AMP-T2D within a federated data warehouse, develop new methods and analytical pipelines to
analyze these data, and enable them to be accessed by download or application programming interfaces
(APIs). The goal of specific aim 2 is to enhance the publicly accessible T2DKP web interface. It will develop
new web modules to visualize datasets within the T2DKP, extend the T2DKP with tools from external public
genomic databases, maintain curated knowledge lists for T2D and its complications, allow users to customize
data and tools shown within the T2DKP, and update the T2DKP in response to stakeholder feedback. The goal
of specific aim 3 is to coordinate the AMP-T2D consortium. It will provide operational support for AMP-T2D
investigators, foster collaborations with external partners, track and ensure the timely release of AMP-T2D
datasets, administer an opportunity pool to fund additional AMP-T2D projects, and conduct outreach and
training on the T2DKP.
 Significance: The project would extend the T2DKP with new capabilities to integrate and display
datasets with information regarding causal variants, effector transcripts, and gene networks for T2D and its
complications. Public access to these data and results will significantly accelerate efforts to identify new
therapeutic strategies to prevent, treat, or reverse T2D and its complications.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
In this proposal we aim to identify gene regulatory elements that permit the targeting and manipulation of brain
circuit models of human brain function. Gaining genetic access to specific neuron populations in nontransgenic
animals and humans would enable targeted circuit modulation for hypothesis testing and provide a means to
evaluate the safety and efficacy of circuit modulation for the treatment of epilepsy and psychiatric disorders. Our
approach capitalizes on our combined expertise in the development and maturation of brain cell-types and
circuits (Gord Fishell), identification of CIS-regulatory elements that function across species (Jordane
Dimidschstein) and AAV engineering combined with large-scale screening methods (Ben Deverman). Our efforts
will benefit from an ongoing collaboration with John Reynolds at the Salk Institute on observation and
manipulation of cortical circuits during complex visual perception tasks. This project will build upon success that
we and others have had in identifying gene regulatory elements that enable cell type-restricted gene expression
when used within recombinant adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors. Identifying additional enhancer sequences
that function in the context of the limited carrying capacity of AAV has been slow due to the limited success rate
and low throughput nature of these efforts. Here we aim to apply a novel high-throughput screening approach
for the rapid identification of a suite of enhancers that enable the study and manipulation of genetically defined
cell types and circuits across species. Our preliminary data demonstrates that our enhancer identification
strategy can yield novel and highly specific enhancers that restrict expression to target populations. In addition,
we have demonstrated that it is possible to use the engineered AAV-PHP.eB capsid to screen enhancers across
the brain with a single noninvasive injection. These successes have highlighted the need for more rapid and
comprehensive assessment of putative enhancers. In the UH3 portion of this proposal we will examine the
tolerance to neuronal activity manipulation within the target neuronal populations in several species. We will also
apply the AAV-enhancer viruses for querying disease-related circuits using Rabies tracing in conjunction with
optogenetics. This proposal will be transformative in devising methods to target and manipulate the brain activity
of specific neuronal cell populations across species, including human cell-derived organoids.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Inflammation negatively affects Tregs stability and suppressive function, impairs the
induction of solid organ transplant tolerance and enhances acute and chronic rejection, leading
to worse recipients’ long-term outcomes. Insights into key inflammatory pathways that suppress
Tregs during allo-immune activation can revolutionize our therapeutic approach to promoting
stable endogenous Tregs.
 Our work strongly suggests that an inflammatory cytokine, macrophage migration
inhibitory factor (MIF), secreted by myeloid cells and alloreactive T cells during rejection and
inflammation binds CD74 (MIF receptor) on the surface of activated Tregs to dampen its function
and homeostasis with opposite effect on alloreactive T cells. We show that inhibiting this novel
pathway either through monoclonal antibodies or genetic deletion promotes immune regulation
and induce exhaustion of alloreactive T cells leading to indefinite heart allograft survival in a
murine fully mismatched model. MIF is a potent pro-inflammatory cytokine produced and released
by immune cells, particularly macrophages, and plays an integral role in innate immunity.
However, its role in adaptive immunity is not well known and will be investigated. Our data show
that graft infiltrating Tregs and Teff upregulate their expression of MIF receptor CD74. However,
graft infiltrating myeloid cells and Teff but not Tregs secrete MIF. MIF then binds to CD74 on
Tregs surface to suppress and on Teff to promote their function.
 Our single cell transcriptomic analysis, TCR sequencing, flow cytometry and functional
assays showed that CD74 deficient graft infiltrating Tregs reduced Interferon regulatory factor 1
(IRF1) and shifted toward a more stable Treg phenotype that exhibits superior suppressive ability
in vitro and in vivo. IRF1 is a negative regulator of Foxp3 transcriptional activity that contributes
significantly to Treg instability in the setting of inflammation. Interestingly, CD74 signaling is
exerted through its intracellular-domain (ICD), shown to bind to transcription factors to modulate
gene expression. Recent work identified IRF1 as one of the binding TFs for CD74-ICD13.
 In this application we will test the hypothesis that a novel inflammatory pathway in which
MIF produced by myeloid cells and Teff suppresses Treg function through IRF1 mediated CD74
signaling (SA1), while promoting the Teff function (SA2). We will also develop a clinically relevant
strategy to dampen the MIF mediated inflammatory process in the allograft using anti-CD74
monoclonal antibody generated in our lab (SA3). This anti-mouse CD74 is equivalent to the FDA
approved human anti CD74 (milatuzumab). Hence, this work has high translation potentials.

part of the virulence, and as supported by their underlying metabolism. Commensal metabolism
in the gut provides an opportunity to impede these processes by depriving pathogens of growth-
promoting nutrients. Using the amino acid and carbohydrate-fermenting pathogen Clostridioides
difficile, we will evaluate how redox metabolism of target carbon sources by the pathogen and
commensals can enhance or limit its ability to colonize and infect the gut. Analyses will leverage
innovative approaches to track nutrient flow among pathogen, commensal, and host tissues.
Studies will further perturb host environments using carbon sources that are fermented by the
pathogen, protective commensals, or both, to assess their role in disease pathogenesis and
progression. Findings will inform small molecule and bacteriotherapeutic interventions in disease

computational models of homeostatic regulation of intrinsic excitability (Project #4 of
P01 NS07949). Together these projects comprise a coherent attempt to understand
brain circuit stability in the face of: a) extensive neuromodulation, b) constant and rapid
turnover of ion channels and receptors, and c) degenerate and multiple solutions at the
single neuron and circuit level. These questions arise from years of computational and
experimental work using the small circuits of the crustacean stomatogastric ganglion
(STG), but address general problems relevant to all nervous systems, from invertebrates
to humans. Future experiments will combine experimental and computational work to
understand the correlations in biological parameters in neurons and networks that allow
any given parameter to be variable while the circuit itself retains robustness. Animal to
animal variability in response to perturbations will be measured, the strengths of all of
the synapses in STG circuits will be measured, and the regulation of multiple
neuromodulator receptors by single neurons will be studied. Additionally, self-tuning
models will be developed to find sets of neuronal parameters that allow neurons to
maintain stability in response to perturbations. This work will illuminate the extent to
which the same animal can potentially generate similar behavior by substantially
different (degenerate) circuit mechanisms at different times. If so, this can shed light on
how larger circuits may switch between a number of degenerate circuit mechanisms to
generate stable behaviors over time.

The overall goal of the NIGMS-funded research in my lab is to define the molecular and cellular mechanisms
underlying dynamic rearrangements of the actin cytoskeleton, and to explore how these mechanisms are
harnessed in vivo (in yeast and animal cells) to control diverse actin-based processes such as cell motility,
endocytosis, intracellular transport, and cell morphogenesis. Genetic and biochemical research has been
rapidly producing a ‘molecular parts list’ for the actin cytoskeleton, and many of the components have been
characterized individually for their biochemical effects on actin filaments and their genetic effects on cellular
actin organization and function. However, it is becoming clear that most of these proteins do not function alone,
but rather in groups to perform their biological roles, and thus, new approaches are needed to define how they
work in concert to perform their cellular functions. Our lab is tackling this problem using advanced single
molecule TIRF microscopy to directly observe multi-component actin regulatory mechanisms in real time, and
testing these mechanisms using genetic, cell biological, biochemical, and structural approaches. Through this
approach, we have made fundamental new insights into actin regulation. For instance, we defined the first
collaborative actin nucleation mechanisms of formins (with Bud6 & APC). We discovered that formins and
Capping Protein can bind simultaneously at filament ends to accelerate each other’s dissociation. We showed
that Cofilin, AIP1, and Coronin work together via an ordered mechanism to sever and disassemble F-actin. We
discovered that Srv2/CAP works in conjunction with Cofilin and Twinfilin to depolymerize filament ends. In
parallel, we have combined genetics, cellular imaging, and separation-of-function mutants to dissect the
contributions of these mechanisms to actin-based processes in yeast and mammalian cells.
Moving forward, we will ask the following questions: what are the complete regulatory cycles of the two yeast
formins (Bni1 and Bnr1)? How is Arp2/3 complex-mediated actin nucleation balanced by its inhibitors (Coronin
and GMF) and activators (Las17/WASP and Abp1)? How is actin nucleation at the leading edge of motile cells
controlled by interactions among IQGAP1, APC and formins? How do interactions at filament ends between
Capping Protein and formins (and their in vivo binding partners) control actin network growth? How do the
filament severing and depolymerization mechanisms (Cofilin, AIP1, Coronin, Twinfilin, and Srv2/CAP) drive net
disassembly of actin under the assembly-promoting conditions of the cytosol? Are there actin-associated
proteins that accelerate the nucleotide state transition on F-actin to promote disassembly? In addition, we will
introduce new technologies and directions to our research, including in vitro reconstitution of cellular actin
structures, cryo-EM to study protein structure, cell-free extracts to genetically-biochemically dissect actin
mechanisms, and a systems-level approach to determine how genetic disruptions in individual actin regulators
affect the cellular levels, localization, and functions of the remaining actin-associated proteins.

The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is one of the most important model organisms for biomedical
research, because of its biological tractability and because much of its physiology and behavior relies
on signaling pathways that are conserved in humans. The goal of this project is to complement the
highly developed genomics and genetics of C. elegans with a comprehensive structural and functional
characterization of its metabolome. In recent work we have shown that C. elegans utilizes small-
molecule architectures of unanticipated diversity and complexity in endocrine and exocrine signaling
that control almost every aspect of its life history, including development, aging, stress resistance, and
a wide range of behaviors. One major focus of our investigations is the elucidation of the biosynthesis
and perception mechanisms of newly identified small molecule signals, which will reveal how
metabolism and conserved signaling pathways interact to control phenotypes. Of particular interest
are (i) the roles of recently identified endogenous agonists of the nuclear receptor NHR-49, a key
regulator of lipid metabolism and functional ortholog of vertebrate PPARα, (ii) male germline-
dependent metabolites that accelerate development and aging via conserved pathways, including
homologs of mammalian steroid receptors, and (iii) our recent discovery of a modular glucosides that
appear to function as a “second layer” of neurotransmitter signaling. In addition, we will investigate the
biological functions of a new family of nucleoside derivatives we discovered that may interact with
purinergic signaling. Another focus area will be the influence of dietary bacteria on C. elegans small
molecule signaling, motivated by our discovery of unexpected roles for bacterial metabolites, e.g. in
modulating fat metabolism via NHR-49 or in serotonin signaling. Central to the proposed research is
the use of synthetic samples and derivatives of identified signaling molecules for bioassays, mutant
screens, and transcriptomic studies, as well as the in-house developed metabolomics platform
(Metaboseek), which greatly accelerates compound identification and functional annotation.
Successful conclusion of this project will provide a structural and functional annotation small molecule
signaling networks in C. elegans, substantially increasing our understanding of conserved pathways
that control development, aging and metabolism, as well as corresponding disease-relevant pathways
in mammals. The small-molecule knowledge generated will not only enable future efforts aimed at
more varied chemical genetic screens exploring additional aspects of the biology and ecology of C.
elegans, but also of nematode species relevant in agriculture or medicine. Furthermore, methodology
developed for characterizing C. elegans signaling molecules will facilitate similar studies toward
structural and functional characterization of small molecule metabolites from other model organisms.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
Both inputs to the brain and outputs from the brain occur over a broad range of timescales and
in many cases repeat rhythmically. Rhythmic changes in gene expression have been studied
in the brain only in the context of circadian rhythms. Additionally, shorter-than-a-day (ultradian)
rhythms have been sparsely reported and it is unknown how these rhythms originate,
particularly at the molecular level and whether they interact and/or share part of the
timekeeping machinery utilized by the circadian clock. Understanding how these rhythms are
generated and maintained will illuminate new aspects of brain gene expression and physiology
and open unexplored areas of research.
In an effort to reveal RNA oscillations at different timescales in the fly brain, we profiled fly brains
by RNAseq every two hours for three days. By analyzing these data, we identified dozens of
RNAs oscillating with 6-, 12-, and 24-hour rhythms in the brain. Interestingly, enrichment
analysis shows that more than half of these genes are highly expressed in the glia, suggesting
this cell type has oscillators operating at different timescales. The importance and novelty
of these results are two-fold: a. they demonstrate, for the first time, the presence of ultradian
RNA oscillations in the fly brain; b. suggest the existence of oscillators operating at
different timescales (circadian and ultradian) in the glial cells. In this context, the present
proposal aims to comprehensively identify the mechanisms responsible for ultradian
rhythmic gene expression in the glial cells within the fly brain. Our work will shed light on
new mechanisms of ultradian expression in flies for the first time. In addition, we will identify
and characterize new timekeeping or timer-like mechanisms operating in glial cells that also
have a circadian clock. Last, our work will provide new information and lead to developing tools
to perturb and investigate these rhythms in the future.
In sum, we are convinced that this project will uncover new modes of timed regulation of
transcription and physiology within the brain, which might be of vast importance beyond
Drosophila and uncover potential connections between ultradian and circadian oscillators
within these cells. This pioneering study will set the stage for further studying the role of
oscillations in the glia, a key cell type in the brain, as well as to understand the mechanism and
role of ultradian rhythms in general. As circadian rhythms have been linked to numerous diseases
including depression and sleep disorders, the present proposal has obvious implications for
human health.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：The goal of this proposal is to better characterize the cognitive and neural basis of face perception
heterogeneity in developmental prosopagnosia (DP) and to test whether potential perceptual subtypes are
better suited for one type of cognitive training program vs. another. This is relevant to the National Eye
Institute's mission to better treat visual disorders and understand mechanisms of visual function. Our pilot
results (N=45 DPs) provide preliminary evidence that there are perceptually-impaired (PI-DPs) and
perceptually-unimpaired (PU-DPs) DP subgroups that may be mechanistically distinct. We find that PI-DPs
have deficient eye processing, reduced holistic processing abilities, reduced N170 response to eye contrast-
reversed faces, and a trend towards decreased white matter integrity in the occipital face area, a face-selective
region involved in face parts processing. We also find that PI-DPs, compared to PU-DPs, show a greater
treatment response to our computerized face perception training program. The goals of the current proposal
are to build on these pilot results to further test and validate the PI-DP vs. PU-DP subgroup distinction, to
better understand the neural mechanisms underlying perceptual heterogeneity in DPs, and to examine
treatment implications of potential subgroups. In particular, our aims for this proposal are to: 1) Collect a large
sample of web-based and in-lab DPs (N=280) and controls (N=140) and replicate our pilot findings showing
eye processing and holistic processing deficits in PI-DPs. We will also perform latent profile analysis to
determine if DPs naturally form PI-DP vs. PU-DP subgroups or rather represent a continuum of face
perception deficits. 2) Characterize the neural mechanisms of DP face perception heterogeneity using
functional fMRI, EEG, and diffusion tensor imaging in 80 DPs and 40 controls. To test better understand the
neural underpinnings of DPs' reduced eye region sensitivity and reduced holistic processing, we seek examine
the N170 event-related potential response to isolated eyes vs. mouths as well as face inversion and for fMRI,
population receptive fields of face-selective regions as well as responses to isolated mouths and eyes. We will
also examine whether PI-DPs vs. PU-DPs have white matter integrity differences in face-selective white matter
regions. 3) Determine whether PI-DPs vs. PU-DPs have differential responses to face perception training, face
memory training, or face perception+face memory training programs. This will involve a longitudinal study of
120 DPs being assigned to either a waitlist control condition or 6 weeks of one of the three cognitive training
programs. Before and after training/waiting, we will assess DPs on a validated battery of face perception and
recognition tests as well as self-reported face recognition. To measure the longevity of potential training
effects, DPs will also repeat assessments after a 6-week no-contact period.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Brain photobiomodulation (PBM) using near-infrared (NIR) light is a promising new approach for treating
Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Despite the high interest in using PBM to treat AD, its application is currently
hindered by the insufficient understanding of the mechanisms of NIR light actions in the brain.
Additionally, NIR-I light (650-900 nm) has not achieved clinical significance due to its insufficient
penetration into the brain tissue. We hypothesize that the key mechanisms underlying treatment
properties of NIR light in AD include the activation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) in the
brain, increase of nitric oxide (NO) production by endothelial cells, vasomotion, increase of glymphatic
flow, and reduction of amyloid β load and tau pathology. Further, we hypothesize that these
mechanisms can be markedly enhanced by the pulsation of NIR-II light (1000-1700 nm) at a low
frequency during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. Our specific aims are designed to test the key
elements of this hypothesis. We plan to test that NIR light treatment is most efficient when it is delivered
in NIR-II window and during NREM sleep (aim 1), that the rate of NIR light stimulation rather than its
duration determines the efficiency of the PBM treatment in AD (aim 2), and that eNOS is the key
mediator of therapeutic effects of NIR light in AD, whereas neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) is not
(aim 3). Thus, we propose a series of translational studies that are aimed to improve our understanding
or the role of NIR light in reducing the AD pathology as well as to identify the way of NIR light delivery
that is most efficient in treating AD.

Cancer mortality rates in the US declined by 26% between 1991 and 2015, but the decline has not been equal
across all populations. Approximately 19% of the US population resides in rural areas; for over three decades,
this population has experienced increasingly inferior outcomes when compared with their urban counterparts.
The underlying cause(s) of the widening rural/urban gap in cancer outcomes is hypothesized to be multifactorial,
with socioeconomic status (SES) both at the individual-level and geographic area-level likely playing a significant
role. Gaps in evidence include the use of multiple “rural” definitions, a lack of evidence on associated geographic
factors, and limited evidence based on multi-level approaches to understand the complex nature of rural
disparities. Therefore, the overall objective of this study is to conduct a comprehensive examination of the
underlying causes of rural/urban disparities in mortality among individuals diagnosed with cancer. In the first aim,
the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) population-level data will be used to examine mortality
among individuals diagnosed with cancer across three definitions of rurality, providing researchers and policy
makers with the magnitude of differences by each definition. In the second aim, SEER will be linked via county-
indicators to 16 databases (US Census Bureau, Area Deprivation Index, Bureau of Labor Statistics, County
Health Rankings and Roadmaps, AMA Healthcare Workforce Mapper, BRFSS, Social Vulnerability Index, Health
Information National Trends Survey, etc.). These linkages will allow us to estimate the contribution of specific area-
level factors (e.g., area-level SES, access to high-quality care) on rural/urban mortality differences using effect
decomposition methodology. In the third aim, the Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke
(REGARDS) cohort (U01 NS041588) will be linked to state level cancer registry data using the Virtual Pooled
Registry Cancer Linkage System (VPR-CLS). REGARDS includes longitudinally collected data for 30,239
participants (44% blacks), oversampled from stroke belt/buckle states (56% of participants from NC, SC, GA,
TN, AL, MS, AK, LA) with large rural populations experiencing the highest mortality. REGARDS collects
information at the individual level on sociodemographics, health literacy, and distance to healthcare,
transportation, and risky health behaviors. Multi-level modeling and mediation modeling approaches will allow for
the examination of the contribution of individual-level characteristics and the area-level characteristics simultaneously.
Results will provide estimates of how much of the mortality disparity is explained by differences in urban and
rural geographic characteristics overall as well estimates that describe the potential impact of hypothetical
interventions on specific mediating factors. Findings will provide the critical evidence needed to inform policy and
intervention development aimed at addressing the systemic disparities in mortality experienced by rural patients
with cancer.

Lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) is a nuclear histone demethylase. Our work shows that LSD1 expression
progressively increases with tumor grade and stage in clinical oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Our long-
term goal is to evaluate LSD1 mechanism in progressive oral malignancy based on preliminary studies for
therapeutic applications. Recent preliminary studies showed that conditional LSD1 deletion in the tongue
epithelium during dysplasia reduced invasive pathological lesions, downregulated EGFR, YAP-induced signaling
network, and Pd-L1 expression. Next, the topical application of LSD1 inhibitor during dysplasia prevented its
progression to invasive phenotype, attenuated pathological lesions, expression of Hippo signaling effectors (Yap,
Taz, Ccn2,) and immune checkpoints (Pd-1, and Pd-l1). LSD1 inhibitor sensitized OSCC to combinations with
either YAP inhibitor, anti-PD-1, or anti-PD-L1 antibodies, limiting tumor progression in vivo. Thus, we showed
for the first time that blocking LSD1 inhibits preneoplasia, a feed-forward loop during the progression of
dysplasia to OSCC. Interestingly, LSD1 inhibition attenuates IL-6-JAK-STAT3 novel signaling identified in two
independent studies 1) proteomics analysis of LSD knockout mice preneoplasia and 2) single-cell RNAseq
analysis using LSD1 inhibitor. However, the mechanism of LSD1 function, its target cells in progressive oral
malignancy, and how LSD1 promotes IL-6-JAK-STAT3 remain unclear. This knowledge gap prevents the
targeted design of effective new epigenetic therapeutic strategies for OSCC. We hypothesize that (1) LSD1
upregulation during dysplasia reprograms oral tissue to invasive phenotype by acting on IL6 -signaling and
induced cell types and (2) pharmacological attenuation of LSD1 reset epigenome to reverse progressive
malignant preneoplasia to a noninvasive phenotype. Using clinically relevant animal models, this project is well-
positioned to address the following Specific Aims: 1) to determine how upregulated LSD1 epigenetically
reprogram dysplasia to promote IL6 network during progressive oral preneoplasia invasive phenotype; 2) to
determine if LSD1 collaborates with YAP to promote IL6-JAK-STAT3 network induced invasive phenotype in
preneoplasia, and 3) to determine the translational importance of pharmacological LSD1 inhibition reverse
preneoplasia by inhibiting IL6-JAK-STAT3 signaling induced cancer stem and immune cells. The successful
completion of the proposed project is expected to identify LSD1 and therapeutic application mechanisms in the
IL6-JAK-STAT3 network, related stem cells, and immune cells. Finally, the study will determine if LSD1 a role
in anti-PD-1 immunotherapy resistance and pharmacological LSD1 inhibition can attenuate feline OSCC for a
potential application in veterinary and human medicine. Overall, the study will have a broader impact on future
translational studies in human preneoplasia.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Co-occurring anxiety is prevalent in more than 50% of individuals with Opioid use disorder (OUD). This is of
major concern as safe and effective treatment options are lacking for this high-risk population. Anxiety in those
with OUD is linked to earlier and more rapid progression of OUD, and high probability of co-use of other
substances, particularly GABAA receptor positive modulators, such as benzodiazepines (BZDs). BZDs are
currently the standard of care treatment for fast-acting relief for general anxiety and panic disorder. Although
highly effective in the short-term, BZDs represent amajor, but often overlookedcontributorto the opioid overdose
epidemic. BZDs are involved in an estimated 12,000 overdose fatalities each year in the US, largely due to the
concomitant use with other CNS depressants, such as opioids. In fact, more than 90%of BZD overdose fatalities
involve opioids and up to 30% opioid overdoses involve BZDs. Additionally, BZD prescription rates are directly
linked to opioid overdose rates per state. With a lack of safe alternatives that can offer comparable efficacy, BZD
market predictions indicate their use will remain steady or increase globally. Thus, there is an urgent need to
develop safe and comparably effective alternatives to BZDs for those with OUD. We have discovered a novel
series of promising synthetic GABAAR active molecules Our lead molecule, RU-EC2-118, is a partial GABAAR
PAM with nanomolar potency at GABAAR subtypes and high oral bioavailability. Our in vivo studies in rodent
models, strongly support the potential for the mechanismof RUEC2-118 to provide effective fast-actinganxiolytic
activity and a safer profile with co-use with other CNS-depressing substances. The major technical aims of the
STTR parent grant is to provide proof-of-concept data supporting the feasibility of our approach in maintaining
efficacy and reducing overdoserisks. Specific aim3 is to test the desirability of our innovation through enrollment
in the NIH I-Corps program. Having previously completed the NSF National ICorps program, we successfully
validated the need for our innovation. During the NIH ICorps program, our main objective is to further investigate
the best pathways towards funding and commercialization of our innovation .

 The development of serial confocal and electron-microscopy (EM), and automated image
segmentation have allowed us to elucidate some of the structural details of the cortical circuit at the
cellular and synaptic level. This information is critical because there is a close link between the
morphological properties of circuits in different brain areas and their function. It is broadly accepted that
the canonical microcircuit of the cortex is a repeating motif across cortex. Once the structure and
function in the local motif is understood this could be applied across all of cortex. However, recently it
has been shown that there are major laminar, areal and species differences that need to be taken into
account by this model. Another important feature of the canonical circuit in sensory areas is that the
initial thalamocortical (TC) driving input to layer 4 in cortex, which was presumed to be weak, needs to
be massively amplified to obtain the observed rates of spiking. However, recent studies have shown
that the weak TC assumption, has underestimated the TC strength by 2-4 times. I hypothesis that,
although the canonical circuit may provide general framework for cortical circuit functioning, diverse
sensory brain areas have major laminar differences in their neuronal and synaptic distributions. These
differences will, in turn, reflect the diverse processing roles and capabilities of the brain areas. To test
this hypothesis I will examine three primary sensory areas in macaque monkey cortex using Focused
Ion Beam/Scanning EM to determine detailed synaptic connectivity, using high-resolution confocal
microscopy to provide large scale determination of specific synaptic connectivity, and using mid-
resolution confocal microscopy to determine global cell type distributions in specific brain regions. If, as
I hypothesize, there are major quantitative differences between areas that will reflect their diverse
processing roles and capabilities, this will call for a refinement of the concept of the canonical circuit.
These quantitative results are important to build realistic population based spiking models of cortex that
can reproduce many of the detailed functional characteristics that are found in the brain. They are also
important because understanding the basic cortical organization of the normal brain is essential, as it
provides the standard against which it can be judged which processes can be seen to be altered or
damaged in disorders that affect the cerebral cortex. Additionally, an important part of this project is my
professional development as a PI. As such, I have established a research enhancement plan to
increase my research scholarship and publications, with the final goal of acquiring non-SCORE
research support.

 Ethnic disparities represent a significant problem in modern dermatology, and additional efforts are required
to better understand mechanisms underlying the development of skin diseases in patients with skin of color.
 Inflammatory skin conditions (acne, atopic dermatitis, hidradenitis suppurativa) represent a group of
diseases, which disproportionally impact African American (AA) patients including children. Comparative
transcriptome analyses of the skin reveal higher expression of multiple inflammation-related genes in AA healthy
individuals compared to non-Hispanic White (NHW) individuals.
 Regulation of expression of the genes involved in inflammatory skin response occurs at several levels
including signaling/transcription factor-mediated and epigenetic mechanisms. Transposable elements (TEs) are
repetitive mobile segments of DNA that constitute 44%-55% of mouse or human genomes. Inappropriate TE
activation has been implicated in pathogenesis of over 120 human diseases including autoimmune disorders.
 Most TEs are transcriptionally inactive, while their aberrant activation result in a production of double-
stranded (ds) RNA and dsDNA triggering the dsRNA/DNA sensing mechanisms followed by anti-viral immune
response. In the epidermis, UV exposure activates transcription of endogenous retroviral sequences.
Endogenous retroviruses of the HERV-K and W families are significantly upregulated in psoriatic versus non-
lesional skin. However, contribution of TEs to regulation of skin inflammation in AA individuals remain unknown.
 In this Administrative Supplement application to AR078306-03 grant, we will test a hypothesis that aberrant
activation of TEs in epidermal keratinocytes serve as critical determinant driving inflammatory skin response in
individuals with understudied skin types, while pharmacological inhibition of the TE transcription with the
nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors provides a novel strategy for management of inflammatory skin
conditions in these individuals. This hypothesis will be addressed via two Specific Aims:
 1. Perform comparative analyses of the landscapes of transposable element expression in human
epidermal keratinocytes between understudied skin types and NHW skin and correlate these data with
gene expression and patterns of active/repressive covalent DNA/histone modifications.
 2. Define the effects of the inhibitors of dsRNA and dsDNA pathways on expression of inflammation-
associated genes in epidermal keratinocytes isolated from understudied skin types in 3D skin equivalent
culture and in experimental in vitro models of skin inflammation.
 The generated outputs from this application will provide novel insights into fundamental mechanisms
regulating inflammation in understudied human skin types, as well as will promote the development of novel
paradigms for management of skin inflammatory responses in humans via modulation of TE activities.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Black Americans are twice as likely as White Americans to have Alzheimer’s disease (AD), independent of
genetic risk. Despite this knowledge, little is known about whether and how chronic experiences of racism
contribute to medial temporal hippocampal (MTH) and prefrontal-executive system integrity, systems that
exhibit profound neurodegeneration in AD and vulnerability to chronic stress. Although comorbid illnesses and
socioeconomic status contribute to the AD health disparity, disparities remain. This highlights a critical unmet
need for understanding social and societal stressors to disparities in brain health. A major contributor to health
inequities in the U.S. is chronic stress due to the cumulative effects of racism over the lifetime. The impact of
chronic interpersonal and institutional/structural racism, unique and salient forms of chronic stress in Black
Americans, on the neurocognitive integrity of these brain systems is not well understood. Since perceived
racism contributes to health disparities in cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors, which are also risk factors
for AD, perceived racism should have a significant impact also on the AD health disparity. The objective of the
parent R01 grant is to investigate the impact of racism on 1) CVD risk and 2) neurocognitive MTH-memory and
prefrontal-executive system integrity in Black seniors and to examine potentially underlying biological
mechanisms. The research objective of this diversity supplement is to examine the impact of consequences of
structural racism on neurocognitive integrity, namely 1) acculturation, a social compensatory mechanism
defined as the incorporation of the cultural norms of the social majority within a society, and 2) lower education
quality, leading to poorer dementia-related health literacy and greater public stigma associated with AD. The
central hypothesis of the parent R01 grant is that cognitively healthy Black seniors who have experienced
higher levels of chronic racism will show greater CVD risk and poorer MTH and prefrontal integrity than those
who have experienced fewer instances of racism over their lifetime. CVD risk and mental health may mediate
(i.e., explain) the relationship between racism burden and neurocognitive integrity. This diversity supplement
extends the parent grant by examining the relationships between AD-related health literacy, and public stigma
associated with AD with cognitive and neuroimaging outcomes (Aim 1) and acculturation (Aim 2) with cognitive
and neuroimaging outcomes. Aim 3 is exploratory and will examine racism burden and public stigma as
moderators of the relationship between acculturation and neurocognitive outcomes. The proposed diversity
supplement is for the candidate to gain expertise in how proxies of anti-Black structural racism affect brain
health in older Black self-identifying adults. To achieve these goals, in addition to the research aims outlined
above, the candidate is proposing training in multimodal neuroimaging (i.e., structural and fMRI) and statistical
modeling, and advancing mastery of MTH- and prefrontal-dependent functions related to anti-Black
racism. This supplement will set up the candidate for success in independent neurocognitive aging research.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Alternative splicing (AS) of precursor mRNA provides an important means of genetic control and is a crucial
step in the expression of most genes. AS gives rise to multiple isoforms that can exhibit differential stabilities,
molecular binding capabilities, and phenotypic effects, thereby greatly expanding the functional capacity of
genes. These functions are frequently deregulated in human disease, leading to aberrantly expressed isoforms
that can act as drivers and “rewirers” of cellular pathways. Given the intrinsic role of AS in nearly every aspect
of biology, tools and technologies for the functional understanding of isoforms are desperately needed.
Unfortunately, prediction of isoform functions are notoriously difficult, due to our only crude understanding of
the molecular determinants of isoform activities as well as a paucity of experimental datasets annotated at
isoform resolution. The experiments, in turn, are challenging in their own right, due to a lack of robust methods
for the detection, mapping, and phenotyping at isoform-resolution in vivo. As a consequence, one of the
biggest gaps in the genomics and proteomics fields is an understanding the functional and evolutionary
implications of the astonishing complexity of the human proteome.
To make progress towards this gap, we must reformulate existing approaches. Here, we propose to build
computational and experimental methodologies that are intertwined across the entire development and
evaluation lifecycle. Computational approaches, capitalizing on ever-improving machine learning algorithms,
can predict the effect of AS at high coverage. Experimental validation, on the other hand, is critical to
benchmark the predictions as well as shed light on heretofore uncharacterized features of isoform functionality.
The goals of this project are to develop (i) a predictor of protein isoform stability, a “first line of evidence” and
prerequisite of isoform functionality, (ii) a novel bioinformatics approach to study the “rewiring” effects of AS
isoforms on protein interactions, and (iii) a novel measure, the alternative splicing impact factor, that predicts
the functional role of an isoform based on metrics such as the loss of interaction and expression patterns, and
apply this concept to determine AS-induced phenotypes in-silico and in vitro/vivo (cell-based assay). Each
computational stage will be closely complemented with a highly customized and novel experimental approach–
large-scale isoform proteogenomics, interactomics, and functional assays experiments–to validate and
benchmark the predictors, as well as feed into an iterative computation-experimental “virtuous cycle”.

This R21 proposal tests the hypothesis that environmental chemicals target microglia, the resident
immune cells in the brain and alterations in microglial function contributes to the risk of development
of neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders. Microglia play an important role in responding
to inflammation and immune challenge in the brain. They also have been shown to have a number of
important roles beyond immune response, including synaptic pruning during development and adult
neurogenesis. Microglial activation has been shown to be involved in the progression of different
neurodegenerative diseases as well as in several neuropsychiatric conditions. Accumulating evidence
suggests that environmental chemical exposure increases the susceptibility to the development of
various neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders. A majority of the studies investigating the
impacts of environmental chemical exposure on microglia have been conducted using in vitro cell
culture systems and very little is known about in vivo effects, especially during early life.
The proposed research is aimed at understanding the role of environmental chemical exposure on
microglial dysfunction in vivo in a well-established developmental model system using imaging,
molecular and behavioral approaches. It has two specific aims. In specific aim 1, we test the
hypothesis that exposure of zebrafish to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) causes microglial
activation. These studies will be conducted using a range of environmentally relevant concentrations
of PCB126, a dioxin-like PCB that is ubiquitously distributed in the environment. Using transgenic
zebrafish expressing cell-specific fluorescent markers and time-lapse confocal imaging, we will
measure microglial morphology in response to exposure. In addition, the potential effects of microglial
activation on neuronal network as well as neurobehaviors will be quantified. In specific aim 2, we will
test the hypothesis that PCB-induced microglia dysfunction is AHR dependent. Using AHR null
zebrafish, we will characterize the role of AHR in microglial activation. Wild type and AHR null
zebrafish will be exposed to a concentration of PCB126 that affected microglia and characterize the
effects both immediately after exposure and later in life. We will characterize the brain specific
transcriptional and epigenetic profiles associated with these changes using single cell RNA
sequencing and single cell DNA methylation profiling. The results from the proposed studies will
provide fundamental knowledge about the role of environmental chemicals on immune cells in the
brain.

The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) is a bHLH-PAS protein that in vertebrate animals is a ligand-activated
transcription factor that plays essential roles in the regulation of xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes and in the
mechanisms of toxicity of numerous environmental contaminants, including chlorinated dioxins such as
2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), some polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polynuclear aromatic
hydrocarbons (PAHs), and some emerging contaminants. The AHR is also involved in a variety of
physiological processes including development, hematopoiesis, immunity, host-microbiome interactions, and
barrier organ function. In contrast to most ligand-activated transcription factors that have narrow ligand-
specificity, the vertebrate AHR is highly promiscuous, recognizing a diverse array of chemicals. In addition to
the well-known xenobiotics, AHR ligands include dietary phytochemicals, microbiome-derived microbial
metabolites, and endogenous metabolites such as tryptophan catabolites, all of which collectively contribute to
the internal chemical exposome. A comprehensive mechanistic understanding of AHR’s role in the response to
environmental exposures has been hindered by the complexity of its physiological functions and the
bewildering diversity of its ligands. Here, we propose a set of innovative molecular studies to elucidate the
sequence-structure-function determinants of AHR ligand-dependence and the origin of its ligand diversity.
Evidence suggests that the AHR evolved from a ligand-independent (constitutively active) ancestor. The
proposed basic research will experimentally determine the evolutionary trajectory and underlying genetic and
structural mechanisms that drove the evolution of AHR ligand-dependence and promiscuity. In Aim 1, we will
establish the ligand-specificity of AHRs from present-day species through a systematic experimental
assessment of phylogenetically diverse metazoan AHRs, including new invertebrate and early vertebrate
AHRs. In Aim 2, we will use ancestral sequence reconstruction (ASR) to “resurrect” ancestral AHR proteins
and then determine their ligand-binding sensitivity and specificity, revealing the identities of ancestral and
derived ligands. In Aim 3, we will use phylogenetic and protein structural analysis to identify candidate
historical amino acid changes that caused the acquisition of ligand-binding and evolution of promiscuity. We
will test these hypotheses by engineering ancestral and extant proteins containing these substitutions and
experimentally assessing their function. Understanding the ancestral properties of the primordial ligand-
activated AHR and the mechanisms that drove the evolution of promiscuity will provide essential new insights
into the natural physiological ligands and biological functions of extant AHR, reveal the genetic and structural
mechanisms underlying AHR ligand recognition, and elucidate how and why AHR function is disrupted by
anthropogenic environmental contaminants.

of research projects using novel in situ sampling technologies and modeling approaches building on prior
research to address how changing climate could influence harmful algal bloom (HAB) dynamics and human
exposure to HAB toxins, a serious and global human health threat. The overall objective is to protect public
health through enhanced understanding of how climate and oceanic processes affect the intensity and
distribution of toxin-producing HABs and to understand the potential health risks from exposure even to low
levels of their potent neurotoxins, especially during susceptible stages of life. The Center will focus on two key
HAB taxa: Alexandrium catenella, which produces the saxitoxins responsible for paralytic shellfish poisoning
(PSP), and Pseudo-nitzschia spp., which produce domoic acid responsible for amnesic shellfish poisoning
(ASP) syndrome, both are expanding geographically. Novel, targeted, efficient, and data-rich sampling
approaches developed by the applicants and applied in situ in natural settings have revealed new controls of
A. catenella population dynamics, and have identified possible new climate links regarding toxic Pseudo-
nitzschia species. Project 1 will examine further the physiological and climatic variables affecting these HABs,
which may underlie population adaptation in different habitats and different environmental regimes. Project 2
will incorporate these new and fundamental insights on bloom regulation into coupled climate-population
models to predict HAB threats under future climate scenarios, a key step toward being able to quantify future
risks from this recurrent public health threat. In biomedical studies with the zebrafish model, Project 3 has
identified myelination in the developing brain as a target of domoic acid. They will use transgenic zebrafish and
single-cell RNA-sequencing to identify the cell-specific mechanisms underlying effects of domoic acid,
saxitoxin, and the cyanotoxin anatoxin-a in zebrafish embryos in vivo and will use human iPSC-derived 3D
brain systems in vitro to elucidate toxin effects on neural and glial cell differentiation in human cells. Studies
also will determine whether prior exposure to ubiquitous persistent organic pollutants may modify effects of
subsequent exposure to saxitoxin and domoic acid. All projects will collaborate in modeling to link oceanic
processes to human exposure, helping to define the exposure of susceptible human subpopulations and
predict the effects of a changing climate. The Community Engagement Core will facilitate integration of the
research with education and engagement of resource managers and other stakeholders. We also will improve
awareness of emerging HAB issues for the public health community and develop new educational materials
and interactive activities for K-12 classrooms, and for health care providers. An Administrative Core will
encourage open discussion of planning, integration, communication and enhancing diverse perspectives, and
provide rigorous evaluation of progress in all aspects of the program.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：The corticospinal tract (CST) is a critical circuit underlying skilled voluntary movements. Damage to this circuit
during development can cause permanent, long-term movement disability in humans. Recognizing and treating
such developmental CST damage is challenging, largely because immediately after the lesion, there are limited
or almost no functional deficits. However, early recognition and intervention with the appropriate treatment
measures is key to reducing long-term disability. The use of preclinical mouse models, which have otherwise
proven to be highly useful in functional investigations of nervous system development, has been limited in this
regard. Since the CST is known to control skilled movements, established behavioral tests in mice that
investigate CST function require training mice in skilled tasks. This precludes their application in neonatal mice.
Further, mouse models used to investigate developmental CST damage, e.g. neonatal hypoxia or spinal injuries,
do not only damage the CST; rather they disrupt multiple neural pathways. It therefore remains completely
unknown whether the CST contributes only to skilled movements in adult mice, or whether it also contributes to
the development of natural, innate motor ability during development, beginning in neonatal mice. This latter
possibility would suggest that there are early, albeit subtle, behavioral correlates of developmental CST injury in
mice. We recently developed a new microsurgical approach to specifically disrupt the developing CST in
neonatal mice. In addition, we have also established the use of Motion Sequencing (MoSeq), a new machine
learning and artificial intelligence platform, to longitudinally investigate the development of natural movements
in neonatal mice. Our preliminary results using MoSeq suggest that developmental damage to the CST results
in specific changes to movement structures in mice, as early as P12; these extend into maturity at P35. Further,
analysis of these P35 mice using conventional metrics of locomotion such as the Catwalk, did not identify any
deficits, highlighting the sensitivity of MoSeq in identifying changes in mouse movements. This proposal
investigates the hypothesis that the CST controls development of natural mouse movements, and not only skilled
movements at maturity. We will use MoSeq to analyze Fezf2 knock out (Fezf2 KO) mice in which the CST is
never established during development (Aim1), as well as mice that undergo microsurgical lesions to disrupt
spinal connectivity of the CST at distinct developmental times (Aim2). Together, our work will identify novel
functional readouts of developmental damage to the CST using natural mouse movements. This new unbiased
quantitative approach toward investigating the earliest behavioral signs of corticospinal dysfunction in mice which
will have eventual application in investigations of descending circuits of motor control, as well as multiple
preclinical models of developmental damage such as neonatal hypoxia or spinal injuries.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Subcerebral projection neurons (SCPN) reside in the neocortex, and extend axons to subcerebral targets in the
brainstem and spinal cord. Corticospinal neurons (CSN), a subclass of SCPN, project to the spinal cord and their
axons form the corticospinal tract (CST), a critical circuit for voluntary motor control. In addition, projections from
the neocortex to brainstem targets function in parallel with CSN to exert motor control. Degeneration of these
projection neurons in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), along with degeneration of spinal motor neurons,
causes spasticity and paralysis. In humans, damage to the CST after spinal cord injury is a principal cause of
loss of voluntary motor control. Further, integrity of corticospinal connectivity is centrally linked to recovery from
stroke and cerebral palsy. There have been multiple investigations detailing the role of cortico-brainstem vs.
corticospinal projections in both motor control, as well as their distinct contributions to functional recovery in
these distinct causes of paralysis. However, it remains unclear when and how these distinct projections are
established during development. Understanding the molecular basis of this specification and differentiation
during development therefore holds significant promise in establishing approaches that are tailored to enhancing
plasticity of these related, yet distinct circuits. A necessary first step toward this ultimate goal is to identify the
molecular mechanisms directing SCPN axons to brainstem (cortico-brainstem neurons) versus spinal cord
(CSN). Ongoing work in our lab has identified that such projections are initially specified during the process of
axon extension during development. We have identified that cortico-brainstem and corticospinal neurons express
distinct genes and can be molecularly distinguished in mice by birth. Further our data suggest that the
transcriptional regulator Satb2 acts, in part, to specify cortico-brainstem neurons. This proposal investigates the
hypothesis that transcriptional regulation controls the development of cortico-brainstem vs. corticospinal
projections by late embryonic development in mice. Building on this foundation, we will first identify the time point
in development when these projections are specified using knock-in Cre reporter mice (Aim 1). This will be tested
using intracerebral injections of AAV-reporters at distinct developmental times in utero with adult analysis of
axonal projections. In Aim 2, we will investigate the transcriptional targets of Satb2 in SCPN at later
developmental times by profiling all SCPN in Satb2 WT and conditional KO mice, as well as by Satb2
overexpression, at single cell resolution. Finally, in Aim 3 using subpopulation-specific transgenic Cre lines, we
will investigate SCPN axon targeting in both Satb2 loss- and gain-of-function. In addition, we will investigate
whether misexpression of Satb2 target genes can alter SCPN targeting to the brainstem vs. spinal targets.
Together, our work will discern in-depth, the mechanisms of when and how transcriptional regulation controls
SCPN segmental “identity” thereby providing a mechanistic framework for subsequent identification of molecules
controlling segmentally appropriate SCPN connectivity with subcerebral targets.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Abstract (Summary): In patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and the related motor
neuron disease (MND) primary lateral sclerosis (PLS), deficits in motor control occur as a consequence
of the degeneration of corticospinal neurons (CSNs). ALS is more common than PLS, and genetically
more complex, with familial forms associated with causal mutations in over 30 ALS-related genes. In
these ALS mice, however, dysfunction and degeneration of CSNs have not been carefully examined,
and data implicating corticospinal (CS) circuits in these model systems of ALS is surprisingly limited.
One reason for this may be the very different pattern of connectivity between CSNs and spinal MNs in
humans vs. mice. In humans, CS axons located in the ventral and lateral funiculi form direct
connections with both MNs (cortico-motoneuronal (CM) connections) and interneurons. In contrast,
CS axons in mice are located mainly in the dorsal funiculus and only form indirect connections with
MNs through pre-motor interneurons. Therefore, we will use PlexinA1 mutant mice which have CM
connections together with ALS mouse models to analyze CS circuits. Our central hypothesis is that
progressive defects in CS circuitry in ALS mice will be exacerbated by the establishment of CM
connections. In Aim 1, we will determine formation of CS circuits in ALS mouse models with CM
connections. In Aim 2, we will determine function of CS circuits in ALS mouse models with CM
connections. In Aim 3, we will examine skilled movements in ALS mouse models with CM connections.
These studies will provide a model system to study mechanisms of CS degeneration in ALS/PLS, and
to test novel therapeutics targeting upper motor neuron dysfunction in these disorders.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：The highly orchestrated muscle activation sequences during motor behaviors are achieved directly through the
fine-tuned firing of motor neurons in the ventral spinal cord. These motor neurons are mainly regulated by spinal
interneurons present in all mammals, which are, in turn, connected to other spinal neurons as well as various
types of descending neurons from the brain, such as corticospinal (CS), reticulospinal and rubrospinal neurons.
Until recently, the identities and functioning of the interneuron subtypes and descending neurons participating in
individual circuits had remained elusive. What remains lacking is knowledge of the arrangement and functional
role of the spinal interneuron subtypes in individual circuits. There is, therefore, a critical need to determine the
anatomical and functional connectivity of these spinal interneuron subtypes and how they regulate motor
behaviors. Our overall objectives in this application are to (i) map anatomical and functional connectivity of
different classes of spinal interneurons (Aims 1 & 2), and (ii) elucidate how those interneurons effect motor
behaviors (Aim 3). Our central hypothesis is that each interneuron subtype will exhibit preferential connections
with distinct descending neurons to control discrete forms of locomotor and skilled movements.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Corticospinal neurons (CSN) reside in the neocortex, and extend axons to specific segmental targets in the
spinal cord forming the corticospinal tract (CST). CSN critically control voluntary movement and are centrally
involved in recovery from paralysis originating from multiple causes, e.g., stroke, spinal cord injury (SCI), cerebral
palsy, etc.. CSN degeneration in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), along with degeneration of spinal motor
neurons, causes spasticity and paralysis. Recovery in all these distinct causes of paralysis would ultimately
require long-distance CST regeneration, which remains an unattained goal in regenerative neuroscience.
Previous work using neonatal lesions has established CST regenerative ability declines from development into
adulthood. When the CST is damaged in early life, there is greater plasticity and regeneration as compared to
similar lesions in the adult. However, despite this work, we still do not know when long-distance regenerative
ability is lost during development. This is because a key limitation of these established neonatal lesion models
is that they massively disrupt the spinal environment and thereby interfere with the normal process of long-
distance CSN axon extension during development. This limits the ability of these lesion paradigms to assess the
ability of the CNS to support long-distance regeneration. We recently established a novel microsurgical approach
to axotomize the CST during development, while leaving the spinal environment relatively intact. We identified
that long-distance CST regenerative ability is lost at different times at distinct spinal levels– at postnatal day 4
(P4) the CST can fully regenerate when lesioned at thoracic T11, but fails to do so when lesioned at cervical C2.
Our results indicate that the loss of long-distance CST regenerative ability closely parallels the developmental
timeline of normal CST growth into the spinal cord, which suggests that the normal process of differentiation,
both in CSN and in the spinal cord, results in the loss of long-distance regenerative ability. This proposal
investigates the hypothesis that inhibition of differentiation to prolong the immature developmental state will
extend the time window when long-distance regeneration is possible. Specifically, we will manipulate the function
of RE1 silencing transcription factor (REST), a global repressor of neural differentiation, to test this hypothesis.
Building on this foundation, we will first manipulate REST function (both gain- and loss-of function) at distinct
spinal levels to investigate whether this affects the ability of these spinal segments to support long-distance CST
regeneration (Aim1). We will manipulate REST function in CSN to similarly investigate long-distance CST
regeneration (Aim 2). Finally, we will use single cell profiling to investigate potentially distinct molecular effects
of microlesions at distinct spinal levels on distinct CSN subsets depending on their developmental state (Aim 3).
Together, our work will discern novel molecular mechanisms of how long-distance CST regeneration is regulated
during development, thereby providing a mechanistic framework for subsequent identification of molecules that

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Experimental data linking thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency to Alzheimer’s disease (AD) inspired our
clinical trial, which generated preliminary evidence that pharmacological thiamine produced by the drug
benfotiamine provides clinical benefit. We hypothesize that pharmacological thiamine is protective by diminishing
the formation of advanced glycation endproducts (AGE). AGE are proteins and lipids that become glycated and
harmful following exposure to reducing sugars. AGE cause irreversible damage to biological macromolecules by
altering their structural and functional integrity. Abundant evidence links AGE to AD. In AD animal models,
thiamine deficiency increases AGE and exacerbates plaques and tangle formation, while increased thiamine
diminishes AGE and pathology. In our pilot clinical trial, pharmacological thiamine levels diminished global
plasma AGE levels and improved symptoms in patients with AD. Interestingly, in AD patients, the effects of high
thiamine are diminished in patients carrying the APOE4 genotype, the most significant genetic risk factor for
sporadic AD. We postulate that this is because APOE4 increases unique AGE at earlier stages.
 Optimizing this therapeutic approach requires a better understanding of the mechanism underlying the
action of benfotiamine. All previous related AD and thiamine studies have utilized AGE antibody surveys. This
data is limited to a small range of AGE and provides no data on the proteins and specific sites modified with
glycation. We will provide this critical data by using multiple state-of-the-art mass spectrometric measures of
AGE. Global glycaproteomics will identify glycated proteins and specific sites of AGE modifications and AGE-
omics will identify a broad range of crosslinking and non-crosslinking AGE. A second major gap is the lack of
our understanding on how APOE4 modifies the response to thiamine. Novel APOE3 and APOE4 humanized
APP mouse models will allow us to test these interactions. We will test our hypotheses: (1) In AD autopsy
brains at different stages of the disease, AGE modifications are critical to the pathophysiology of AD in
an APOE-dependent manner. (2) In mouse models of AD, thiamine deficiency drives AD-like pathology
and memory loss by causing specific brain and blood AGE modifications which are modified by APOE
genotype. (3) In mouse models, benfotiamine is beneficial by diminishing specific AGE and the treatment
must be initiated at an earlier stage of disease in APOE4 mice.
 These studies will dramatically improve our understanding of the role of AGE in AD and its link to a treatment
of pharmacological thiamine levels. Defining the interaction of AGE and thiamine in the etiology and progression
of AD will enable the development of specific AGE signatures for targets of engagement for therapeutic trials
and as AD diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers. These studies will define the differential effectiveness of
thiamine by APOE genotype and define the most effective therapeutic approach for APOE3 and consistently
hard to treat APOE4 carriers. We therefore expect this study will have a high impact on translational AD medicine.

The ability to regulate when and how emotions are used to guide cognition relies on adaptive and plastic circuits
that can integrate internal limbic-visceral and external sensory-motor information for a given behavioral context.
The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is an area that plays an important role in this process of emotional regulation
and multimodal integration, acting as a unique connectional node for the otherwise segregated cognitive, motor
and limbic networks. The ACC forms a robust network with the amygdala (AMY), a key limbic structure for
emotion and arousal, which exhibits specialized circuit reorganization and plasticity during emotional stress. Our
previously funded R01 (MH116008) focused on comparing the ACC with the lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC),
another region implicated in cognition and stress, and on the extrinsic ACC pathways to cognitive/motor and
limbic areas. It remains unclear how exactly these multimodal pathways interact across the functionally distinct
rostral ‘cognitive’ (a32), ventral ‘limbic’ (a25) and dorsal ‘motor’ (a24) subdivisions of the ACC, which is the focus
of this renewal application. Our work in the previous grant period has shown that the robust ACC interconnections
with AMY span all ACC areas and are therefore, well-suited for integrating information across these distinct ACC
functional domains. Further, compared to ACC projections to cognitive/motor areas in LPFC and dorsal premotor
(PMd) cortices, AMY-targeting ACC pyramidal neurons show greater laminar diversity in their distribution, and
biophysical, structural, and inhibitory synaptic properties. Computational modeling show that these unique single-
cell biophysical and connectional properties contribute to diverse laminar oscillatory dynamics in ACC outputs to
AMY, which can support synchrony at low frequencies in L5, but at high frequencies in L3. In contrast, cortico-
cortical ACC outputs to PMd are more tuned towards higher oscillatory frequencies in both layers. While we have
shown how these extrinsic ACC outputs are diverse at the single cell level, the question remains as to how
multimodal information is integrated within the ACC. This renewal focuses on the largely uncharacterized short-
range interconnections within and between the functionally distinct ACC areas that are likely important for this
multimodal integration. Using anatomical tract-tracing, optogenetics, slice physiology, high-resolution
microscopy and computational modeling we propose to assess intrinsic ACC-ACC interconnections in adult
rhesus monkeys (5-13Y) with regards to their: excitatory vs inhibitory constituents, neuromodulation of synaptic
plasticity, interactions with long-range cognitive (LPFC), motor (PMd) and limbic (AMY) pathways, and
contributions to diverse network dynamics. The overall hypothesis is that distinct short-range intrinsic ACC
circuits have specialized excitatory, inhibitory and neuromodulatory properties and interactions with
long-range cortico-limbic pathways, which endow diverse network oscillatory dynamics and plasticity
in the ACC. Novel data from this study will yield new insights into how selective circuit neuromodulation within
distinct ACC networks can lead to normal cognitive-affective behavior and its dysfunction in the primate.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Amyloid diseases afflict 10 million patients worldwide. This project is focused on AA amyloidosis, a life-threatening complication of chronic inflammation wherein deposition of serum amyloid A (SAA), and its fragments causes kidney and liver damage and, if untreated, death. There is no cure for AA and the treatment options are very limited. To help design amyloid-specific therapies, we will determine how lipids and GAGs, the major ligands of SAA, influence its misfolding. Our prior research revealed that SAA clears diverse lipids from the sites of injury by sequestering them into nanoparticles that facilitate sPLA2 lipolysis; we established the structural basis for this SAA action. Our goal now is to determine how this lipid-scavenging function is linked to pathologic amyloid deposition. Our hypothesis rooted in extensive pilot studies is that lipoprotein formation by SAA is antagonistic to amyloid formation while GAG binding is agonistic. Our powerful approach integrates an array of biochemical, biophysical and computational methods to test this and other new ideas in 3 complementary Specific Aims. Aim 1 will determine how biochemical composition of SAA-lipid complexes influences amyloid formation. Murine or human recombinant SAA will be reconstituted with diverse lipids in complexes that will be selectively hydrolyzed, and amyloid formation will be explored by spectroscopic, electron microscopic, immunochemical and other tools. The results will help identify key steps in SAA-lipid homeostasis that critically influence amyloid formation, and will test a fascinating idea: lipid-modifying strategies may help treat AA amyloidosis. Aim 2 will dissect the amyloidogenic pathways of lipid-bound and free SAA and how GAGs affect these pathways. We will explore the interplay between SAA binding to lipids and GAGs, lipolysis, and formation of amyloid oligomers and fibrils. The results will help target SAA-GAG interactions in AA and other amyloid diseases. Aim 3 will utilize our new versatile ELISA-based assay that uses micrograms of protein to quantify the binding to amyloid modulators during fibrillogenesis. SAA binding to various GAG mimetics and small-molecule drugs will be used as a model; key results will be validated by other methods. Our pilot studies explain the failure of prior clinical trials for AA and suggest that larger molecules can block the SAA-GAG binding. Moreover, we will use our new assay to determine how other amyloid proteins (A, -synuclein, tau, TTR, etc.) interact with diverse amyloid modulators (GAGs, apoE, etc.) Impact: this project will advance AA research and therapeutic targeting to a new level. Moreover, it will develop new tools and concepts that can be extrapolated to other systemic and neurodegenerative amyloid diseases, such as Alzheimer’s and other major diseases.

The Summer Program in Neuroscience (SPIN) at Boston University School of Medicine is a unique, annual 8-
week program in which 10–15 undergraduate students perform mentored neuroscience research, receive
instruction in graduate-/medical-level neuroscience, and observe clinical activities focused on the diagnosis and
treatment of brain disorders. In the classroom, students meet with decorated medical school teaching faculty
and learn basic and clinical neuroscience through small-group interactive sessions, analysis of clinical and
research problems and cases, analysis of brain structure using microscopic brain sections and magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) brain scans, as well as hands-on exploration and dissection of human brains. For the
research portion of the program, students are paired with a faculty member from a basic science or clinical
department and conduct a mentored research project, the results of which are presented at a public conference
that closes the session. In the clinic, students rotate on neurology and neurosurgery inpatient and outpatient
services, attend brain cuttings sessions in the hospital morgue, and review radiographic studies with working
neuroradiologists. These three aspects of the program intersect to generate a nuanced education in the structure
and function of the brain in health and disease from both research and clinical perspectives. To help participants
integrate SPIN experiences with their future, sessions are held that focus on scientific skills and career
development, including sessions on applying to graduate and medical schools, developing oral presentation
skills, and interview skills. End-of-program interviews with prior participants indicate students felt that SPIN was
a life-changing experience that encouraged and helped them pursue further graduate and medical education.
Although we have made every attempt to recruit students from traditionally underrepresented minority
backgrounds, the tuition-based model of our program has been a significant barrier. As a result, SPIN participants
have lacked the diversity that characterize the ideal clinical and research teams. Funding from this proposal
would subsidize the cost of participating in the program (tuition and housing) and provide stipend support for six
scholarships. We will target recruitment to outstanding underrepresented minority students in institutions and
biomedical conferences historically attended by these students, and restructure our application and our
admittance for tuition-based students to place an emphasis on accepting students who have demonstrated
commitment to diversity. We also propose to change the program to target specific scientific skills and expand
programming of career development. Finally, we will implement a thorough real-time tracking and evaluation
plan to follow our students and measure the impact of the program on their career choices through the
establishment of digitally-based interactions and communities. The goal of this proposal is to provide talented
students from underrepresented populations with access to formative experiences and training that will guide
them toward successful biomedical careers and thus diversify the biomedical workforce.

There is growing evidence demonstrating that extreme heat is adversely impacting the mental health of
exposed populations. However, there is a need for further research at high spatial and temporal scales that
allows for investigation of the role of potential neighborhood-level mediators (e.g., residential greenness or air
pollution) and the impacts in potentially vulnerable subgroups. In this mixed-methods study we will investigate
the impact of extreme heat on mental health among uninsured and publicly insured individuals in the City of
Boston, with a particular focus on understanding how both environmental factors and individual behavioral
patterns influence the effects of heat on mental health within this high-risk population. We will first leverage
data (2005 – 2019) from a unique emergency services program (Boston Emergency Services Team [BEST])
that services ~18,000 publicly insured and uninsured persons each year in the greater Boston area. In Aim 1,
we will assess the relationship between temperature and psychiatric emergency services encounters in the
BEST data, with particular focus to diurnal variation in exposure-response that can be leveraged to provide
additional care for these high-risk patients. In Aim 2, we will supplement this quantitative data with the
collection of semi-structured qualitative interviews with clinicians who are treating BEST patients during warm
periods (May 2024 – September 2024). The objective of these interviews is to assess BEST clinician
perspectives on the role that extreme heat plays in mental illness, as well as the feasibility of proposed
interventions within the BEST population. We will also identify key resources needed by clinicians to support
patients who may not have access to traditional protective measures (such as in-home air conditioning) in
managing their mental health during periods of extreme heat. This focus on clinical perspectives is a critical
innovation of this project, as work on climate change and health is often purely epidemiological in nature and
thus misses opportunities for effective intervention to support the health of climate-affected populations.
Finally, in Aim 3, we will quantify the potential for heterogeneity in the temperature-mental health relationship
using the BEST data. We will focus specifically on important individual indicators of vulnerability (including age,
sex, race/ethnicity, and experiencing homelessness), as well as neighborhood-level features such as air
pollution, the built environment / urban greenspace, and the presence of existing interventions (e.g., cooling
centers) intending to reduce the health impacts of extreme heat in the greater Boston area. The findings from
Aim 3 will complement the qualitative data produced in Aim 2 to provide a fuller understanding of the factors
that contribute to mental health impacts of extreme heat, ranging from social and behavioral to environmental
determinants. Overall, this study will provide crucial information to support this high-risk population in the
context of extreme heat and global climate change.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
Millions of Americans are exposed daily to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) due to the current and
historical use of these chemicals in consumer and industrial products. PFAS exposure in humans is associated
with liver disease and serum hyperlipidemia (increased serum cholesterol, in particular). However, understanding
the mechanism(s) linking PFAS exposure to dyslipidemia is hindered by 1) the ability of PFAS to activate
peroxisome proliferator activated receptor α (PPARα), a receptor activated by fibrate drugs that reduces serum
triacylglycerides, 2) apparently disparate effects of PFAS on serum lipids in human and rodents (in which PFAS
can decrease serum lipids), 3) lack of understanding if/how PFAS congeners exert distinct effects on lipid
homeostasis, and 4) species differences in nuclear receptors that regulate PFAS-induced effects. Our
overarching objective is to determine the mechanisms by which PFAS disrupt systemic lipid homeostasis. Our
research focuses on nuclear receptors that are activated by PFAS and are directly involved in lipid regulation:
PPARα, constitutive androstane receptor (CAR), and pregnane X receptor (PXR). PPARα activation decreases
hepatic and serum lipids while CAR and PXR activation can have the opposite effect. There are two major
chemical classes of PFAS: perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCA) and perfluoroalkyl sulfonic acids (PFSA). We
used a human-relevant model in vitro to show that PFCA and PFSA activate human PPARα (huPPARα) with
differing efficacies. Using mice expressing huPPARα and fed an American diet, we showed that: 1)
perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) activates hepatic huPPARα in vivo at body burdens found in humans, 2) CAR
and PXR also are strongly activated, 3) PFOA increases liver lipids and serum cholesterol, and 4) PFOA’s effects
are sex-dependent. Given the strength of the PFAS-induced CAR/PXR signal, the potential for CAR/PXR to
differentiate the effects of PFCAs and PFSAs, and that CAR/PXR also are activated in a species-specific manner,
we propose that the most human relevant in vivo model should be multi-humanized. Thus, our Specific Aims are
as follows. In Aim 1, we will refine our novel mouse model to investigate human relevant mechanisms of PFAS
action by incorporating human CAR (huCAR) and PXR (huPXR) into the huPPARα mouse and update our novel
“What we eat in America” diet. In Aim 2, we will test the contribution of huPPARα to PFAS-induced toxicological
effects in vivo in the context of huCAR and huPXR by comparing effects in huPPARα+:huCAR+:huPXR+ and
PPARαNull(mouse/human):huCAR+:huPXR+ mice exposed to human-relevant PFAS levels. We will test the hypotheses
that a) activation of PPARα by PFAS limits their capacity to stimulate hepatic steatosis and serum hyperlipidemia
by counteracting effects of CAR/PXR activation and b) PFAS structure will determine the balance of
huPPARα:huCAR/huPXR activation resulting in differences in toxicological effects. Results will fill critical gaps
by generating an in vivo, human-relevant model to investigate PFAS-induced, clinically-relevant disease and
providing novel insights into the mechanisms of action of PFAS in liver and intestine.

A major unmet goal in pulmonary medicine is to distinguish pneumonia sub-phenotypes responsive to host-
directed therapies. We observe that some humans who died with pneumonia have abundant fibrin in their
airspaces while others show little or none, correlating with neutrophils and necrosis. Similarly, some mouse
models of pneumonia result in lungs with abundant airspace fibrin, while others do not; airspace fibrin
associates with both neutrophils and necrosis in these models as well. While fibrin in the airspaces is a
recognized pathological feature of pneumonia, this heterogeneity is not. Because fibrin can be pro-
inflammatory and neutrophils can enhance fibrin accumulation, we propose the central hypothesis that fibrin
and neutrophils in the airspaces form a positive feedback loop that causes damage in a subset of pneumonias.
We will test this by pursuing three independent but mutually informative specific aims. In Aim 1, we will
determine whether fibrin in the airspaces drives neutrophilic pulmonary inflammation and adverse outcomes,
during high-fibrin pneumonia. Using genetic and pharmacologic approaches to interrupt key endogenous
drivers or inhibitors of fibrin accumulation (tissue factor, thrombin, or plasmin), we will test whether loss or gain
of fibrin decreases or increases, respectively, neutrophils and adverse outcomes like necrosis and lung injury
during the high-fibrin but not low-fibrin type of pneumonia in mice. In Aim 2, we will determine whether
neutrophils amplify fibrin accumulation in the airspaces, during high-fibrin pneumonia. We will use gene-
targeted mice to test whether CD11b and neutrophil elastase are each essential for airspace fibrin
accumulation during the high-fibrin but not low-fibrin sub-phenotype of pneumonia. We will also test whether
pharmacologically reducing fibrin or elastase activity when pneumonia is already underway can sever the
proposed positive feedback loop and improve outcomes during the high-fibrin pneumonia in mice. In Aim 3, we
will determine whether high-fibrin pneumonias involve distinctive lung transcriptomes that include a pro-fibrin
signature in airspace cells. We will profile lung transcriptomes of humans who died with high-fibrin vs. low-fibrin
pneumonia, to identify differentially expressed genes and pathways. In mouse models, we will compare lung
transcriptomes over the time-course of lethal high- and low-fibrin pneumonias, to reveal dynamics of changes
as well as consistencies or differences between the human subjects and mouse models. From mouse lungs,
airspace cells (alveolar macrophages, epithelial cells, and neutrophils) will be sorted from high- and low-fibrin
pneumonias to identify cell-specific transcriptome differences between these pneumonia sub-phenotypes. The
proposed studies will help elucidate the mechanisms and significance of high fibrin accumulation in the
airspaces of infected lungs. Results will be informative for whether and which subsets of pneumonia patients
may respond favorably to host-directed therapies targeting fibrin (like anticoagulants and fibrinolytics) and/or
neutrophils (like CD11b blockade or elastase inhibitors).

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
In high income countries, SUDI, and its sub-categories (1) Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) and (2)
Accidental Suffocation Deaths (ASD), are the leading preventable causes of infant mortality. The ensuing ‘back
to sleep’ campaigns have since proven among the most effective public health strategies ever identified for
reducing infant mortality. Yet, in low and middle-income countries (LMICs) almost nothing is known about the
burden of SUDI or its modifiable risk factors, and very few African countries have policies targeting SUDI. In our
recent systematic review, we documented a near absence of research on SUDI in Africa, excepting several well-
conducted investigations from South Africa. Our focus on SUDI emerged during a multi-year postmortem infant
surveillance project to establish the fatal burden of Respiratory Syncytial Virus. Over 3 years, we enrolled ~80%
of all infant deaths in Lusaka, Zambia, nearly 2,300 infants. Ultimately, SUDI was implicated in 7.4% of those
community deaths. Far from being rare, SUDI appeared to be a very common cause of infant demise, with
modifiable risk factors that were ubiquitous yet wholly unaddressed by existing policies in Zambia. If confirmed,
SUDI constitutes a major unmet opportunity to reduce infant mortality in Africa that has largely been ignored by
the global health community. Yet, our early data fall short of the gold standard for evaluating SUDI deaths.
Robust local prevalence data will be essential to support policy initiatives targeting SUDI and as a baseline from
which to judge the impact of such policies. Therefore, we are proposing Project Chisoni, a rigorous 5-year study
to precisely define the burden of SUDI and its modifiable risk factors in Zambia.
To achieve those broader goals, we have convened a multinational multidisciplinary team with expertise in
pediatrics, cause of death analysis, SUDI, pathology, molecular biology, and SUDI epidemiology. Our aims are:
SA1 will create a ‘gold standard’ evaluation of community infant deaths to demonstrate the burden of SUDI in
an African setting, which will include in-depth post-mortem evaluations, multiplex PCR to identify unanticipated
infectious causes of death and detailed death scene investigations to understand the context in which each death
occurred. This will generate the proportion of deaths that are due to SUDI and SUDI deaths/1000 live births.
SA2 includes three sub-aims. SA2.1 will be a matched case-control study examining the association of risk
factors with SUDI among the cases in SA1 vs. a group of contemporaneously enrolled healthy control infants;
SA2.2 takes the ORs and prevalence data from SA1 and S2.1 to calculate the population attributable fraction
(PAF) for risk factors alone or in combination, and therefore the theoretical number of lives that could be saved
through mitigation; and SA2.3 seeks to expand the generalizability of this project by conducting additional risk
factor prevalence surveys in different urban and rural settings in Zambia and several other African nations.

Parasitic infections by Trypanosoma brucei spp. undermine public health and economy in Sub-Saharan Africa.
From the basic science vantage point, discoveries of antigenic variation, trans-splicing, and RNA editing in these
early branching protozoans have contributed fundamental tenets of eukaryotic biology. Notably, work on
mitochondrial U-insertion/deletion mRNA editing introduced the guide RNA concept, a foundation of modern
genome altering technologies. Identification of terminal RNA uridylyltransferases (TUTases) in trypanosomes
has led to recognition of uridylation’s broad significance and diverse cellular roles, ranging from microRNA
turnover in flies to maternal mRNA clearance in mammals. Emerging structural insights establish mitochondrial
U-tailing in T. brucei as the paradigm of RNA processing and decay pathways present in most eukaryotes.
Conversely, the internal U-insertion is a central editing reaction unique to Kinetoplastea. This project will reveal
the mechanisms of TUTase-dependent RNA maturation and editing processes at atomic resolution.
Aim 1 investigates how the TUTase—exonuclease—RNA helicase nexus orchestrates mitochondrial RNA
metabolism. It focuses on protein complexes that couple U-tailing by KRET1 (T1) with degradation, and thereby
govern biogenesis, functionality, and metabolic fates of rRNAs, mRNAs and guide RNAs. Molecular, proteomics,
imaging and cryo-EM approaches will define T1 complexes’ functions, composition, interactomes and structures.
We have identified and will characterize an RNA helicase which links gRNA processing and editing.
Aim 2 examines the structural basis of U-insertion mRNA editing. We have discovered KRET2 (T2) and MEAT1
(M1) and their distinct complexes. By determining in vivo substrates and cryo-EM structures of these assemblies,
we will uncover the mechanisms of editing site selection and U-insertion by divergent T2 and M1 TUTases.

Older Black Americans have higher rates of cognitive impairment and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) than their
White counterparts, a disparity that is greater for Black women. Given the lack of effective therapies to slow
disease progression and symptoms, effective prevention is needed. Most knowledge of risk factors for
cognitive decline, the hallmark feature of AD, comes from studies of White populations and the contribution of
racially/socially-patterned risk factors among Black adults remains under-studied. We propose to study 2,500
Black women ages 55 and older from the Black Women’s Health Study (BWHS), a follow-up study of 59,000
Black women from across the US. Our goal is to identify social factors that, together with biomarkers of AD,
influence cognitive decline. The BWHS provides a unique opportunity to accomplish this goal. Over 27 years,
the BWHS has collected data through biennial questionnaires from participants on socioeconomic,
psychological, and physical stressors occurring at various times of life (e.g., low parental education, childhood
sexual/physical abuse, interpersonal racism), as well as information on many potential risk factors for AD and
cognitive decline (e.g., demographics, body size, behavioral factors (e.g., exercise, diet, smoking), medical
history, reproductive history, medication use, health care). The BWHS has collected and stored blood from a
large subsample of participants who agreed to wide sharing, such as GWAS results with other investigators
and public databases. After enrollment of 2,500 such participants with already-collected blood samples from
the BWHS, we propose to administer a validated telephone cognitive battery annually to measure cognition.
We will also measure a panel of AT(N) plasma biomarkers and conduct GWAS in order to examine the
associations of plasma biomarkers and genetic variants with cognitive decline. Based on the collected data
and the results from biomarker assessments, we will assess the joint effects of the stressors and biomarkers
on cognitive decline. A feasibility study demonstrated the willingness of BWHS participants to complete the
cognitive test battery over the telephone and indicated that enough BWHS participants will participate to reach
a study size of ~2,500 participants. The investigators have the experience and expertise to enroll participants;
measure cognition with a validated telephone cognitive battery; measure AT(N) biomarkers in stored plasma
and conduct GWAS; and with these data, to assess their separate and joint effects on cognitive decline. The
proposed study provides an unparalleled opportunity to leverage a large national sample of older Black women
on which comprehensive data on many factors that affect cognition have been collected to identify life-course
risk factors for cognitive decline. The findings will have important translational implications for efforts to prevent
cognitive decline in all populations, but especially in Black women who are disproportionately burdened.

The goal of this Program Project Grant (PPG) is advancing the latest discoveries in stem cell biology, human
organoid models, and gene editing to understand and treat genetic lung diseases. After a century of basic
sciences advances, culminating in recent Nobel Prize-winning discoveries, such as nuclear reprogramming
and gene editing, biomedical research now faces an inflection point, poised for clinical translation of basic
science successes. While it is hard to envision a more optimistic time in health-related research, treatments for
many devastating lung diseases have not yet been realized, and clinical therapies in most cases still largely
focus on treating symptoms or maintaining life support to allow endogenous lung tissue stem cells enough time
to repair, without available therapies able to interrupt disease-initiating mechanisms or augment the lung’s
capacity to regenerate. Here we address these challenges by proposing an integrated, multi-investigator PPG
to translate lung stem cell research from basic discovery to future clinical applications. An initial focus on
ameliorating genetic lung diseases of the airway and alveoli is pursued, given that their proximal
disease-driving gene mutations are well described. The use induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) carrying
these mutations or their gene-edited progeny is a shared technology harnessed by all Projects together with a
proposed Gene Editing Core, and coordinated by an Administrative Core. Our 4 project leaders have worked
together extensively to develop protocols to differentiate iPSCs into a broad diversity of lung epithelial lineages,
recently optimizing methods to produce the two stem cell populations that maintain all airway and alveolar
epithelia, basal cells and alveolar type 2 cells (AT2s), respectively. Having established these stem cell banks
and protocols, we turn our focus here on applying these resources to advance our mechanistic understanding
of how gene mutations initiate airway and alveolar epithelial dysfunction resulting in disease, and we seek to
therapeutically intervene with novel precision therapeutics or regenerative cell therapies. Towards these
goals, we here propose 4 projects and 2 cores, all interacting to complete shared aims, and synergistic
cross-project experiments. Aim 1 will promote collaborative, integrated cross-project approaches that
produce new human models of genetic airway and alveolar diseases, and will apply these in vitro iPSC and
organoid-based models to understand basic pathogenic mechanisms that lead from epithelial dysfunction to
lung disease. Aim 2 will identify potential therapeutic strategies able to reverse or ameliorate aberrant
pathways responsible for the alveolar dysfunction present in genetic diseases that affect the distal lung,
including proteostasis, mitochondrial dysfunction, and metabolic changes that we hypothesize lead to
reversible epithelial toxic gain-of-function phenotypes. Aim 3 will develop a future approach for treating genetic
lung diseases based on the in vivo reconstitution of airway and alveolar stem cell compartments via
intra-airway transplantation of pluripotent stem cell-derived airway basal or distal alveolar epithelial cells.

Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a debilitating condition with deleterious effects on individuals and
society. Evidence-based treatments for PTSD are available, including cognitive processing therapy (CPT) and
prolonged exposure (PE), but response rates are suboptimal, and dropout rates are high. Patients report
concerns about treatment that prevent optimal response, but evidence suggests therapists are often unaware of
patients' concerns and do not intervene effectively to help their patients benefit from treatment. The purpose of
this research is to refine and test an Adjunctive Writing intervention for Amplifying Response and Engagement
(AWARE), which was developed to enhance outcomes in CPT and PE. AWARE integrates findings from the field
of health communication and uses a writing task and guided therapist responses to facilitate improved patient-
therapist communication about patients’ treatment-related concerns during existing check-ins in CPT and PE.
After iteratively refining AWARE through a case series (n=4), a pilot randomized controlled trial (n=50) will be
conducted to preliminarily compare CPT/PE with AWARE to CPT/PE treatment as usual (TAU). The primary aim
of the RCT is to take an experimental therapeutics approach to demonstrate that AWARE is feasible, acceptable,
and engages the target of improved patient-therapist communication relative to TAU. A preliminary examination
will also be conducted of the effects of 1) AWARE vs. TAU, and 2) variability in patient-therapist communication
on symptom improvement and treatment completion. An exploratory aim is to examine patient-therapist
communication as a mechanism of improved symptom reduction and attendance in AWARE using session-by-
session assessments to see if the putative mechanism precedes and predicts the outcomes. This trial is
consistent with NIMH's Strategy 3.1.A, "Developing novel interventions using a mechanism-informed,
experimental therapeutics approach," and can both enhance outcomes for patients with PTSD and improve the
field's knowledge of processes for enhancing PTSD treatments. Further, given that AWARE is a brief intervention
that can be implemented during existing check-ins in evidence-based treatments, AWARE can be easily scaled
and implemented to enhance outcomes across mental health disorders. The proposed research and training
plans will allow the applicant to gain essential knowledge and applied experience in 1) refining and evaluating a
mechanism-based intervention to enhance PTSD treatments, 2) translating health communication knowledge to
improve PTSD treatment outcomes, 3) using advanced data analyses to examine mechanisms of therapeutic
change, 4) conducting clinical trials in an experimental therapeutics framework, and 5) professional development
and grantsmanship. It will facilitate the applicant's transition to an independent investigator who uses treatment
mechanistic knowledge to optimize PTSD treatment outcomes. This project will take place at the National Center
for PTSD at VA Boston Healthcare System with support from accomplished mentors committed to the applicant's
professional development: Drs. Tara Galovski (primary mentor), Shannon Kehle-Forbes, and Brian Smith.

This K08 Mentored Clinical Scientist Development Award will provide Dr. Kelsey Serier with training to develop
an independent research career devoted to understanding the effect of trauma and trauma-related negative
mental health sequalae, namely posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), on the development and course of type
2 diabetes (T2D). Dr. Serier has assembled an impressive interdisciplinary mentorship team comprised of
experts in trauma, behavioral science, epidemiology, endocrinology, and health informatics to support her
development and successful completion of the proposed training and research goals. Through a
comprehensive and carefully designed training plan, Dr. Serier will address previous training gaps and develop
skills in (1) domain-specific knowledge related to PTSD and T2D, (2) epidemiologic methods and longitudinal
data analysis, and (3) professional development and grant writing. A cross-cutting training goal is furthering her
skills in conducting interdisciplinary team science. The proposed research program leverages the largest
electronic health record cohort of individuals at risk of T2D (n = 6,082,018) in the United States. Data come
from the Veteran’s Health Administration and includes an extensive set of clinician-based diagnoses,
laboratory tests, and up to 15 years of follow-up data. Utilizing this cohort, the current study aims to address
several critical gaps in our current knowledge of PTSD and T2D, specifically: (1) a lack of prospective data that
include clinician-derived diagnostic information, (2) minimal consideration of psychiatric comorbidity, (3) limited
investigation of PTSD on outcomes in individuals with T2D, including glycemic control, and (4) an absence of
studies considering the impact of sex, race, and ethnicity. Aim One will estimate the effect of PTSD,
depression, and their comorbidity on the rate of T2D using cox proportional hazard models and interaction
contrasts. Aim Two will include individuals who developed T2D during the study period (n = 936,596). A series
of conditional logistic regression models and interaction contrasts will be used to estimate the odds of poor
glycemic control in PTSD, depression, and their comorbidity relative to non-psychiatric comparison groups.
Aim Three will examine the extent to which sex, race, and ethnicity modify the associations in Aims One and
Two. The current study includes a large number of women (n = 504,002) and individuals identifying as non-
Hispanic Black (n = 888,465), and Hispanic and Latino (n = 331, 817) to allow for analyses examining the
differential effect of PTSD on T2D in subpopulations with a higher burden of disease. The unique data source
and methodological rigor of the proposed study offers an efficient way to examine the associations between
PTSD and a range of T2D-related outcomes, which will ultimately inform targeted T2D prevention and
intervention approaches. Furthermore, the project will provide the applicant with essential interdisciplinary
training for an independent and integrative research program examining associations between the
psychological sequalae of trauma and T2D.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：SIGNIFICANCE: G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the largest class of membrane proteins in the human
genome and are implicated in a wide array of cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. Notably, GPCRs are the
targets of one third of FDA approved therapeutics, including drugs prescribed for coronary heart disease,
hypertension, and asthma. However, of the ~800 known GPCRs, ~120 are orphan receptors (oGPCRs), which
are considered druggable targets but remain understudied in basic research efforts as they lack a known ligand.
Over the past two decades, extensive efforts to deorphanize oGPCRs have resulted in little turnout. It is evident
there is a need to increase the rate of discovery of ligands for oGPCRs. This proposal outlines a yeast directed
evolution platform for systematic, high-throughput discovery of antibody-based ligands for oGPCRs.
Deorphanizing a single oGPCR alone would open the door to understanding new biology and development of a
potential therapeutic agent.
BACKGROUND: oGPCR deorphanization efforts have been historically slow and low-throughput. Conventional
screens for oGPCR ligands can handle many targets, but due to the sheer amount of possibilities, including
protons, photons, lipids, hormones, peptides, and larger proteins, success has been limited. Nanobodies, or
small antibody fragments, offer distinct advantages for ligand screening, namely their suitability to directed
evolution. Directed evolution allows for billions of nanobodies to be screened for binding and modulation of
oGPCRs with a simple growth selection. Using a yeast-based hypermutation directed evolution platform, and a
precise, scalable, high-throughput continuous culture device, directed evolution campaigns can be scaled up to
ensure a deep search of nanobody sequence space.
SYNOPSIS OF AIMS: In this proposal are two related, but not interdependent aims. AIM1 establishes a
systematic workflow for the functional reconstitution of human GPCRs in yeast, which will (1) create a library of
yeast strains with orphan and non-orphan GPCRs, and (2) elucidate general guidelines to increase success
rates of GPCR expression in yeast. AIM2 takes oGPCRs found to be functional in yeast and uses them to run
directed evolution campaigns to discover nanobody ligands and validate these ligands in human cells. Both aims
can be developed in parallel, with results from AIM1 being progressively integrated into AIM2. Together, these
innovative platforms will lead to the deorphanization of many oGPCRs, thereby enabling the exploration of new
GPCR biology and pharmacology.

The maintenance of cellular and tissue homeostasis relies on the tight regulation of cell growth and proliferation.
This regulation is predominantly controlled by two evolutionarily conserved pathways: the mammalian Target of
Rapamycin (mTOR) pathway and the Hippo pathway. Dysregulation of both the mTOR and Hippo pathways
promotes aberrant cell proliferation, tissue overgrowth and tumor development. Elucidating how the mTOR and
Hippo signaling pathways coordinate their activities is therefore a vitally important, yet poorly understood, area
of cell cancer biology. Our lab previously demonstrated that STK25, a serine/threonine kinase, functions as an
upstream activator of Hippo signaling to limit cell growth. Using unbiased approaches, we have now generated
strong preliminary data suggesting that the STK25 kinase also functions to impair mTORC1 signaling. We have
found that that genetic depletion of STK25 leads to both mTORC1 pathway activation and Hippo pathway
inactivation. These data suggest that STK25 may play a critical role in regulating cell proliferation and tumor
suppression by coordinating the activities of both the mTORC1 and Hippo signaling pathways. However, the
mechanism by which STK25 regulates mTORC1 is unknown. In this proposal, we hypothesize that STK25
directly regulates and phosphorylates key regulatory components of the mTORC1 signaling pathway, ultimately
attenuating mTOR signaling. Further, our preliminary studies of STK25 knockout in mice demonstrate that
conditional depletion of STK25 is sufficient to induce tumorigenesis, which is congruent with bioinformatic
evidence that STK25 is significantly focally deleted in a variety of human cancers. Combining this with our in
vitro findings, we also hypothesize that STK25 deficient tumors are dependent on YAP/TAZ and/or mTORC1
activity for growth and survival. These hypotheses will be tested in two specific aims. In Aim 1, we will use cell
biological and biochemical approaches to mechanistically define the role of STK25 kinase in regulating mTORC1
activity by characterizing its direct phosphorylated substrates. In Aim 2, we will use a conditional STK25 knockout
mouse that we have already generated to determine if STK25 loss facilitates tumorigenesis through increased
YAP/TAZ and/or mTORC1 activity. Successful completion of these aims will advance our understanding of
mTORC1 and Hippo signaling, and reveal significant new insights into the underlying mechanisms driving tumor
development. Moreover, the proposed training plan will greatly enhance my repertoire of skills in microscopy and
imaging techniques, molecular cell biology, mouse cancer studies and liquid chromatography mass spectrometry
(LC-MS/MS) analysis. Altogether, this will facilitate the development of my scientific expertise in the fields of
mTOR and Hippo signaling in cancer biology required for success as an independent scientist.

 Filoviruses are prime examples of zoonotic viruses that cause fulminant hemorrhagic diseases in humans
and nonhuman primates (NHP), resulting in death in up to 90% of human case. The filoviridae family contains
six genera in which several species are known to have high fatality rates, all of which are within
the Marburgvirus or Ebolavirus genera and will therefore be the focus of this proposal. The largest ever 2014
Ebola virus (EBOV) disease outbreak in West Africa underscored the development and regulatory approval of
antiviral countermeasures, including an emergency-use vaccine and therapeutic monoclonal antibodies. While
these countermeasures are highly beneficial to block EBOV infection and interfere with disease progression at
early stages, they are less suitable for the treatment of late-stage EBOV disease (EVD), which is less studied.
Late-stage disease is characterized by gastrointestinal manifestations including diarrhea. At present, no
available animal models, including the classical NHP model, can recapitulate the gastrointestinal symptoms of
EVD patients. To elucidate the role of the intestinal epithelium in disease initiation and progression, we propose
to establish an intestinal filovirus infection model using human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC)-derived
human intestinal organoids (HIOs).
 We hypothesize that infection with EBOV and MARV compromises barrier integrity of the intestinal
epithelium and causes abnormal ion flux as the basis for gastrointestinal dysfunction and diarrhea. This
project proposes the establishment of a polarized 2-dimentional HIO transwell system that will be used to study
the pathophysiological effects of filovirus infection on intestinal epithelial integrity. In Aim 1, we will characterize
filovirus-mediated injury by analyzing (1) intestinal barrier and (2) tight junction integrity. We hypothesize that the
sepsis-like syndrome that occurs in some patients with severe disease may be due to loss of epithelial barrier
integrity in the intestine. In Aim 2, we intend to validate the role of individual genes by genetic ablation and test
potential drug candidates as modulators of intestinal epithelial function. We hypothesize that if tight junctions are
compromised in infected HIOs, then treatment with small molecule inhibitors targeted at ion exchanger would
reverse the leaky junctions by blocking the receptor responsible for the disassemble of the junction. The aims
proposed in this study will result in an improved model which more closely recapitulates in vivo intestinal epithelial
phenotypes, and thus can be used to inform novel therapeutics targeted at late-stage filovirus infection.
 The successful, longstanding mentorship of Drs. Mostoslavsky and Mühlberger, the collaborative support of
the CReM, the availability of the NEIDL research facilities and the rigorous MTM training program will provide
me with the tools and support needed to successfully complete my dissertation work. These departments instill
important values about the rigorous approach to academic science by supporting technical training, writing
workshops and seminar and lecture series.

Frailty is a state of depleted physiologic reserve that is common in older adults. To date there are no proven
therapies to prevent frailty beyond recommendations to adhere to a healthy lifestyle. Frailty is associated with
chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease (CVD), through shared pathophysiology mediated in part by
inflammation. Statins are the mainstay of CVD prevention and have effects beyond lipid lowering, including
reducing inflammation. Yet, many adults aged 75 and older are not taking statins due to a lack of evidence in
this age group. The ongoing PREVENTABLE trial will test the effect of atorvastatin 40mg vs placebo in 20,000
adults aged 75 and older free of CVD for the primary outcomes of survival free of dementia and disability, and
secondarily for incident CVD. However, whether statins can slow frailty has not been previously tested and is
not in the parent trial’s protocol. Thus, the proposed study is critical to establish whether statins may prevent or
slow the progression of frailty. PREVENTABLE provides a unique opportunity to test the effect of statins on
frailty using the two leading prevalent conceptual frameworks for quantifying frailty: the Rockwood cumulative
deficit frailty index (Rockwood FI) and Fried physical phenotype. As part of the parent trial, participants will
have a Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) performed at baseline and assessment of weight loss. A
funded Physical Performance ancillary study will support the administration of the SPPB at annual follow-up in
2500 participants and annual questionnaires will quantify other domains of frailty, including fatigue and physical
activity. The proposed PREVENTABLE Frailty Ancillary Study will complement the main trial by cleaning and
harmonizing EHR, claims, and trial data to calculate a Rockwood FI for all trial participants (n=20,000), and in
the Physical Performance subset (n=2,000), add annual grip strength and weight loss assessments to
complete the Fried phenotype. Finally, an annual blood sample will be collected in the same 2,000 participants
to measure markers of inflammation, neurodegeneration, and other measures to augment the Rockwood FI
with systematically collected routine labs, calculate a lab-FI, and examine Geroscience pathways to determine
the effect of statins on markers of inflammation and biologic aging. The frailty ancillary study will augment the
parent trial and existing ancillary study to determine whether statins: 1) lower the risk of incident frailty defined
according to the Rockwood FI in the entire trial population and Fried physical phenotype in a subset, and 2)
slow the progression of frailty over time according to the Rockwood FI in the entire trial population and Fried
phenotype in a subset. Finally, in the subset with annual blood samples, we will determine the effect of statins
on an FI augmented with labs and a lab-only FI. We will also explore the effect of statins on inflammation and
other hallmarks of aging. Leveraging the infrastructure of the PREVENTABLE trial and its Physical
Performance ancillary study, this timely and cost-effective proposal represents an exceptional opportunity to
test the possibility of statins as a treatment for frailty and biologic aging in a randomized setting.

Mosquito-borne disease is a major source of human misery, sickening hundreds of millions and killing
hundreds of thousands of people annually. The yellow fever mosquito Aedes aegypti is a primary vector for the
viruses that cause dengue, Zika and chikungunya and other diseases. In addition to its medical importance, Ae.
aegypti is increasingly used for molecular genetic studies of mosquito vector biology. Understanding Ae.
aegypti biology will provide basic science insights into this mosquito vector’s development, physiology and
behavior, help inform implementation of control efforts and potentially suggest new control strategies.
Improving approaches for genetic investigations in Ae. aegypti will facilitate these efforts.
 To date, genetic investigations in Ae. aegypti often rely on CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene targeting to
create strains of homozygous mutant animals in which a gene of interest has been disrupted. While extremely
valuable, substantial effort is required to create each mutant and the mutants obtained lack cell-specificity. To
address these limitations, we propose to establish a cell-specific, modified CRISPR/Cas9 (CmC) toolkit for Ae.
aegypti. CmC is designed to decrease the effort required to examine the impact of disrupting a gene of interest,
allow the cells in which a gene is acting to be determined and aid the study of essential genes.
We propose to achieve these goals in two aims:
Aim #1: Introduce the tools for Cell-specific modified CRISPR/Cas9 (CmC) into Ae. aegypti
In aim 1a, we design a strategy and build tools for creating mosquito strains that express modified Cas9
transgenes designed to allow optimization of Cas9 levels. In aim 1a2, we use these tools to create mosquitoes
that express modified Cas9 transgenes in a specific subset of sensory neurons. In aim 1b, we create transgenes
that express multiple gRNAs in a cell-specific fashion to specify the genes targeted.
Aim 2: Implement CmC in a subset of sensory neurons as well as pan-neuronally
In aim 2a, we test the system, using the tools built to identify an optimal strain which promotes robust cell-
specific gene disruption in a subset of sensory neurons, without causing cell death. In aim 2b, we construct
mosquito strains that will enable broad neuron-specific gene disruption, which should be of wide utility.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
Control of RNA metabolism is emerging as a major hub for regulation in the brain. Therefore, it is not
surprising that there is a strong link between perturbation of RNA metabolism and a number of neurological
and neurodegenerative diseases. These include Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) in which Tau protein and Aß42
fragments have been shown to interact and/or modulate directly or indirectly RNA binding proteins and RNA
metabolism in general. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are highly abundant RNAs produced by circularization of
specific exons. Interestingly, circRNAs accumulate in an age-dependent manner in neural tissues suggesting
their relevance to age-related homeostasis and/or pathogenesis. Indeed, specific circRNAs accumulate in
the brains of individuals with Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s diseases. However, how these circRNAs are
involved in the pathogenesis of those and other neurodegenerative diseases is largely unknown.
We recently developed systems to down- or up-regulate circRNAs in Drosophila. Using these tools, we
demonstrated the functionality of these molecules in vivo. We generated a resource to knock down (KD) the
110 more abundant circRNAs and found that KD of particular circRNAs results in different brain-related
phenotypes. Interestingly, we identified 35 circRNAs that when knocked down alter lifespan. Further data
shows that expression of some circRNAs is toxic for the aging fly, with links to aging and potentially
neurodegeneration. In addition, we found that KD of some circRNAs lead to specific behavioral and motor
defects, many of which are age-dependent. In addition, we observed changes in the levels of circRNAs in
Drosophila models of AD or other neurogenerative diseases. Here we aim to uncover the functions and
mechanisms of action of circRNAs during AD. To do so, we will use Drosophila AD models and perform a
genomic screening to determine if modulation of individual circRNAs can alter the progression and outcome
of the disease. Moreover, we will also test potential mechanisms by which circRNAs could alter AD including
nucleation of aggregates, altering mitochondrial function, autophagy, apoptosis, and/or inflammation.
In sum, the present proposal will reveal new roles of circRNAs during AD. As we will perform the
experiments in a system that has high and functional levels of circRNAs (the fly CNS) the present results will
be meaningful and could be later extended to mammalian models. We are aware of the limitations of the AD
fly models but this is the only system in which the full extent of interaction with a large number of circRNAs
can be assessed. Moreover, as we have already found that some circRNAs alter aging, the chances of
success are high. This will be a pioneering work in this new and important area of research and we are
confident that our findings will open a new pathway for studying the roles of circRNAs in AD. Our project
builds on exciting preliminary results and the unique and constantly evolving expertise of our group.

Transcription dominates the gene expression landscape of circadian rhythms and a number of neuroscience
areas. Yet post-transcriptional regulation, including translational regulation and the role of RNA binding
proteins (RBPs), has become increasingly recognized as important in recent years. Moreover, understanding
the roles of RBPs in diverse cell types and diseases and ultimately therapeutic intervention requires identifying
the RNA targets of RBPs. The ribosome can be considered a RBP, so this focus on post-transcriptional
regulation and RBP targets includes identifying ribosome-associated transcripts, namely RNAs that change
their translational status under defined circumstances. RBP identification is particularly challenging from small
numbers of cells, e.g., cancer stem cells within a large, heterogeneous solid tumor or discrete neuronal
subtypes. These settings preclude traditional biochemistry and therefore require new approaches. Two new
methods recently appeared, TRIBE and STAMP, which exploit the RNA editing enzymes ADAR and APOBEC,
respectively. Their ribosome versions, Ribo-STAMP and Ribo-TRIBE, are even more recent and fuse a
ribosomal protein to the editing enzymes. This is so that the enzyme will be near RNAs that are being
translated and will “mark” them by changing their sequence. These edits are identified by mRNA sequencing
and straightforward computational methods, even from single cells. We propose to compare Ribo-STAMP and
Ribo-TRIBE side-by-side in mammalian cell culture systems, to assess their efficacy and to determine the
optimal configuration of ribosome-editing enzyme fusions. We also propose to develop Ribo-TRIBE for use in
Drosophila; we recently discovered that STAMP does not work in this organism, which limits us to TRIBE. We
will then extend these methods to the more biological context of neurons, from Drosophila as well as from
mouse brains. To complement these efforts, we will develop an extension of the TRIBE/STAMP theme called
Nanobody-editing. It consists of fusing the editing enzyme, ADAR or APOBEC, to a GFP-nanobody, which will
then deliver the editing enzyme to any GFP-tagged RNA binding protein or GFP-tagged ribosome. The
chimeric, recombinant protein will be used in vitro as a recombinant protein or expressed in vivo. Nanobody-
editing will facilitate identifying RBP and ribosome targets, because already existing GFP-tagged RBP or
ribosomes can serve as substrates. Moreover, in vitro editing will in many cases obviate the need to generate
new transgenes and transgenic animals. Lastly, TRIBE and as well as Ribo-TRIBE will be used to characterize
translational regulation “around the clock” within a few key Drosophila circadian neurons. These efforts will
deepen our understanding of circadian gene expression regulation as well as provide the community with new
tools with which to study translation in important but challenging biological systems.

Neurons have classically been defined by the neurotransmitter they release. This “identity” has
been considered to be both singular (i.e. one transmitter) and immutable (i.e. genetically
hardwired). While the astonishing prevalence of cotransmission has changed thinking about the
singularity of neurotransmitter identity there has been considerably less appreciation of the
ability of neurons to exhibit plasticity in their expression. Recently, we discovered that the
microRNA miR-190 is a potent regulator of adult sleep. Spatial and temporal mapping of its site
of action demonstrates that it is required during pupation in a population of cells that transcribes
both cholinergic and glutamatergic genes but differentiates to become a small subset of the
adult glutamatergic neurons. This subset includes components of the core sleep homeostasis
circuit. We will test the hypothesis that a neurotransmitter plasticity event is critical to function of
the mature circuit and that it provides a novel mechanism for establishing, and potentially
modifying, the sleep set-point of the homeostatic machinery.
Aim 1 will determine the role of neurotransmitter plasticity in the control of adult sleep, with a
focus on understanding the circuit-level changes.
Aim 2 will investigate the role of neuronal activity in transmitter switching and homeostat
plasticity, with a focus on understanding the molecular events.
In this proposal, we bring the power of Drosophila genetics to bear on this novel and important
type of plasticity. We demonstrate that programmed transmitter plasticity during pupal life is
crucial to adult function of the sleep circuitry. The genetic reagents we have developed will allow
us to address basic mechanisms underlying transmitter plasticity in the context of both the
developing and mature nervous systems and, for the first time, link this type of plasticity to
sleep.

The goal of this proposal is to understand how cellular membrane trafficking machinery controls the packaging
and release of extracellular vesicle (EV) cargoes from synapses in vivo. EVs are small membrane-bound
vesicles released by numerous cell types, including neurons, carrying cargoes critical for signaling and
disease. However, we understand very little about how EV cargo traffic is spatially and temporally regulated
within the polarized and complex morphology of neurons. We have developed tools to track and manipulate EV
traffic at Drosophila presynaptic terminals in vivo, and discovered that flux of cargoes through a plasma
membrane-recycling endosome route determines whether they are locally sorted for packaging and release in
EVs, rather than depleted from synapses by retrograde transport. Recycling endosomes have primarily been
studied in non-neuronal cells, and very little is known about their lifetime, functions, or dynamics at presynaptic
terminals. We do know that recycling endosomes play critical roles in signaling, neuronal morphogenesis, EV
traffic, and synaptic transmission. Understanding and therapeutically intervening in these important processes
will require a deeper knowledge of the mechanisms of neuronal recycling endosome function. In this proposal,
we will elucidate the mechanisms of synaptic EV cargo and recycling endosome traffic in vivo. To achieve
these goals, we will use Drosophila genetics, biochemistry, high-resolution microscopy, and live cell imaging.
1) We will determine the functions, dynamics, and regulation of different types of synaptic recycling
endosomes. To this end, we will develop new tools and approaches to define and control functionally distinct
recycling compartments at synapses. Using these tools, we will test novel mechanistic hypotheses for how
membrane traffic machinery sorts cargoes at synaptic recycling compartments. 2) We will determine how EV
cargo traffic depends on distinct modes of synaptic endocytosis: clathrin-mediated endocytosis, which operates
under low neuronal activity and activity-dependent bulk endocytosis, which operates during intense neuronal
activity. These experiments will ascertain if EV fate is determined by different modes of internalization, how
recycling endosomes contribute to these functions, and provide new mechanisms to link activity, endosomal
traffic, and EV release. Given the conserved nature of synaptic membrane trafficking machinery, our findings
and tools will lay the foundation for new insights into EV traffic in many aspects of nervous system function,
including in human neurological disease.

The hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex (PFC) are both critical for learning and memory-guided behavior.
Coordination of neural activity between these regions is necessary for memory and cognitive processes,
however, the nature of these interactions and their roles are still unclear. We have established multiple timescale
neural representations in these regions for spatial learning and memory-guided behavior, with inter-regional
coordination during spatial firing and theta oscillations in exploratory behavior, and during sharp-wave ripple
(SWR) associated replay in sleep and awake immobility periods. Here, we will investigate the roles of these
physiological network patterns in learning and memory-guided navigation by combining behavioral methods in
rats, high-density recordings, and causal manipulation methods. (Aim 1) The influence of reward on mnemonic
representations is key to understanding the role of hippocampal-prefrontal activity patterns in memory-guided
behavior. In particular, it is known that reward changes influence hippocampal replay, and replay is thought to
play a role in linking actions to reward for reinforcement learning. To address this question directly, we have
developed methods in TH-Cre rats for optogenetic tagging and identification of dopaminergic ventral tegmental
area (VTA) neurons which encode reward prediction error, simultaneously with recordings from hippocampal
and prefrontal ensembles. We will record and manipulate VTA dopamine neuron firing to examine the influence
on replay and task representations in the hippocampal-prefrontal network during learning of new spatial rules.
(Aim 2) The hippocampus and prefrontal cortex are both known to be important for contextual encoding and
generalizing experiences across contexts, but the mechanisms are unclear. Our preliminary data show rule-
selective encoding by prefrontal neurons that is maintained across spatial contexts, whereas hippocampal CA1
neurons remap across contexts. Further, we have also found coordinated hippocampal-prefrontal ripples vs
independent cortical ripples with distinct reactivation patterns. We will examine whether hippocampal-prefrontal
ensembles underlie rule representations and contextual encoding, whether theta sequences maintain encoding
of current context, and test the hypothesis that replay during coordinated ripples enables associations across
contexts. (Aim 3) Goal representations are considered central to navigation, but the mechanisms for goal coding
and hippocampal-prefrontal representations for memory-guided navigation are still unclear. Our preliminary data
using a complex 2-d maze with flexible goal locations and barriers supports goal representations and replay by
hippocampal and prefrontal ensembles during navigation. We will test the hypotheses that hippocampal and
prefrontal replay events during immobility support planning of upcoming trajectories, and goal representations
impact theta sequences for online maintenance during trajectory execution. Overall, our results will provide novel
insight into fundamental learning and memory mechanisms that are affected in aging and memory disorders
such as Alzheimer’s disease.

 Despite the progress in molecular therapy and immunotherapy, multiple underlying cellular mechanisms
cause resistance to cancer therapy. There are urgent needs to develop innovative approaches to meet these
challenges. The proposed study is to develop subcellular enzyme-instructed self-assembly (sEISA), which
includes mitochondrial EISA (mitoEISA) and cytoplasmic EISA (cytoEISA), for generating molecular nanofibers
to overcome drug resistance and immunosuppression in cancer therapy. Our preliminary studies have shown
that sEISA selectively targets the mitochondria of cancer cells and minimizes drug resistance. Most importantly,
our preliminary study shows that sEISA inhibits the growth of immunosuppressive tumors in vivo. Thus, we
propose to further develop sEISA against drug resistant cancer cells and tumors. The proposed research has
three specific aims: Aim 1, developing mitoEISA for selectively targeting cancer cells; Aim 2, developing
cytoEISA for minimizing drug resistance and immunosuppression; and Aim 3, evaluating sEISA in ovarian
cancer xenograft murine models. The central hypothesis is that sEISA spatiotemporally generates molecular
nanofibers, which interact with multiple cellular proteins and interrupt multiple cellular processes inside cancer
cells to minimize drug resistance. Our preliminary results support the central hypothesis. The innovation is that
the mechanisms of the action of the molecular nanofibers significantly depart from the ligand-receptor dogma of
the current anticancer drugs. The long-term goal of the proposed work is to develop sEISA to generate molecular
nanofibers for overcoming resistance in cancer therapy. We anticipate that this research will provide innovative
anticancer approaches to address the problems of drug resistance and immunosuppression in cancer therapy,
thus ultimately will improve the survivorship of cancer patients.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Black Americans demonstrably suffer from a range of health disparities rising from a long history of
structural inequities and racism. Although Black Americans are slightly less likely to drink alcohol than the
general population, the rate of Black drinkers with alcohol use disorders (AUD) is comparable, representing 1.5
million Black Americans with AUD. Blacks suffer more negative consequences due to alcohol use such as
illnesses, injuries, criminal-legal involvement, and social problems. Recovery is a dynamic process of behavior
change leading to stable improvements in functioning, purpose and well-being. NIAAA further highlights
recovery as remission from AUD symptoms as well as cessation of heavy drinking. Recovery support services
and recovery community organizations aim to build recovery capital. Yet, to date little effort has been made to
consider recovery within population groups rather than across groups. A “centering in the margins” approach
emphasizes the need to examine experiences of racialized and minoritized populations. This proposed study to
advance recovery pathways and support services for Black men and women heeds that call. It is directly
responsive to RFA-AA-21-001 in its emphasis on health disparities in AUD populations, intersecting with the
RFA goals to advance culturally-informed measures and interventions, increase access to AUD services, make
services more appealing, and evaluate evidence-based practices. We do this with a focus on Black men and
women in AUD recovery. We thus aim to iteratively use quantitative and qualitative methods to capture and
assess questions related to AUD recovery in a heterogenous Black population, in partnership with a Black-
majority recovery community organization in Detroit. Specifically: (1) Use qualitative methods with a Black
population to (a) define AUD recovery pathways; (b) assess and refine a measure of recovery domains (e.g.,
relationships, living environment); and (c) identify and map community indicators that may facilitate or interfere
with AUD recovery. (2) Use quantitative methods to describe and assess the provision of AUD recovery
support services provided by the recovery community organization in terms of matching to needs, stage of
recovery and other client and community characteristics, by race/ethnicity. (3) Conduct a pragmatic
randomized controlled trial that builds on Aims 1 and 2 with a Black AUD recovery population, compared to a
treatment as usual group with in-person recovery support services, to determine the effectiveness of an added
phone+digital recovery support service intervention (i.e., provision of smartphones and guidance/support for
online recovery activities). The proposed study will enable a deep understanding of what recovery means to
Black men and women, how it can be measured, and how we can advance recovery journeys of Black
Americans with AUD. The results will be meaningful to Black individuals themselves, providers who treat
Blacks who have AUD, and to researchers and policymakers who need to better understand the meaning and
needs of a heterogenous US population.

 It is essential for the fate of an organism that key morphogenetic processes occur reproducibly even
under tissue damage or environmental perturbations. While much is known about how genetic redundancy and
regulation achieves robust development, less is understood about how a tissue mechanically ensures
reproducible shape change when perturbed. This project uncovers how populations of physically interacting
cells mechanically respond to challenging conditions and modify their collective behavior to still sculpt the
correct final shape.
 One way for cells to coordinate tissue-scale forces and movements is through direct mechanical
connections. In fact, many developing tissues exhibit supracellular networks of actomyosin connections that
link hundreds of cells. A large roadblock has been with the challenges of imaging and quantifying subcellular
protein at the tissue scale. I adapted a topological smoothing algorithm originally used to trace high-noise
filamentous structure of galaxies in the Universe to data to trace high-noise filamentous myosin structure in
confocal images. This allowed for the first quantification of a supracellular myosin network across an entire
tissue over developmental time. Subsequent analysis adopting techniques from network theory allowed me to
identify that the robust folding of the Drosophila fruit fly embryo during ventral furrow formation is mechanically
ensured by patterns in the supracellular network spanning its ventral cells.
 This newly discovered importance of supracellular networks in coordinating robust shape change
highlights the need for a comprehensive understanding of how supracellular networks form, and how their
patterns impact the function and robustness of a population of cells. Deciphering robustness at the tissue-level,
where the displacement and fate of hundreds of cells must be considered, requires techniques at the interface
of cell and developmental biology, biophysics and computer science. The proposed project will take a highly
interdisciplinary approach to identify how supracellular network patterns are controlled molecularly, at the cell
level, and via tissue constraints. As well, how heterogeneity in tissue-level patterns impacts morphogenetic
robustness will be addressed. Together this comprehensive study of the structure and function of supracellular
networks will represent a new way to interpret mechanical robustness across diverse developing tissues. As
well, a generalized description of mechanical robustness has the potential to uncover new paths to predict and
control tissue malformation, which would represent a significant advance for both developmental biology and
fetal medicine.

We like to think of taste as working relatively simply—a sweet taste is recognized as sweet by
virtue of activating certain cells on the tongue, and that information is used to drive neurons that
cause us to eat more of whatever food is in our mouths. The truth, however, is much more
interesting: a taste hits the tongue, and complex circuits in the brain go into action, passing
food-related information back and forth as the system as a whole decides whether the morsel is
palatable enough to swallow. My lab studies this process by recording from multiple parts of the
taste system while active rats are sampling various tastes. We have observed this decision-
making process in action in taste cortex, where neural ensembles report, in turn, that a taste is
on the tongue, that the taste is (say) sugar, and that it (the rat) currently likes the taste; this last
step appears to be one arrived at suddenly, in a moment of insight—the food rolls around in the
rat’s mouth for 0.5-1.5 seconds, and then the decision is made. This process clearly involves
and requires cortex, but it is just as clear that cortex doesn’t work alone. Here, we will do
rigorous tests of where that information in cortex comes from (specifically examining the roles
played by amygdala and hypothalamus), in the process revealing novel systems-level
mechanisms of taste processing. As a whole, this research project has the potential to
completely change the way we think about taste, and to usher in new thinking about perception
in general—thinking that makes a great deal more biological sense, given the complexity of
brain circuitry.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
Regulation of RNA metabolism is emerging as a major regulatory hub for gene expression control in tissues
like the brain and the muscle, which don’t undergo cell division. Therefore, it is not surprising that there is a
strong link between perturbation of RNA metabolism and a number of muscular and neurodegenerative
diseases including myotonic dystrophy (MD) and amyotrophic lateral dystrophy (ALS). For example, MD- 1
is provoked by the sequestration of the splicing factor MBNL1 encoded by the gene muscleblind-1. MBNL1
and another member of the MBL family (MBNL2) have important and overlapping functions in RNA
processing and transport, in particular in muscle and neurons.
Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a highly abundant, not well-characterized type of non-coding RNA. These
RNAs are generated by circularization of specific exons, and their functionality is still controversial. Recent
work from my laboratory has demonstrated that circRNA production competes with pre-mRNA splicing,
suggesting that circRNAs are general cis regulators of gene expression. We found by studying of MBL, the
Drosophila homolog of MBNL1, that this protein regulates the production of a subset of circRNAs, including
one generated from its own locus (circMbl). Work from the previous period demonstrated that circRNAs
generated from the mbl locus regulate gene expression, physiology and behavior. We found that these
circRNAs act in cis and are part of a self-regulatory loop that limits MBL expression. In addition, we found
that circMbl has functions in trans as knockdown (KD) of circMbl provokes several developmental,
physiological and behavioral phenotypes which are distinct but related to the ones observed upon MBL KD.
Together, our data demonstrates that circMbl and MBL work in related pathways but have distinct functions.
Here we aim to unravel the molecular and physiological implications of circMbl production and
function. This work will result in pioneering functional characterization of circRNAs in vivo and will be key for
understanding how MBL production and function are regulated in vivo. For doing so we will: identify MBL-
dependent and MBL-independent mechanisms of action of circMbl. We will follow by determining the
physiological and neural roles of mbl and circMbl isoforms. This project will illuminate essential
regulatory mechanisms of mbl expression and function. As or more importantly, this project is both technically
and intellectually innovative in its analysis of the roles of circRNAs in central aspects of physiology, and
behavior. Our project builds on strong preliminary results and the unique and constantly evolving expertise
of our group.

This proposal aims to determine how the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is regulated in neurons at rest and during
neuronal activity. The ER is a contiguous membrane-bound compartment, which forms a network of tubules that
extends to the periphery of neurons and forms contacts with other organelles, controlling processes such as lipid
transfer, organelle scission, and calcium signaling. Patients with neurodegenerative disorders, such as
Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia (HSP), often have mutations in genes that disrupt ER structure and ER contacts.
However, our understanding of ER function in neurons primarily comes from studies of non-neuronal cells. The
complex morphologies and elongated structures of neurons impose unique challenges for secretory and
endosomal membrane trafficking pathways. In particular, endosomes are vital for conveying long-distance
signals within neurons and packaging cargoes for intercellular signaling through extracellular vesicles. We
currently know very little about how ER contacts regulate neuronal endosomal compartments, or how the
structure of the neuronal ER is modified by activity. This project will use Drosophila and mammalian neuronal
systems to examine ER-endosome contacts in neurons and to study how neuronal activity regulates the ER.
The Drosophila neuromuscular junction is an excellent system to study the ER because it is genetically tractable,
and easily accessible for live imaging and electrophysiology. On the other hand, mammalian neuronal cultures
provide homogeneous material for biochemical studies, and can show if findings in Drosophila are evolutionarily
conserved. First, this proposal will determine how the HSP-linked gene Atlastin, which controls the assembly of
the ER into a reticular network, affects ER-endosome contacts in Drosophila and mammalian neurons (Aim1a,c).
Atlastin mutant synapses will be examined to uncover the mechanistic basis of the observed structural and
dynamic defects in the ER, as well as the accumulation of endosomal and extracellular vesicle cargoes (Aim1b).
Next, this study will examine how different neuronal activity paradigms (e.g. spontaneous vs. mild vs strong
stimulation) regulate the dynamics of the ER and ER-endosome contacts in Drosophila (Aim2a). Finally,
proximity labeling approaches will also be used in hippocampal neurons to identify candidate proteins at ER
contacts that are regulated by neuronal activity, to lay the foundation for future functional studies in Drosophila
(Aim2b). To achieve these research goals, the proposed training plan will expand the PI’s experimental skillsets
in various microscopy techniques, construction of genetic sensors, mammalian neuronal culture, and new coding
skills for image analysis such as image restoration and particle tracking. The career development plan focuses
on strengthening the PI's publication record, transitioning to an independent research position, and promoting
diversity, equity, and inclusion in science. Overall, the MOSAIC K99/R00 will allow the PI to gain necessary skills
to become an independent researcher in the field of neuronal cell biology and membrane trafficking.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Respiratory viral pathogens have been responsible for major pandemics over the past two centuries with
extraordinary human and economic cost. While most vaccines have focused on antibody neutralization of
virus, there has been growing interest in targeting CD8 T cell immunity for more durable protective immune
memory. Specifically, there has been interest in vaccines that generate tissue resident memory T cells (TRM),
but one issue complicating this approach is the observed lack of durability of lung TRM, whether generated by
pulmonary viral infection or targeted vaccination. Unlike TRM in other tissues, which accumulate and survive for
years, lung TRM have half-lives measured in days. We have discovered an alternative population of CD8 TM that
can mediate lung-focused T cell memory and protection from morbidity and mortality after skin vaccination.
The durability of this immunity appears to be provided by a unique population of lung tropic CD8 T cells
concentrated in the intravascular space of the lung (rather than the parenchyma). Using IAV as a model viral
respiratory pathogen, these CD8 T cells appear to rapidly extravasate and enter lung parenchyma within hours
after infection, providing a rapid on demand protective memory response with kinetics comparable to lung TRM.
Their activity does not require CD4 T cells, and elimination of these CD8 TM cells completely abrogates robust
vaccine protection. Analysis of these cells by scRNAseq reveals that they have circulatory markers, but also
immediate-early genes reminiscent of skin TRM generated from the same vaccination. They are transcriptionally
distinct from spleen TEM and LN TCM generated by the same vaccination and appear to be robust >6 months
later. Most importantly, they provide complete protection from morbidity and mortality from viral lung challenge
and function independently of antibodies and B cells. Using defined genetic models, scRNA seq, ATACseq,
multidimensional flow cytometry, and lung intravital microscopy, we will test key hypotheses about the mode of
generation, in vivo biological behavior, and protective immunity of these cells. We have assembled expert
collaborators in each of these areas to fully explore the biology of these cells and the potential of generating
these cells by epidermal disruption (ed) vaccination. We believe that these TM cells are an important and
unstudied component of normal T cell memory designed to provide superior and long-lasting lung immunity
without occupying valuable lung parenchymal space. We believe that optimized generation of these cells by
improved vaccination approaches will provide a superior way to combat respiratory viral pathogens.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:
Recent FDA accelerated approvals of two anti-amyloid antibody treatments, aducanumab and lecanemab, for
early-stage Alzheimer’s disease (AD) provide the first disease-modifying treatments to date, albeit with moderate
slowing of cognitive decline, and vascular side effects known as Amyloid Related Imaging Abnormalities due to
edema (ARIA-E) or microhemorrhages (ARIA-H) in ~12-35% of patients, especially ApoE4 carriers. While the
cause of ARIA is unknown, it has been suggested that Ab clearance by anti-amyloid antibodies is mediated by
perivascular drainage which may transiently lead to amyloid accumulating in the blood vessel wall and inducing
inflammation, which in turn may increase BBB breakdown, leading to edema or microhemorrhages (Cogswell et
al., 2022). Therefore, there is still a large unmet need to improve cognitive efficacy and safety of anti-amyloid
immunotherapy. Semaglutide is a Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor (GLP-1R) agonist, that is FDA approved
for the treatment of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and obesity, that has strong anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective and
pro-vascular health effects. Previous studies have shown beneficial effects of semaglutide in stroke models,
diabetes models, LPS models and other disease models. Novo Nordisk, the inventor of semaglutide, is
conducting two large Phase 3a clinical trials to test the efficacy of semaglutide in early-stage AD (EVOKE,
EVOKE+). While other GLP-1R agonists have shown benefits in AD mouse models, semaglutide, a longer lasting
form, has not yet been tested in amyloid AD mouse models. The goal of this project is to determine whether the
combination of semaglutide with anti-amyloid antibody therapy will enhance the efficacy beyond that of either
treatment alone and attenuate the vascular side effects seen with anti-amyloid antibodies. We propose the
following 3 Aims: 1. We hypothesize that semaglutide alone will reduce or reverse inflammation and
neurodegeneration and spare cognition in 2 amyloid AD-like mouse models: 5XE4 mice which overexpress
human mutant APP/PS1 on a human ApoE4/4 background and APPSAA knockin mice which express physiologic
levels of human mutant APP. Mice will be dosed for 12 weeks at 2 ages – pre-plaque and after robust plaque
and vascular amyloid accumulation. 2. We hypothesize that combination therapy with semaglutide and anti-
amyloid antibodies (murine versions of lecanemab and donanemab) will enhance efficacy compared to either
treatment alone in the 5XE4 model which develops abundant plaques, vascular amyloid, inflammation and
cognitive decline with aging. 3. We hypothesize that acute semaglutide co-treatment with a murine precursor to
bapineuzumab (3D6) shown to cause a high amount of ARIA, will mitigate microhemorrhagic side effects in aged
5XE4 mice. Outcomes include behavioral testing, pathological and biochemical measures, bulk RNAseq and in-
depth analysis of transcriptomic changes within cell populations in cortex and hippocampus, and mapping of the
mouse data to human data available on the NIH-sponsored AMP-AD portal. If successful, combination trials in
humans could be initiated to improve the efficacy and safety of anti-amyloid antibody immunotherapy.

 Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the most common cause of dementia, is accompanied by progressive
neurodegeneration and stereotypic deposition of misfolded amyloid β- (Aβ) and tau proteins. However, the
basis for cellular dysfunction in AD is not well understood, underscoring an important need to broaden the
biologic scope of AD research. Technological advances, based on single-cell whole-genome sequencing
(scWGS) on frozen postmortem human brain tissue, now allow examination of previously inaccessible aspects
of the genome of individual cells in the brain. Recent research from our group has found that neurons in
individuals with AD show greater somatic single-nucleotide variants (sSNV) in their genomes than in
individuals without AD. Using mutational signature analysis, our study also found that the specific causes of
somatic mutations differed in AD, implicating oxidative stress and signal suggesting other cytopathologic
events.
 This study aims to understand neuronal somatic mutation in AD at a deeper level, to probe how disease
progression and protein misfolding impact the burden and signatures of sSNV. The first aim will examine
neurons from individuals with different pathologic stages of AD. This will give us a better understanding of
when somatic mutations develop in disease, and whether certain mutagenic events occur with distinct timing in
the development of AD. The second aim will study how intracellular tau pathology relates to somatic mutation,
utilizing a novel method to separate individual nuclei according to tau tangle formation. In applying this method
to specific brain regions at specific pathologic stages at the forefront of AD progression, we will be able to
determine if somatic mutation is tied to tau pathology at the level of individual cells. In the final aim, we will test
whether Aβ trigger somatic mutation, using a human iPSC-derived neuronal cellular model and incubation with
human brain-derived Aβ oligomers.
 With complementary approaches of novel scWGS technology, single-nucleus sorting, and specific human
tissues and and cellular systems, we will examine the mechanistic role of neuronal somatic mutations in AD.
This examination of the interplay between disease progression, protein misfolding, and the landscape of
somatic mutations will be an important step in understanding the molecular causes of AD. Moreover, the
capability of somatic mutational signature analysis to reveal previously unrecognized disease mechanisms
lends additional promise toward development of better treatments and cures.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
 The overall goal of this proposal is to systematically characterize the cellular functions of
transcription factor isoforms. Transcription factors (TFs) are master regulators of gene expression and as
such play key roles in a variety of biological processes, including cell growth and differentiation. The human
genome is estimated to harbor ~1600 TF genes; however, most of these are expressed as a series of protein
isoforms arising from mRNAs with alternative starts, ends, or splicing. Though a handful of alternative TF
isoforms are known to play functionally important (and distinct) roles in the cell, the overwhelming majority—
thousands of proteins—remain entirely uncharacterized. Moreover, splicing aberrations are a hallmark of
cancer, and mis-expression of TF isoforms can contribute to tumorigenesis. Thus, decoding the roles of TF
isoforms is key to a systems-level understanding of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) in development and
disease. In my previous work, I found widespread changes in DNA binding, protein-protein interactions, and
transcriptional activation in exogenous assays across a collection of >700 TF isoforms. These results
underscore the need to perturb and characterize TF isoforms in their endogenous cellular context to truly
understand their roles in GRNs.
 Functional genomics approaches such as high throughput perturbation screens have revolutionized our
understanding of gene functions. I aim to apply and extend these functional genomics approaches to
study isoforms, which have remained elusive due to technical limitations. I propose to use a combination of
state-of-the-art genomic technologies to decode the functions of TF isoforms in breast cancer cells. I will
leverage long read RNA-sequencing to perform rigorous isoform-aware analyses (Aim 1) and isoform-specific
high throughput experiments (Aims 2 and 3). In Aim 1, I will re-analyze existing CRISPR/Cas9 knock-out
databases from the Cancer Dependency Map Consortium to identify candidate isoform-specific phenotypes in
breast cancer. In Aim 2, I will establish a platform for robust and specific knock-down of individual isoforms in
mammalian cells using RNA-targeting CRISPR/Cas systems. In Aim 3, I will use tunable libraries of TF ORFs
to quantitatively tune isoform expression across a range of physiological levels. The proposed work includes
technology development in the mentored K99 phase, which I will then leverage during the independent R00
phase to probe the mechanisms of TF isoform function in breast cancer via single-cell screening approaches.
 Successful execution of these aims will begin to decode the “dark matter” of alternative TF isoforms,
laying a foundation for future studies of alternative isoforms more broadly. By combining new training in high-
throughput screening approaches during the K99 phase with my existing expertise in gene regulation, TF
biology, and bioinformatics, this transition to independence award will position me well to start my own
research group that uses interdisciplinary genomic methods to probe GRNs in development and disease.

The long-term objective of this project is to develop Dr. Romanos-Nanclares’s capacity to conduct studies that
integrate dietary and lifestyle factors with multi-omics data and traditional biomarkers to better understand the
biological pathways underlying the etiology of aggressive forms of breast cancer and to advance the field of
precision nutrition for cancer prevention. The proposed research combines ‘omics methodologies with advanced
statistical techniques to investigate the role of chronic inflammation in the etiology of breast cancer. Chronic
inflammation has been identified as a possible risk factor in the development of breast cancer, including estrogen
receptor negative breast cancer, which is a subtype of breast cancer that is associated with poorer prognosis
and is less responsive to hormonal therapies. The foundation for this proposal is based on our recent findings
where a higher adherence to an Empirical Dietary Inflammatory Pattern (EDIP) score (or a more pro-
inflammatory diet) was associated with increased breast cancer risk, particularly for tumors lacking estrogen
receptor expression. Leveraging the unique design and wealth of resources in the Nurses’ Health Study (NHS)
and Nurses’ Health Study II (NHSII), with repeated dietary measures and prediagnostic plasma specimens, this
application will combine dietary and ‘omics data from multiple biological dimensions with cutting-edge
epidemiological and bioinformatics methodologies to examine the relationship between chronic inflammation and
invasive breast cancer risk and estrogen receptor subtypes. In Aim 1 (K99), she will examine the associations
of plasma metabolomic profiles of EDIP with subsequent risk of breast cancer in the NHS and NHSII among
1,997 cases and their matched controls. In Aim 2 (R00), she will use an agnostic approach to identify the
associations of plasma proteomics with risk of breast cancer in the NHS and NHSII among 200 cases and their
matched controls. In Aim 3 (R00), she will integrate multi-omics data, including metabolomics, proteomics, and
transcriptomics, to characterize the role of inflammation in breast cancer etiology. This research will provide
novel evidence, enhance our understanding of the biological mechanisms involved in breast cancer etiology,
and help identify new prevention strategies for more aggressive forms of the disease. Dr. Romanos-Nanclares’s
scientific aims are supported by three training objectives that will allow her to advance her trajectory toward
becoming an independent investigator: 1) single-omics and multi-omics methodologies and advanced analytics;
2) proteomics study design and execution; and 3) breast cancer etiology and pathophysiology. The training
environment at Brigham and Women’s Hospital will provide exceptional support for Dr. Romanos-Nanclares as
she pursues these development and scientific goals. She has assembled an outstanding interdisciplinary
mentoring team with expertise in cancer epidemiology, multi-omics bioinformatics, breast cancer pathology,
proteomics, and metabolomics. This K99/R00 award will help Dr. Romanos-Nanclares acquire the knowledge
and experience necessary to launch her career as an independent investigator.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Project Summary
Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a heterogeneous condition that occurs most frequently as complicating
comorbidity of very common disease in the western world, including COPD, heart failure, and blood clots in the
lung. In patients with PH secondary to COPD (Group III) mortality risk is about twice as high than in patients with
COPD and normal pulmonary artery pressure. Medications developed successfully for Group I disease have not
shown much utility in Group III PH. Additionally, non-invasive screening and early detection remain challenging.
For this reason, etiology and evolution of PH are still poorly understood and the response to potential
interventions is very difficult to measure.
In recent years, radiologists have been making observation of the loss of distal vasculature (pruning), increased
vascular “tortuosity”, and proximal vascular dilation in patients with PH. In this career development proposal, we
hypothesize that the great power and recent advances in artificial intelligence can be leveraged to identify new
functional and structural markers that define the presence of PH in smokers from non-contrast CT images. These
CT-based features will significantly improve our ability to define the main structural and functional effects of PH
in COPD patients and assess pathological conditions, leading to a better understanding of the genetic and
biological underpinnings of the disease.
Aim 1 of this application involves refining our algorithm for vascular morphology assessment and applying it to
investigate how the pulmonary vasculature is affected in presence of PH Group III. Five markers of presence of
disease will be explored. The goal of Aim 2 is to develop an innovative approach to assess the level of pulmonary
perfusion from non-contrast non cardiac gated CT images and to apply it to explore new functional markers of
disease. Both in Aims 1 and 2 association with biological outcomes will be performed. Finally, in Aim 3 we will
validate the biological relevance of the endpoints determined in Aims 1 and 2 by performing common and rare
variant association studies.
Preliminary data obtained with our published methods show promising results. We show that using artificial
intelligence we can effectively segment pulmonary vessels, separate arteries and veins, and measure small
vessels with an accuracy which outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, we developed an innovative
technique that synthesized perfusion maps from non-contrast CT to assess perfusion defects in PH patients.
Together, the research proposed in the aims of this award will take full advantage of the comprehensive dataset
available through the COPDGene study. The execution of the aims in this proposal will be possible through
active collaboration with Dr. Raul San Jose Estepar, Ph.D. as the mentor and an outstanding Advisory Committee
including renowned leaders in the fields of medical image analysis, translational research, quantitative imaging
in pulmonary vascular disease, and the genetic epidemiology of COPD.

Although neuronavigation systems are of crucial assistance during cerebrovascular surgery, they do not
integrate hemodynamics information needed to treat complex cerebrovascular malformations. The present
project aims at developing an Augmented Reality (AR) neuronavigation tool that will enable the visualization of
cerebral hemodynamics information in the surgical view. Our long-term goal is to contribute toward the
development and clinical adoption of visualization tools that allow for safe and accurate treatment of
cerebrovascular malformations. Our overall objectives in this project are to (i) develop a novel approach based
on deep neural networks that can classify and reconstruct 3D dynamic cerebral vasculature from 2D Digital
Subtraction Angiography (DSA) image series, (ii) compose an AR visualization that will enhance the surgical
view of the brain, and (iii) validate and evaluate our technology in real clinical settings. The rationale for this
project is that such technology will provide a clear and interpretable visualization tool to surgeons that will
support their decision-making process and reduce the time and complex spatial reasoning required to treat
cerebrovascular malformations. To attain the overall objectives, the following three specific aims will be
pursued: 1) develop and validate a method to classify artery and veins in DSA image series to visually
disentangle AVMs, 2) develop and validate a method to build dynamic, virtual 3D model of cerebral vasculature
from pairs of DSA image series and 3) build an AR visualization that aligns DSA image series with the surgical
view and assess its impact providing surgical guidance. In addition, we will examine, through a clinical
retrospective study, and through tests in the operating room on phantom data, the impact of this visualization in
providing surgeons with guidance during cerebrovascular surgery. The proposed project is innovative because
it will be possible to merge the true DSA-derived 3D cerebral hemodynamics with images of the brain surface
seen through a surgical microscope. The proposed project is significant because it will provide visual guidance
and confirmation to surgeons that will facilitate decision-making in the surgical treatment of complex AVMs.
The results are expected to have an important positive impact because they will provide novel neuronavigation
tools to improve the surgical treatment of cerebrovascular malformations and ultimately reduce the risks of
intraoperative hemorrhaging and postsurgical deficits. Furthermore, the methods described here are
cost-effective, adapted to low-resources settings, and can be easily implemented on a large scale, bringing
advanced imaging techniques to far more patients.

Lung diseases exhibit differences between males and females in risk, progression, symptoms,
and response to therapy; rigorous investigation is needed to define the molecular reasons for
these differences. Our previous work has demonstrated that modeling Omics data using gene
regulatory networks can discover key differences driving health and disease. The goal of this K24
is to merge our prior approach to modeling sex differences with mentoring researchers in sex-
and gender-aware data science. Methods will support modelling gender and sex as a
biologic variable using a data science framework, to promote translation of data from the
NHLBI Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine(TOPMed) program to actionable clinical
innovations for COPD. The goal of this Patient Oriented Research program is to mentor trainees
in Omics data science and Network Medicine through a sex and gender lens, which requires not
only considering biology(sex) but societal constructs(gender); to date this approach has been
limited for lung diseases. To advance the dissemination of data analytic approaches for COPD
research, we will focus on sex and gender aware epidemiology, Omic analyses inclusive of X and
Y chromosome data, and gene regulatory network methods. In addition to mentoring and career
development, trainees will pursue the hypothesis that somatic mosaicism on the X chromosome
(mCA X) and loss of Y (LoY) will associate with COPD phenotypes and COPD progression. To
facilitate mentoring, scientific Aims include 1) Investigating whether mCA X and LoY mediate sex
and gender divergent features of COPD and 2) Defining pathway and gene regulatory network
rewiring associated with mCA X and LoY, using single Omic and network-based approaches.
Innovative aspects include the evaluation of gender as well as sex associations with COPD;
investigation of mCA X and LoY and COPD; extension of gene regulatory network approaches to
include somatic mosaicism; and development of a sex- and gender-aware data science toolkit.
Understanding sex and gender differences using tools to integrate Omics and the gene regulatory
landscapes with mCA X and LoY will improve our understanding of COPD and support precision
medicine initiatives. This paradigm shifting K24 will support the training of the next generation of
pulmonary data scientists interested in sex and gender-aware Patient Oriented Research, with
specific application to COPD, a leading cause of death with sex divergent features.

The cytokines IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 are thought to be key effectors of airway inflammation, but remarkably
little is known about either their global function within the respiratory tract or the potential consequences of
their complete inhibition by newly available biologic drugs. The overall goal of the proposed research is to
define the underlying human biology of IL-4Rα and IL-5R signaling in airway inflammation, both their role in
driving type 2 inflammation and their role in counterregulating other systemic immune pathways. We will
determine the cell-specific impacts of these cytokines within the respiratory tract and confirm the influence
of IL-4Rα and IL-5R on the chronic inflammation of patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis
(CRSwNP), severe asthma, and aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD). Further, given that some
drugs now available to inhibit these pathways have poorly understood side effects like new-onset joint pain,
we will establish the systemic immunologic consequences of inhibiting a receptor as widely expressed as
IL-4Rα and will identify novel biomarkers to predict those immune responses. In three separate but
interrelated projects, we aim to:
 1. Define the cellular mechanism(s) of anti-IL-4Rα-induced therapeutic benefit in AERD with a
 prospective study of 8 weeks of dupilumab treatment.
 2. Define the systemic immunologic consequences of IL-4Rα inhibition with dupilumab and determine
 which immunologic changes correlate with the development of arthralgias.
 3. Characterize the functional significance of IL-5Rα on upper airway nasal plasma cells and epithelial
 cells, from patients with healthy sinus mucosa, CRSwNP, and AERD.
These goals will be achieved using patient-oriented research (POR), as each of these aims involve patient
interactions and longitudinal study visits to collect and verify clinical outcomes, and through the mentorship
of the next generation of patient-oriented allergic disease investigators. The proposed studies and the
clinical questions to be examined offer outstanding training opportunities for junior investigators interested in
clinically relevant research in allergy and asthma. Dr. Tanya Laidlaw is a recognized investigator in the
causes of CRSwNP and AERD and the candidate's many ongoing POR projects and collaborations,
commitment to and track record of mentorship, along with the exceptional institutional resources, provide a
first-rate environment for the development of junior investigators. Critically, this award will provide Dr.
Laidlaw protected time for POR in airway inflammation and allergic respiratory disease to both refine her
mentoring and leadership skills and expand her expertise to include predictive biomarker identification,
pathway-level multi-omics analysis, and high dimensional data analyses.

 This K23 application supports Dr. Sheila Hegde, a highly promising cardiac imager and early-stage
investigator who is committed to investigating the underlying mechanisms by which physical activity (PA)
favorably impacts the risk of heart failure (HF) in late-life. Her long-term goal is to be an independent
investigator studying modifiable biomarkers of aging and HF risk that will ultimately inform therapeutic
intervention. The overall scientific objective of this proposal is to identify biologic pathways underlying the
beneficial effects of PA on cardiac function, functional capacity, and HF risk using high dimensional ‘-omic’
data. The main hypothesis is that PA delays age-related changes in cardiac structure and function and
mitigates HF risk through biologic pathways that can be identified through high throughput circulating
proteomic profiling. The specific aims are to: 1) Employ high-throughput plasma proteomics and genomic data
to identify novel molecular pathways underlying longitudinal PA-related changes in cardiovascular structure
and function and incident HF (NHLBI ARIC cohort); and 2) Identify molecular pathways underlying the
beneficial effect of a structured PA intervention on functional capacity with the use of plasma proteomics in
older sedentary adults at high risk of HF. (Brigham and Women’s Hospital-based cohort). These aims will also
serve as a vehicle to achieve the following career and learning objectives: 1) Attain advanced skills in novel,
data science driven methods for high-dimensional data, particularly in proteomics analysis; and 2) Develop the
necessary skills to design, implement, and conduct a clinical trial in order to transition to an independent
clinical investigator. These objectives will be accomplished through: 1) structured interactions with a
committed and expert multidisciplinary panel of mentors and advisors; 2) focused didactic coursework in study
design and statistical approaches relevant to ‘-omic’ data; and 3) progressive participation in multi-institutional
working groups and committees for national multicenter studies, dedicated mini-courses and meetings relevant
to PA and multi ‘-omic’ analyses, and national cardiovascular professional organizations. These activities will
also act as a framework to grow her leadership skills and to develop external collaborations.
 The results of the proposed early career development award will provide further insight into the
underlying cardiovascular mechanisms by which physical activity impacts age-related changes in cardiac
structure and function, functional capacity, and heart failure (HF) risk and serve as the necessary foundation
for Dr. Hegde to transition to an independent investigator.

This NIH K23 proposal details a comprehensive five-year training plan for mentored patient-oriented research
career development and research to address a major problem in neuromuscular medicine. Over half of patients
with clinically suspected Mendelian myopathies do not have a molecular diagnosis, largely due to two challenges:
detecting pathogenic non-coding variants, and resolving the pathogenicity of ultra-rare missense variants. Here
I propose to address this challenge through the application of genome sequencing (Aim 1), transcriptome
sequencing (Aim 2), and proteomic (Aim 3) methods to evaluate the strengths and weakness of each method
and to improve the diagnostic yield from a cohort of approximately 200 individuals with unsolved Mendelian
myopathies. I hypothesize that since the genetic architecture of Mendelian myopathies implicates large genes
that genome sequencing combined with RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) and proteomics can mitigate the current
low diagnostic yield after clinical evaluation of Mendelian myopathies. Through these approaches, I will define
best practices in applying technologies in the diagnostic evaluation, discover novel disease variants and genes,
and expand our understanding of the genetic architecture of these heterogeneous disorders.
Gaining the analytical skills to evaluate the real-world application of multiomic methods will complement both my
prior expertise in gene discovery for neurologic disorders and my clinical training in neuromuscular medicine. I
am uniquely positioned within the collaborative environment between Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Boston
Children’s Hospital, Broad Institute, and Harvard Medical School to facilitate my transition to an independent
physician-scientist with a long-term translational research goal of developing a center of excellence in the clinical
characterization, molecular diagnosis, and evaluation of targeted gene therapy candidates for patients with
Mendelian myopathies.

This NIH K08 Career Development Award proposal describes a five-year training program studying the role of
NLRP3 inflammasome in Tet2-/- clonal hematopoiesis. The widespread presence of blood cells harboring
somatic genetic alterations in the absence of any hematologic malignancy defines the condition known as
clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP). Both human and mouse studies have demonstrated
significant associations between CHIP and cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
chronic liver disease, osteoporosis, and gout. Focused studies on the genes most frequently mutated in CHIP,
epigenetic regulators TET2 and DNMT3A, have implicated increased chemokine expression and
inflammasome hyperactivation in myeloid cells as a possible mechanistic connection between CH and these
diseases. Dysregulated innate immune and inflammatory signaling also contribute to preleukemic states and
pathogenesis of myeloid disease, but precise mechanisms remain unclear. I propose in Aim 1 to study the role
of NLRP3 inflammasome, a key regulator of inflammation and innate immunity, in mediating Tet2-/- clonal
hematopoiesis. I will characterize the functional role of NLRP3 using an orthogonal approach of clonal
hematopoiesis mouse models, human xenografts and patient specimens. In Aim 2, I propose to characterize
the function of NLRP3 inflammasome at the transcriptional and chromatin levels using single cell sequencing
technology. I will further define the hematopoietic progenitor compartment responsible for Tet2-deficient,
NLRP3-dependent clonal expansion. This work will implicate NLRP3 inflammasome activity in the development
of clonal hematopoiesis and suggest new strategies to target the inflammatory drive in CHIP. The applicant,
Dr. Waihay Wong, has completed clinical training in Anatomic Pathology and Hematopathology at Brigham and
Women’s Hospital (BWH) and Harvard Medical School (HMS). He will complete a research program focused
on training as an independent investigator to study the role of NLRP3 inflammasome in mediating Tet2-/- clonal
hematopoiesis. Dr. Wong proposes to develop expertise in next-generation sequencing, computational
analysis, and mouse models of disease. The mentor, Dr. Benjamin Ebert (HHMI Investigator, Professor of
Medicine at HMS and Chair of Medical Oncology at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, DFCI), is a renowned expert
in the biology of hematopoietic cells and clonal hematopoiesis. Dr. Ebert has successfully mentored numerous
physician-scientists to become independent academic investigators. This mentoring will be supported by
formal course work, seminars, presentations at international meetings, and regular meetings with Dr. Wong’s
Advisory Committee which has complementary expertise and experience in mentoring physician-scientists to
develop independent research programs. Dr. Wong will conduct this research at the DFCI and leverage the
exceptional research and teaching environment at the DFCI, Harvard, and the Broad Institute to complete this
work and realize his long-term career goal of becoming an independent physician-scientist.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Summary: While ABO(H) blood group antigens were the first human polymorphisms described and
corresponding anti-ABO(H) antibodies continue to be the most common immunological barrier to transfusion and
transplantation, the factors responsible for anti-ABO(H) antibody development remain relatively unknown. In
order to overcome barriers that result from anti-ABO(H) antibody formation, key processes that drive anti-ABO(H)
antibody development need to be defined. Our long-term goal is to define the factors that regulate naturally
occurring anti-ABO(H) antibody formation. Our central hypothesis is that exposure to microbes that decorate
themselves with ABO(H) blood group-like antigens drives innate-like B1 B cells to produce naturally occurring
anti-ABO(H) antibodies. Our hypothesis is formulated on the basis of our recent discovery that microbes that
decorate themselves with carbohydrate structures that mimic blood group antigens stimulate the formation of
anti-blood group antibodies capable of causing hemolytic transfusion reactions (HTRs). Our data demonstrate
that anti-ABO(H) antibodies isolated from patients display unique specificity for distinct types of ABO(H) antigens
and when examined against microbial glycans isolated and presented on a microbial glycan microarray, engage
unique microbial determinants, strongly suggesting that microbial glycans may shape an individual's anti-ABO(H)
antibody response. However, as ABO(H) blood group antigens are carbohydrate structures largely confined to
humans, preclinical models capable of formally testing this have not been available. To overcome this limitation,
we developed a preclinical model that recapitulates key features of naturally occurring anti-blood group antibody
formation. Knocking out the enzyme required for the synthesis of the murine blood group B-like antigen (murine
B or Bm), we generated blood group O-like (murine O or Om) mice that spontaneously develop varying levels of
anti-Bm antibodies capable of causing Bm RBC HTRs following transfusion. Sorting and culturing anti-Bm reactive
microbiota identified a strain of Klebsiella pneumonia that specifically expresses the Bm antigen, providing a
possible link between the microbiota and anti-Bm antibody development. As blood group Om mice and O
individuals possess innate-like B1 B cells with blood group specificity, these collective data suggest that microbial
stimulation of B1 B cells drives the formation of anti-blood group antibodies capable of causing HTRs. To test
this hypothesis, we will pursue the following specific aims: Aim 1. Define the role of B1 B cells and anti-blood
group antibody reactive microbiota in the development of anti-ABO(H) antibodies capable of causing
HTRs. Aim 2. Define the requirement for B1 B cells in microbiota-induced anti-Bm antibody formation
using a preclinical model. These aims will not only define the impact of the microbiota on the development of
anti-blood group antibodies, but provide a rich training opportunity for me to weld my previous training in
transfusion immunology with new training in glycobiology to define the governing factors that regulate the
development of the most common immunological barrier in not only transfusion, but also transplantation.

Skull base and face imaging accounts for nearly 20% of clinical neuroradiology examinations. But clinical MRI
of the skull base and face continues to rely primarily on conventional 2D T1-weighted and T2-weighted pulse
sequences and fat suppression techniques. These techniques generate suboptimal tissue contrasts with
suboptimal spatial resolution. The long acquisition times often lead to motion artifact. Contrast weightings and
rapid acquisitions tailored to the uniquely small structures of the skull base and face would expand the clinical
utility of MRI for diagnosing pathologies of these regions. Dr. Guenette’s goal for this four-year K08 mentored
career development award is to gain the skills needed to develop comprehensive skull base- and face-specific
MRI sequences and protocols that optimize clinically relevant contrast-to-noise and simultaneously acquire
relaxometry biomarkers that are co-registered to the anatomic images at the voxel level with markedly reduced
scan times compared with current standard-of-care skull base and face MR imaging. Dr. Guenette is a
neuroradiologist with skull base and face sub-specialization at Brigham and Women’s Hospital. His research
has included optimizing product pulse sequences for imaging skull base and face structures. The training
objectives and research activities of this proposal will provide Dr. Guenette with the mentorship, time, and
resources to learn and apply MRI physics, pulse sequence design, and image processing. The main research
expertise of Dr. Guenette’s mentor, Dr. Bruno Madore, an MRI physicist, lies in the development of novel
acquisition and image reconstruction strategies for MRI. The co-mentor, Dr. Ravi Uppaluri, is an
otolaryngology-head/neck surgeon physician-scientist with complementary clinical expertise. In Aim 1 Dr.
Guenette will: build a normative atlas of quantitative T2, T1, and relative proton density values of anatomic
structures in the skull base and face; use this atlas to generate and test theoretically optimal contrasts for
nerve imaging; establish normative T2, T1, and relative proton density values of head and neck squamous cell
carcinoma (HNSCC) tumors to generate and test optimal contrasts for visualizing and segmenting HNSCC
tumors; and test the biomarker potential of T2, T1, and relative proton density measures in HNSCC. In Aim 2
he will: develop a novel pulse sequence that incorporates scanner gradient strength as a parameter to further
decrease scan times and evaluate synthetic pulse sequences across 1.5T, 3T, and 7T field strengths. The
training and data will facilitate Dr. Guenette’s long-term goal to independently lead an NIH-funded laboratory
focused on developing and implementing more rapid qualitative MR anatomic imaging and quantitative MR
methods specifically tailored to the skull base, face, and neck structures and pathologies.

Fibroblasts are key aggressors in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) where they mediate cartilage and bone destruction,
yet treatments that directly target these cells are lacking. Recent studies from our group and others have
shown that the expansion of an inflammatory subset of fibroblasts are critical to perpetuating the chronic
inflammation in RA, but mechanisms responsible for their inflammatory potentiation are not well-defined. Our
preliminary studies have revealed that synovial fibroblasts are uniquely poised to signal through the Wnt
pathway and further demonstrate that Wnt induces a strong inflammatory response in these cells. Notably,
there is a striking transcriptional gradient demarcated by a Wnt enhancer, R-spondin 3 (RSPO3), and a
putative Wnt inhibitor, Dickkopf-related protein 3 (DKK3), that correlates with Wnt pathway enrichment. We find
that synovial fibroblasts derived from active RA patients show enrichment of gene signatures associated with
Wnt activation and Rspo3 expression, suggesting relevance to arthritis manifestation. We hypothesize that Wnt
signaling through this gradient is critical for mediating inflammatory fibroblast pathogenicity and that Wnt
inhibition can ameliorate joint damage in RA. We develop our hypothesis in three independent aims. In Aim 1,
we define the role of Rspo3 and Dkk3 in regulating Wnt-induced synovial fibroblast activation in vitro using
ligand stimulation and knockdown techniques. In Aim 2, we assess Rspo3 and Dkk3 regulation of Wnt
signaling in synovial fibroblasts of distinct RA patient clinical and histologic phenotypes. Finally, in Aim 3, we
evaluate the clinical utility of targeting stromal Wnt signaling therapeutically in mouse models of inflammatory
arthritis. We anticipate that the significance of these studies will be to elucidate a molecular mechanism
contributing to fibroblast pathogenicity in RA and to address the unmet need for fibroblast-specific therapeutics.
These studies will provide training in immunology, bioinformatics, and murine models of inflammatory arthritis
that that will build a foundation for the PI to develop an independent lab studying the role of stromal cells in
autoimmune disease.

 Over 200 million people are infected with malaria every year. An effective and long-lasting vaccine will
be essential for the elimination and eradication of malaria in Sub-Sharan Africa and worldwide. Though WHO-
approved circumsporozoite protein (CSP) protein vaccine RTS,S is the only vaccine in current use, it provides
<50% protection that is also short lived. The proposed research will delve into the humoral immunity of the
whole sporozoite vaccine (PfSPZ), a model system to identify protective immune responses beyond the
immunodominant epitope CSP - essential insights needed to create new, highly effective malaria vaccines.
 This proposal describes a five-year career development plan to study humoral immunity to the malaria-
causing pathogen Plasmodium falciparum. Though antibodies are important for PfSPZ-mediated protection,
the protective antibody targets and functions remains unknown. Further, PfSPZ's efficacy drops in malaria-
exposed individuals and how pre-existing anti-malarial antibodies affect PfSPZ vaccination remains
unanswered. Our preliminary systems serology analysis of malaria naïve PfSPZ vaccinees has suggested a
new protective role for IgM antibodies to SSP2/TRAP, a malaria host cell recognition and invasion protein, and
validated our approach. The studies proposed here are to 1) define the functional antibody correlates of
protection in malaria-exposed individuals and the effect of pre-existing immunity 2) identify new correlates of
protection with a whole-proteome approach, and 3) define mechanisms of anti-sporozoite immunity of
SSP2/TRAP IgM antibodies. These aims will be carried out with human serum from PfSPZ vaccination and
controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) challenge trials in malaria-naïve and exposed individuals.
 The candidate is currently an Associate Physician at Brigham and Women's Hospital, Instructor in
Medicine at Harvard Medical School (HMS), and Research Fellow at the Ragon Institute with an ongoing
commitment of 80% time to research. The proposal is supported by an expert mentor in humoral immunology,
HMS Professor Facundo Batista, and co-Mentored by expert in systems biology MIT Professor Douglas
Lauffenburger. The candidate is supported by a SAC containing an expert in phage display serological assays,
HMS Professor Stephen Elledge, an expert in malaria vaccinology, NIAID Chief of Cellular Immunology Dr. Robert
Seder, and expert in malaria host-pathogen interactions and pre-erythrocytic immunity University of Washington
Associate Professor Noah Sather. Building on the candidate's doctoral training in malaria pathogenesis and
genomics, this proposal will further his training in humoral immunology, systems biology, and bioinformatics as well
as research scientist-focused professional development and responsible conduct of research coursework.
Completion of this comprehensive training plan will enable the candidate to create a successful and unique research
program, obtain independent funding, and transition to running an independent laboratory focused on malaria
antibody immunology, phage display serologic assay tool development, and vaccinology.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Autism spectrum and related neurodevelopmental disorders are thought to arise from widespread mild synaptic
dysfunction that leads to an altered trajectory of brain network development (Johnson et al., 2015). In Rett
syndrome (RTT), a debilitating neurodevelopmental disorder, loss-of-function mutations in MECP2 on the X
chromosome lead to a devastating loss of language, motor and visual function at the behavioral level. Yet no
therapy exists to stop or reverse the cognitive decline. Previous work in RTT mouse models reveal synaptic- and
network-level defects that precede symptom onset. Mecp2-deficiency alters the timing of excitatory synaptic
maturation in excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the developing cortex (Mierau et al, 2016). Microelectrode
array (MEA) recordings and calcium imaging of neuronal activity in cultured murine cortical neurons reveal delays
in the development of functional connectivity in the Mecp2-deficient cortical networks including smaller network
size, weaker strength of connectivity and impairments in the development of network topology including features
that predict local and global efficiency of the networks (Dunn et al, unpublished). These findings reveal cellular-
scale deficits in information processing that likely underlie the cognitive impairment in RTT and could be targeted
with novel therapies to rescue cognitive function. In my proposed K02 and subsequent R01 research, we will
translate this approach to a human in vitro cellular model of RTT. In Aim 1, air-liquid interface cortical organoids
(ALI-COs) will be generated from RTT patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and allogenic
controls to first identify network-level defects in the development of cortical networks. The ALI-CO model shows
further cortical maturation than previous organoid models and avoids the necrotic core (Giandomenico et al.,
2019). In Aim 2, we will target excitatory synaptic maturation in a specific type of inhibitory neuron in the MeCP2-
deficient ALI-COs using novel cell-type specific modulators we identified (Mierau et al, unpublished). Our goal
is to prevent early synaptic defects and ensure the formation of network activity and topology necessary to
support cellular-scale information processing. This strategy could be used in our future R01 research to prevent
the cognitive decline in RTT. In Aim 3, we will develop novel tools for detecting and modulating network dynamics
in the MeCP2-deficient ALI-COs as a platform for testing strategies to rescue network function in RTT after the
cognitive decline has occurred. Re-expressing Mecp2 in adult Mecp2-deficient mice rescues many behavioral
and synaptic features, raising the hope that neuronal function can be rescued in RTT even after the cognitive
decline. We will next test dynamic electric, optogenetic, and pharmacologic approaches for modulating cognitive
function. This will support the subsequent R01 aims in Year 4 and 5 of the K02 award to test whether modulating
network function in real-time can rescue network function in RTT ALI-COs. This strategy would facilitate
screening of novel therapies to unlock function in symptomatic RTT patients and could be applied in the future
to develop new therapies for autism spectrum and other cognitive disorders.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
While opioid drugs are very effective for controlling pain, they are highly addictive. The current clinical decision
making for post-surgical opioid prescribing is still based on oversimplified information. Both opioid use disorder
and opioid-related pain response have strong genetic underpinnings. A better system is needed to guide the
clinical use of genotype data and facilitate better-informed opioid prescribing decision-making.
Electronic health record (EHR) offer a largely untapped source of information to conduct clinically oriented
studies. By integrating genomic data and EHR dataset in large-scale clinical Biobank, we can now perform
"clinical-driven genomic research". This approach is particularly robust for complex diseases with a genetic
susceptibility.
I propose to develop a model to recommend optimal opioid dosage (oral morphine milligram equivalents) for
post-surgical pain relief and predict the risk of post-discharge harmful outcomes. The large-scale clinical and
genomic databases from the Mass General Brigham (MGB) healthcare system, including eight hospitals that
share a centralized database, will be utilized for model development. The proposed research will not only have
strong immediate potential to improve clinical practice in this urgent area but will also provide strong
preliminary work to support my first NIH R01 application.
From the previous projects, I have developed opioid use disorder clinical phenotypes and identified associated
genetic markers. I have also developed machine learning models to predict risks of complex diseases and
explored clinical application potentials. The proposed project will combine my existing analytical skills with the
newer expertise that I seek to develop through this award program, including a nuanced understanding of
analgesic strategies, addiction, and implementation of clinical decision support systems, as well as artificial
intelligence applications in healthcare system.
I have invited several established investigators to form a strong, multi-disciplinary mentorship team. They
include experts in the fields of addiction, pain management, genetic analysis, implementation methods and
artificial intelligence techniques. With their support, I intend to dedicate my longer-term research career to
study functional genomics in the fields of opioid addiction and pain by using integrated analysis of harmonized
big data. The K01 program outlined in this application will provide timely and strategic support for my continued
advancement towards those goals.

The Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD) is a ubiquitous resource for basic research and clinical
interpretation. The world’s largest genetic variation resource, the gnomAD dataset is used in virtually all clinical
genetic diagnostic pipelines worldwide, and the website has over 20 million page views to date. Here we
outline a proposal that will expand the gnomAD resource to millions of samples across diverse global
populations. Our proposal will scale variant-calling and quality control to match this sample size, integrate
statistical tools and other genomic resources critical to clinical interpretation, and ensure that the data we
aggregate will continue to be shared freely with the biomedical community. To accomplish this we will apply a
highly computationally efficient strategy to call all classes of variation (including SNVs, small indels, and the
mutational spectrum of structural variants) across millions of sequenced samples enriched for under-
represented ancestry groups. We will deploy a cloud-based framework for the efficient storage and automated
quality control of these very large and heterogeneous sequence data sets using the massively parallel Hail
architecture. We will leverage the scale of gnomAD to provide increasingly high-resolution maps of the
depletion of functional variation across regions of the genome (highlighting genome regions where natural
selection constrains DNA change) and provide statistical frameworks for quantitatively assessing whether the
population frequency of a variant is consistent with pathogenicity, linking this information with evidence from
the ClinVar resource. We will continue to share all of this data as rapidly and openly as possible with the
biomedical community, long before publication. We will support and expand functionality in our widely
accessed data browser as well as create scalable and publicly accessible datasets that integrate our variation
data with clinical and functional genomic annotations, accessible through API frameworks to empower novel
applications of the datasets. We will also provide resources and training to improve the use of gnomAD
resources by the clinical genetics and wider biomedical communities.

 The decreasing cost of genomic sequencing will yield millions of samples in the coming years from both
research and healthcare. Sharing this data is necessary to understand human diseases and eventually help
patients, but doing so requires the community to agree on common methods for collecting, storing, transferring,
accessing, and analyzing data. This proposal will support the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health
(GA4GH; www.ga4gh.org) to aid genomic research and human health by developing standards and policies for
effective and responsible data sharing between institutions and countries around the world.
 To advance responsible sharing of global genomic and health-related data, genomics researchers,
clinicians, bioinformaticians, software engineers, and industry experts will work together as a single GA4GH
community to deliver genomic data sharing standards and frameworks (e.g., ontologies, guidelines, technical
schemas). Building on our five years of experience convening stakeholders and developing work products, we
will engage the genomics and health community in the very earliest stages of development to ensure our work
is useful and ready for adoption.
 We will leverage the combined effort of several hundred active contributors to advance development
activities beyond the capacity of our small staff team. These contributors will work within eight GA4GH Work
Streams, each focused on developing critical standards and frameworks, including cloud-based data
federation, scalable schemas and interfaces, data models, and file formats. We will engage deeply within the
broader healthcare, research, and commercial sectors, including the launch of the Genomics in Health
Implementation Forum to drive uptake in the clinical domain.
 A federated ecosystem for searching, discovering, exchanging, and analyzing genomic and clinical data
will enable a global learning health system that advances both research and clinical care beyond their
individual capacities and depends on standards and interoperable frameworks embraced by the entire
community. We envision a future in which the full suite of GA4GH standards enables all clinicians, geneticists,
and researchers to search across the world’s collective genomic data to reveal unanticipated gene-disease
associations, make otherwise impossible drug-response predictions, and generally participate in genomics at a
competitive pace—regardless of their means or location. The promise of genomic medicine lies at a
crossroads that depends on harmonization across the community and will significantly enhance the human
experience if we succeed. We believe that GA4GH is necessary to that success.

Many steps in drug discovery, as well as in basic biological research, could be accelerated with methods that
measure multiple phenotypes simultaneously, known as profiling technologies. When a cell or organism’s
function is affected by disease, a chemical compound, or a genetic perturbation, simultaneously measuring
many phenotypes provides greater power and less bias in identifying their impact. But many existing assays
require many painstaking months to develop and measure only one specific phenotype, missing potentially
crucial information - for example, a chemical might have positive effects on a disease-related assay but its
effects on other pathways are unmeasured, leading to undetected toxicity that is only discovered later.
Research in this MIRA period will focus on advancing algorithms and applications for image-based profiling, a
surprisingly quantitative type of profiling that is the least expensive and among the highest in information
content. Image-based profiling captures the location and amount of each stained cellular component, as well as
changes in morphology, but its applications are underexplored and its algorithms underdeveloped. Having
invented the main assay and software in the field, we aim to bring the technique to maturity now that four
things have become available or possible: (a) Image Data - huge quantities of suitable systematic, structured,
high-throughput, single-cell image data, usually from the Cell Painting assay, via several public-private
partnerships and totaling more than 3 billion single cells across more than 100,000 genetic and chemical
perturbations; (b) Algorithms - novel deep learning algorithms for several steps in profiling: segmentation,
feature extraction, and learning predictive models; (c) Integration - other data sources now available at a
scale that can be fruitfully combined with images; (d) Applications - out of more than a dozen theoretical
applications, many have not been attempted or scaled up for basic biological research and drug discovery, such
as determining compounds’ mechanism of action, identifying their targets, discovering relationships with
genes, predicting toxicity or other assay activity, and identifying gene function.
To fulfill the promise and real-world efficacy of image-based profiling, we therefore aim to leverage recently
available data and algorithms to carry out diverse biological applications, including identifying gene- and
compound-associated phenotypes and functions, virtual screening to identify potential compounds that target
genes of interest, hypothesizing the mechanism of action/targets for small molecules, computationally
predicting assay activity and toxicity, and identifying screenable disease-associated phenotypes. In doing so, we
aim to make rapid progress in algorithms, including trained neural networks/deep learning models, multi-
modal integration, visualization/interpretation, batch correction, and single-cell methods.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
Prion disease is a uniquely rapid, universally fatal progressive neurodegenerative disease of humans and other
mammals. It arises from a single protein, the native prion protein (PrP), which is capable of post-translationally
misfolding into a self-templating and deadly “prion.” Genetic and pharmacological proofs of concept
increasingly identify PrP dosage as the key to understanding, and ultimately intercepting this pathogenic
cascade. In mice with genetically altered PrP levels, lower PrP levels lead to longer survival following prion
infection, while excess PrP hastens disease. PrP-lowering antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) now show
promise as a potential therapeutic strategy. However, effective implementation will hinge on a deeper
understanding of how PrP level controls the rates of prion nucleation, replication and neurotoxicity, and how
this control translates across disease timepoints, species and strains. Though almost all human prion disease
originates in the brain, PrP-lowering interventions have not yet been tested in spontaneous, rather than
inoculated, prion models. Meanwhile, the magnitude of protection conveyed by 50% genetic PrP reduction can
vary between model systems; the relative contributions of slowed prion replication and slowed neurotoxicity to
observed survival benefit in different species and prion strains remain to be disentangled. Finally, PrP lowering
must be studied in the context of patient-derived human prions, to assess how above learnings extrapolate to
strains of public health interest. We will fill these gaps by assessing the following. 1) Kinetics of spontaneous
prion formation. Using a new mouse model of spontaneous prion disease, we will track the spontaneously
disease process through serial molecular measurements of neuronal damage and prion seeding activity.
Through PrP-lowering tool compounds administered at different timepoints, we will disentangle how PrP
dosage modulates prion formation, amplification, neurotoxicity and symptomatic progression. 2) Rapid and
slow prion subtypes as a function of PrP dosage. Using newly engineered PrP knockout hamster and rat
models, we will characterize the kinetics of pathological biomarker rise relative to disease onset and terminal
illness as a function of PrP expression level in both canonically rapid (hamster) and more slowly progressive
(rat) prion disease systems. 3) Impact of PrP lowering on human prions. Using a series of novel
“humanized” mouse lines expressing human PrP at six different dosage levels, that have been shown
susceptible to multiple clinically relevant human prion strains, we will characterize time to pathology, symptom
onset, and terminal illness. PrP level will be varied on a lifelong basis through genetically manipulation, as well
as through postnatal, precisely timed intervention with PrP-lowering tool compounds. Taken together, these
studies will illuminate PrP’s control of disease kinetics across a spectrum of prion disease paradigms, while
building a scientific foundation to guide future development of PrP-lowering therapeutics.

The past decade has seen outstanding advances in the genetics of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Most of
this progress has occurred by the study of rare genetic variation, especially de novo variation, with the Autism
Sequencing Consortium (ASC) playing a central role. The ASC represents a coordinated international effort to
identify ASD risk genes. In our most recent, unpublished, analyses of 72,410 individuals from ASD families, we
identified 185 genes associated with risk (FDR < 0.05). Some of these genes have been linked to a broad array
of developmental disorders, while others have not. Based on these results, we posit that some risk genes alter
the core features of ASD, while creating fewer perturbations to other features of development: discovery of such
genes will provide deeper insights into pathways disrupted in ASD. We will build on this progress by analysis of
sequence data from three resources: ASD subjects and families; subjects with other developmental and neuro-
psychiatric disorders; and subjects from population samples. We plan new research focusing on interpretation
of rare variation, including single nucleotide variation (SNV), indels, and copy number variation (CNV). Our key
targets are inherited variants, including X-linked inherited variants, which to date have shown very little signal,
and missense variants, for which signal has been confined to highly conserved substitutions. We anticipate
doubling the number of ASD genes discovered, ~ 400, by increasing the number of families analyzed and by
refined methods to interpret inherited and missense variation. And, in parallel, we expect to resolve critical as-
pects of ASD genetic architecture and to unveil key aspects of what makes ASD and its core features – social
deficits and restrictive and repetitive behaviors – different from other neurodevelopmental disorders. To discover
ASD risk genes with a distinct effect on ASD, we have the following specific aims: 1) To amalgamate existing
and emerging whole exome and whole genome sequence data; 2) To develop new analytical methods and
analyze the accumulated sequence data; and, 3) To contrast ASD and other neurodevelopmental disorder risk
genes, examining developmental profiles, cell types implicated, and whether variants in the same gene differ in
how they affect risk for ASD and other neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. With this new research
we will accelerate our overall objective, which is the identification of ASD genes, thereby facilitating our long-
term goal of building the foundation from which therapeutic targets for ASD emerge. Our rationale is that the
identification of genes conferring significant risk to ASD and associated neurodevelopmental disorders can form
the basis of studies to understand pathogenesis, as well as the basis for novel therapies. Our central hypothesis
– formulated based on results over the past decade – is that rare and common variation contributes additively to
risk for ASD, but only certain rare variants confer substantial risk. The research proposed is innovative, in our
opinion, because it uses groundbreaking and novel statistical methods for identifying risk variants for ASD.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Cardiometabolic diseases affect millions of people worldwide and have numerous underlying risk factors. Commensal microbes that comprise the intestinal microbiome are implicated in the progression and onset of many of these diseases, including type 2 diabetes, obesity, and atherosclerosis. Gut microbes have extensive metabolic capabilities, allowing them to produce or modify molecules that influence disease risk. Members of the gut microbiota have been known to convert cholesterol into the poorly absorbable metabolite coprostanol for almost 100 years, however the microbial genes responsible for this metabolism were not known. In recent work, we analyzed paired gut metagenomic and metabolomic data to identify a novel group of cholesterol dehydrogenases that metabolize cholesterol when expressed in vitro. Using clinical and metagenomic data from the Framingham Heart Study (FHS), we observed lower serum cholesterol in subjects whose microbiomes encode these cholesterol dehydrogenases. The cholesterol dehydrogenases we originally described convert cholesterol to cholestenone and coprostanone to coprostanol, and we have since identified the intermediate enzyme that converts cholestenone to coprostanone. In this proposal, we will functionally characterize metabolism of sterols in the gut and determine the impact of this process on cardiometabolic disease. In Aim 1, we will identify determinants of host-microbe interactions by collecting and analyzing clinical variables with stool and serum samples from the Gen3/Omni2 FHS cohorts. We will generate coupled stool and serum metabolomics and metagenomics datasets, perform culturomics to assemble a microbial strain library, and identify host exposomes from clinical data. We will then utilize these data to identify and prioritize microbially- derived or modified circulating metabolites associated with CVD for further mechanistic investigations. In Aim 2, We will couple bioinformatics with microbiology and biochemistry for targeted identification of enzymes/proteins that alter sterol structures. This effort will allow us to probe the diversity of gut microbial sterol metabolizing enzymes and their substrates in order to determine specific microbes and genes with the capacity to modify cholesterol. Taking a systems-level approach, we will colonize mice with cholesterol-metabolizing microbial communities to determine how microbial metabolism modulates serum cholesterol and pathways central to cardiovascular disease. In Aim 3, we will functionally link microbiome enzyme activity to sterol metabolism and metabolic disease. We will employ cell-based transcriptional and proteomic assays to interrogate the effects of microbially-modified sterols on local sterol sensing pathways in epithelial cells and measure the effects of circulating sterol metabolites on human immune cells.

CRISPR-Cas9 is an RNA-guided endonucleases that is being actively used for sequence-specific DNA
recognition, genome engineering, targeted transcriptional activation/repression and genome imaging. Cas9 is
being developed as a gene therapy agent for multiple pathologies, including HIV, vision disorders, muscular
dystrophy, and hereditary disorders. The precision control of specificity of CRISPR-Cas9 is required as off-
target effects and chromosomal translocations are observed at elevated activity. Further, the ease of targeting
catalytically impaired Cas9 to any genomic locus has resulted in transformative technologies. For example, the
fusion of catalytically inactive Cas9 (dCas9) to transcriptional activators or repressors has enabled gene
transcription and repression; fusion of catalytically impaired Cas9 to base-modifying enzymes has allowed base
conversion (e.g., C→T) at specific genomic sites; dCas9‒GFP fusion has made imaging genomic loci possible;
and dCas9‒acetyltransferases or deacetylases fusion has enabled epigenome editing. We propose to apply
chemical and genetic approaches develop reagents and methods that will allow precision control of specificity
of CRISPR-Cas9.

 The direct manipulation of genes and gene products in vivo has enormous therapeutic potential, and many
strategies to achieve these goals are swiftly advancing toward clinical use. Proteins that can manipulate DNA,
RNA, and proteins in living cells, including genome editing technologies that enable the precise correction of
disease-causing mutations in vivo, have exemplified the promise of such approaches both for research and
therapeutic applications. While many of these approaches have shown promise in initial research studies,
proteins often require extensive development and tailoring to acquire the activity, specificity, and stability needed
to serve as impactful research tools or leads for therapeutic development. As new macromolecular therapeutic
modalities continue to be developed at a remarkable rate, methods to generate proteins on a rapid time scale
with tailor-made functions are needed. Ideally such methods will be versatile and can be applied to many
classes of problems in the life sciences.
 Our lab developed phage-assisted continuous evolution (PACE), a technology to evolve biomolecules ≥100-
fold faster than using conventional laboratory evolution approaches, with minimal required researcher
intervention. We have demonstrated the ability of PACE to evolve many different classes of proteins with new
and altered activities, specificities, and other desirable properties such as soluble expression in E. coli. Proteins
evolved using PACE have shown broad utility in multiple non-bacterial settings, including genome editing agents
that have been applied to rescue human cell and animal models of genetic diseases, and insecticidal proteins
that kill agricultural pests. These developments establish PACE as a broadly applicable and highly enabling
technology for generating therapeutically and biotechnologically relevant proteins.
 We propose to apply PACE to evolve novel proteins with therapeutic potential, or that enable new
technologies for therapeutics discovery. These proteins include next-generation precision genome editing
agents that can be more easily delivered in vivo or are more efficient and clinically relevant; self-delivering
proteases that cleave endogenous protein targets implicated in neurodegenerative disorders and brain cancer;
and small molecule-binding proteins that enable drug-induced target protein degradation. Success would
provide a foundation for innovative therapeutic strategies to correct mutations that cause human genetic
diseases, and to reprogram self-delivering proteases as catalytic drugs to treat brain diseases. In addition, by
creating drug-sensitive alleles that allow a protein of interest to be degraded in a small molecule-dependent
manner, the proposed research would establish powerful new functional genomics tools to reveal biological
functions and validate therapeutics targets. Collectively, the proposed research integrates powerful protein
evolution technologies with enzymes that precisely manipulate genomes and proteomes to advance
therapeutics science.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：The contemporary clinical successes of immunotherapies have highlighted the key role of tumor-infiltrating cells
in mediating anti-tumor immunity and have generally associated the presence of T cells within tumors with
therapeutic response. However, until now, a systematic approach for evaluating how T cell state, their clonal
identity and localization are related has not been possible. In recent years, the Wu lab has achieved several
notable technical advances, including generation of a best-in-class HLA class I epitope predictor (HLAthena); a
highly robust targeted plate-based method for single-cell TCR sequencing (rhTCRseq); and a means to
parallelize the cloning of hundreds of TCRs such that they can be interrogated to definitively link a TCR with its
antigen specificity. Because dynamic interactions between tumor-reactive T cells and malignant clones occur
within the defined spatial ordering of tissue, our valuable new insights motivate us to investigate how the spatial
organization of tumor-specific T cells relates to in situ positioning of tumor clones. We hypothesize that antigen
specificity, which drives the interactions between T cells and tumor cells, impacts the distinct regional localization
of T cells within the tumor microenvironment at baseline and in the context of therapy; conversely, that knowledge
of spatial localization identifies T cell clones specific for distinct antigen types. Slide-seq technology, created by
the Chen lab, provides a tractable and exciting path to investigate this hypothesis by implementing a scalable
approach to undertake in-depth analyses of informative human and murine tumor tissues. By expanding the
capabilities of this unbiased cellular resolution spatial capture method, we aim to gain tissue level understanding
of how the abundance and functional state of T cell clones and their spatial orientation within the tumor
microenvironment are linked. In particular, the study will address the spatial organization of T cell clones and
tumor subclones in human and mouse tumors. Our technology goals will be to increase the efficiency of
transcript capture of the technology, extend the capability to include robust detection of tumor mutations, and to
develop a suite of analytic tools to integrate in a multi model fashion the transcript, DNA-level and TCR levels of
information (Aims 1-2). Focusing on RCC tumors, we will evaluate the cell-cell localization patterns of T cell
clones in relation to tumor subclones and stromal cells through integrated spatial analyses of TCR and DNA
Slide-seq data (Aim 2). Finally, we will evaluate the impact of antigen specificity (definitively assessed by robust
TCR reconstruction and interrogation methods established in our lab) on T cell phenotype and localization using
TCR and DNA Slide-seq integrated spatial analyses at baseline and following immune checkpoint blockade and
neoantigen vaccine. (Aim 3) Altogether, we will develop and test these tools to understand spatially localized
cellular networks which drive immune response, and T-cell receptor relationships with the tumor
microenvironment. The completion of our work will yield a comprehensive toolset to enable a molecular,
cellular and histological understanding of the tumor immune response.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by b-site APP cleaving enzyme-1 (BACE-1) is the rate-
limiting step in production of Ab, whose deposition is the pathological hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease
(AD). Despite a rapidly growing burden of health care for the aging United States, there is a fundamental
gap in understanding how trafficking and mutations of APP influence neuronal function and contribute to
AD pathogenesis. Continued existence of this gap represents a critical problem because, until it is filled,
AD prevention and treatment based on molecular understanding of the disease progression remains
inaccessible. Since neurons can grow axons that are up to a meter long, continuous imaging of APP
trafficking and processing in live neurons at the single-molecule level requires extremely photostable
fluorophores. Our lab has recently developed a new class of upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) that
are immensely photostable over months. The overall objective of this project is to use our novel
photostable UCNPs to perform single-molecule imaging of the trafficking and processing of APP in live
human induced neurons (iNs) – an excellent model system as many human diseases are not fully
recapitulated in mouse neurons. The central hypothesis is that mutations of APP lead to impaired axonal
transport and render APP more vulnerable for b-cleavage by BACE-1. This hypothesis has been
formulated on the basis of previous work on culture mouse neurons and transgenic mouse models. The
rationale for the proposed research is that ultralong-term single molecule imaging of WT and mutant APP
in human iNs will reveal axonal transport defects caused by AD-associated mutations, providing
important insights into their relationship to AD. Guided by strong preliminary data on the novel
experimental platform, the hypothesis will be tested by pursuing the three specific aims: 1) Measure the
trafficking dynamics of endocytosed APP in human iNs; 2) Determine how axonal transport is impaired
by mutations of APP in human iNs; and 3) Visualize the association dynamics of APP and BACE-1 in
human iNs. A battery of techniques including single-molecule imaging, nanotechnology, biochemistry
and stem cell technology will be used to interrogate APP trafficking. The approach is innovative because
it departs from the status quo by utilizing extremely photostable UCNPs to perform long-term single-
molecule tracking, novel analysis for non-invasive determination of motor number, and the use of human
induced neurons. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to characterize in depth
the trafficking and association dynamics of APP and BACE-1 with unprecedented spatiotemporal
resolution, as well as uncover the extent to which APP mutations impair axonal transport, thereby
shedding light on future prevention and treatment of AD.

 The Center for Open Bioimage Analysis will serve the cell biology community’s growing need for
sophisticated software for light microscopy image analysis. Quantitative image analysis has become an
indispensable tool for biologists using microscopy throughout basic biological and biomedical research.
 Quantifying images is now a critical, widespread need as imaging experiments continue to grow in scale,
size, dimensionality, scope, modality, and complexity. Many biologists are missing out on the quantitative
bioimaging revolution due to lack of effective algorithms and/or usable software for their needs, or lack of
access to training. The Center brings together the Carpenter laboratory at the Broad Institute and the Eliceiri
laboratory at the University of Wisconsin­Madison, and in doing so brings together the two most popular open
source bioimage analysis projects, ImageJ (including ImageJ2 and FIJI) and CellProfiler. Through the
collaborative development and dissemination of open source image analysis software, as well as training
events and resources, the Center will empower thousands of researchers to apply advanced analytics in
innovative ways to address new experimental areas.
 Building on the team’s expertise developing algorithms and user­friendly software for use in biology under
real­world conditions, the Center will focus on two Technology Research and Development (TR&D) projects:
deep learning­based image processing, and accessibility of image­processing algorithms for biologists. This
work will not occur in isolation at the Center; rather, the Center will nucleate a larger community working on
these two areas and serve as a catalyst and organizing force to create software and resources shared by all.
 The Driving Biological Projects (DBPs) will serve a major role in driving the TR&D work: our teams are
accustomed to working deeply and iteratively on problems side by side and with frequent feedback from
biologists. This will ensure that important cell biological problems drive the work of the Center. The DBPs
reflect tremendous variety in terms of biological questions, model systems, imaging modalities, and researcher
expertise and will ensure robustness of our tools for the widest possible impact on the community. Continuing
the teams’ track record with ImageJ and CellProfiler, two mature open source bioimage analysis software
projects critical to the work of biologists worldwide, the Center will also assist and train biologists in applying
the latest computational techniques to important biological problems involving images.
 In short, the need for robust, accurate, and readily usable software is more urgent than ever. The Center for
Open Bioimage Analysis will serve as a hub for pioneering new computational strategies for diverse biological
problems, translating them into user­friendly software, further developing ImageJ and CellProfiler, and training
the biological community to apply advanced software to important and diverse problems in cell biology.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
This proposal outlines a five-year research and career development program aimed at building computational
frameworks for understanding the phenotypic effects of perturbations and somatic alterations in cancer. The
application is heavily based on the candidate’s extensive PhD training in Carnegie Mellon University’s world-
renowned Computer Science Department. It is also grounded in the candidate’s rich prior experience working
as an Associate Computational Biologist at the Broad Institute, and his large network of top-level physicians
and scientists in the cancer field. It also leverages his current postdoctoral appointment under Dr. Gad Getz at
the Broad Institute, and the unique set of resources, facilities, collaborations and expertise in this institute.
Along with a series of relevant didactics and career building activities, these studies will form the basis of his
transition to an independent tenure track position as a scientist guided by the goal of enabling long-term
modeling and understanding of cancer as a disease. The large-scale availability of next-generation sequencing
data for cancer has offered an unprecedented characterization of somatic changes that happen in this disease.
Understanding their combinatorial phenotypic effects is still an open problem, and powerful in vitro perturbation
protocols have been designed to experimentally probe these effects. However, the search space for possible
combinations of perturbations to screen is prohibitively large. The objective of this work is to provide principled
Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven methodology for inferring the effects of perturbations and observed somatic
alterations in cancer, a crucial step in understanding the mechanisms. The proposed work draws on recent
development in the technical fields of machine learning and causal discovery. In particular, two Specific Aims
will be evaluated: (Aim 1) inferring causal graphs from single-cell RNA-seq (with the option of pairing it with
whole-exome/whole-genome sequencing); (Aim 2) using a deep generative model, along with paired whole-
exome/whole-genome sequencing, to learn latent underlying factors of variation in single-cell RNA-seq. The
proposed work also includes steps to validate these computational aims. When completed, this work will
advance the field via algorithms/resources that can be used to: (1) use causal knowledge to computationally
select combinations of targets to test in the lab; and (2) computationally infer the effects of somatic DNA
alterations of interest on expression, leading to improved downstream experiment design. Therefore, put
together, the proposed aims are a crucial step in understanding mechanisms in cancer, and will lead to
significant progress towards efficiently discovering drugs for this disease.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The dissemination of antibiotic resistance and the drying-up of antibiotic discovery pipelines threaten to
increase morbidity from routine medical procedures and worsen the spread of infectious diseases. The main
objective of this project is to address the dual challenges of antibiotic resistance and discovery by (1)
pinpointing the cellular pathways involved in antibiotic-induced bacterial cell death and (2) leveraging these
mechanistic data to discover and develop novel structural classes of antibiotics from chemical libraries of >11
million compounds. The working hypothesis is that antibiotic mechanisms of action (MoAs) manifest through
physical changes to cellular structures, and that approaches to antibiotic discovery which integrate this MoA
information can more reliably discover novel classes of antibiotics than current discovery pipelines. This
hypothesis will be tested in two specific aims: (1) develop novel methods of probing and perturbing antibiotic
lethality at the single-cell level (Years 1 to 4) and (2) develop a computational platform for deep learning
classes of new antibiotics which exploits the mechanisms of action of known antibiotics (Years 2 to 5). During
the first phase of this award, microfluidic, optical, and fluorescence microscopy will be used to record changes
to physical properties of cytoplasmic and cell envelope components in Escherichia coli cells treated with
various bactericidal antibiotics. Additional targeted experiments based on chemical perturbations, physical
perturbations, and genetic overexpression and knockout will inform physical and mathematical models, based
on multiscale continuum mechanics, that classify the phenotypes associated with antibiotic-induced cell death.
During the second phase of this award, a deep learning platform which predicts both antibiotic leads and their
predicted MoAs in silico will be developed. This mechanism-guided approach will be used to identify antibiotic
leads and their MoAs from vast chemical spaces, and leads will be experimentally validated in vitro against
laboratory strains and multidrug-resistant clinical isolates. Leads will be further investigated using human cell
cytotoxicity, hit-to-lead, pharmacokinetic, and in vivo mouse bacterial infection experiments.
A better understanding of antibiotic MoAs and the development of novel drug discovery efforts with detailed
mechanistic underpinnings fit NIH’s public health mission and have direct implications for the prevention and
treatment of infectious diseases. This work will establish a quantitative, model-guided platform for better
characterizing and discovering antibiotics, one which promises to offer a fertile source of mechanistic
information and chemical diversity. By providing the applicant the opportunity to develop his research career,
acquire new wet-lab experimental skills, undertake translational coursework, and receive mentorship from
leading experts in antibiotics, machine learning, biotechnology, and infectious diseases at MIT, the support and
training provided by this award will enable the applicant’s development as an independent researcher.

Understanding of genetic interactions can lead to therapeutic design for individual cancer patients by targeting
the specific genetic vulnerability in the cancer genome. For example, by identifying gene pairs that pose severe
fitness defects when knocked out simultaneously (compared to separate knockouts), one can selectively kill
cancer cells that harbor loss-of-function mutation in one protein by inhibiting its synthetic-lethal partner. Despite
generation of large-scale data delineating the tumor transcriptome, proteome, metabolome, imaging, and so on,
little is known regarding how different genes interact with each other and it is unclear how one can design
targeted treatments based on the ‘omics data available. To address these challenges, the proposed research
will develop a “visible” machine learning framework to systematically understand the higher-order genetic
interactions (i.e. di-genic and tri-genic interactions) in cancer and design targeted treatments.
 The first step for the proposed framework is to gain a holistic view of cancer pathways through combining
the ‘omics data available. Multiple approaches have been applied to integrate data of similar forms, but there yet
lacks an effective solution for integrating data of vastly different qualities and formats. To address this challenge,
Yue Qin has developed a method to infer a hierarchical cancer cell map capturing cancer pathways at multi-
scale resolution by fusing immunofluorescence (IF) imaging data and affinity purification-mass spectrometry (AP-
MS).
 During the F99 phase of the proposed research, by tying the architecture of a deep neural network to the
hierarchical cancer cell map, Yue will develop a “visible” neural network (VNN) that can predict the cancer cell
fitness from genetic perturbation (i.e. knockouts) and genomic backgrounds (i.e. mutations) while providing
mechanistic insights in cancer pathways critical for genotype-phenotype prediction.
 During the K00 phase of the award, Yue will develop genetic engineering approaches to experimentally
map higher-order genetic interactions in cancer cells based on the mechanistic insights obtained from VNN
during genotype-phenotype prediction. The data generated experimentally can directly inspire targeted treatment
designs. In addition, the new data can be integrated into the hierarchical cancer cell map to improve accuracy
and resolution of the inferred pathways, thus further improving the “visibility” of VNN in genotype-phenotype
prediction.
The combination of a computational focused training during F99 phase and experimental focused training
during K00 phase will fully prepare Yue leading her own interdisciplinary research in cancer biology. In addition,
the personalized training plan covering aspects including mentoring and teaching, scientific writing, and oral
presentation will ensure Yue acquiring skills necessary for her future establishment as an independent
investigator.

Copper is an essential co-factor for enzymes across the animal kingdom yet even modest intracellular
concentrations can be toxic, resulting in cell death. The toxicity of copper prompted the development of copper
ionophores such as elesclomol as potential cancer therapeutics. However, lack of clarity regarding their
mechanism of action has prevented their clinical development despite a favorable tolerability profile in clinical
trials. We have recently described that copper ionophores promote a surprising new form of regulated cell death,
distinct from other known and well annotated cell death pathways (such as apoptosis, ferroptosis and
necroptosis). This new form of regulated cell death is copper dependent (hence termed “cuproptosis”) and is
regulated by mitochondrial FDX1 and cellular protein lipoylation, a conserved lysine post-translational
modification regulating only 4 key mitochondrial enzymes. Despite this essential role in enabling cuproptosis,
little is known about the natural function of FDX1 in the cell, and the regulation and manifestation of protein
lipoylation in different cancer types. Establishing a coherent mechanism explaining FDX1 and protein lipoylation
regulation of copper ionophore induced cell death is crucial for any future attempts to repurpose these molecules
as cancer therapeutics. As such, we will combine multidisciplinary approaches that include genomic and
proteomic perturbation strategies with metabolite profiling and multiplexed imaging in cell culture and distinct
mouse tumor models to determine the natural function of the key regulators of cuproptosis (FDX1 and protein
lipoylation) in cancer cell growth and tumor formation, enabling a mechanistic understanding of how they regulate
cuproptosis. Specifically, in Aim 1, we will focus on elucidating the natural function of the key regulator of
cuproptosis, FDX1, in cells. We will take a focused approach to determine if it regulates Fe-S cluster biosynthesis
or protein lipoylation, we will use proteomic approaches to characterize its protein-protein interactions, and we
will perform deep mutational scanning to map the structure-function interactions of FDX1. In Aim 2, we will
specifically focus on the unique regulatory role of lipoylated DLAT in promoting cuproptosis. We will use different
image-based approaches to define the biophysical properties of lip-DLAT aggregates and their protein
composition identifying links to multiple other cellular features. In Aim 3 we will first explore the levels of protein
lipoylation across hundreds of cancer cell lines and establish the cell state associated with high lipoylation cancer
cells. Then, we will determine the manifestation and dependency on FDX1 and protein lipoylation in both classic
xenograft tumor models and in models of metastatic tumors growing in different organs. Lastly, we will use these
in vivo models to establish the efficacy and on-target engagement of copper ionophores in cancer cell models
that are predicted to be highly sensitive to these compounds. Together, this proposal will advance our
understanding of the role of FDX1 and protein lipoylation in cancer and how these key regulators promote
cuproptosis in cells and tumors.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Chemical biology and systems biology operate at different scales of molecular or cellular
organization, requiring translation between the disciplines (e.g., terminology, existing evidence,
new findings) to allow each to inform the other (1, 2). We propose a Biomedical Data Translator
Knowledge Provider for Systems Chemical Biology to address this need.
Centrally, the promise of systems chemical biology (SCB) is discovering novel therapeutics
and re-purposing opportunities, avoiding toxicity and other side effects, and understanding
how small molecules function (i.e., mechanism-of-action studies). Many evidence types used
to solve such problems can also be used to understand functions of alterations at similar
molecular scales, such as post-translational modification and protein-coding genetic variants.
Currently, researchers in the field face major data access and interpretation challenges. For
example, to support mechanism-of-action (MoA) studies, many experimental methods produce
relevant data (gene-expression, protein-protein interactions, diverse bioactivities against pure
proteins and cells, etc.) that are too numerous and heterogeneous to query for most researchers.
Many web-based tools exist to share such data, but they are scattered, not always easy to find,
and generally lack any communication between each other. As the field matures and increasingly
embraces high-throughput experiments, these problems will only get worse (3).
Our proposed SCB Knowledge Provider will mitigate these challenges by:
• integrating and reconciling core molecular data (structure, name, annotated target) from
multiple existing resources;
• integrating and analyzing biological activity data for small molecules across multiple
biological scales (binding, cellular activity, disease indication) (4); and
• providing context for activities of small molecules and their targets informed by systems
biology (complexes, pathways, processes).
Our proposed SCB Knowledge Provider will enable answering questions such as:
• what is the mechanism of action of a small molecule identified from a phenotypic screen?
• which compounds are available to modulate my target of interest, and which other
candidate targets might influence the activity of my target in a particular cellular context?
• given my interest in a disease process or pathway, which candidate targets should I
consider in relevant models, and which compounds are known to modulate those targets?
We anticipate addressing gaps in data by scouting for inclusion additional sources of small-molecule
bioactivity and contextual information about protein target function (see Data
Milestones). We will implement existing and develop new methods to surface inconsistencies
and prioritize returned results (see Methods Milestones). Finally, we propose an Advisory
Committee to help prioritize content most relevant to researchers, overcome development
obstacles, and keep abreast of emerging data and methods (see Outreach Milestones).
We have core expertise needed to realize this SCB vision via 15+ years of experience with
small-molecule bioactivity databases and portals (5-7), plus expertise in phenotypic screening,
small-molecule profiling, and MoA studies (8-10), which demand integrated understanding of
diverse data for hypothesis-driven science. We also made key contributions to Translator
feasibility, including a workflow-centric view of data exploration by subject-matter experts,
identifying and providing key datasets and methods for production of TIDBITS, and prototyping
set-based (e.g., gene-list) analyses in workflows. These experiences ideally position us to
realize a Systems Chemical Biology Knowledge Provider for Translator.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：A major goal of the Biomedical Data Translator Program is to facilitate disease classification
based on molecular and cellular abnormalities. While many experimental approaches exist to
interrogate molecular or cellular processes, few can discern which among a host of potential
abnormalities are relevant to disease in the human system. Genetic variants associated with
disease are unique in providing molecular alterations causally related to human disease risk.
There are two types of genetic associations. Rare disease associations can (usually) be
clearly linked to a gene and are well represented by catalogs such as ClinVar, OMIM, and
Monarch. Complex disease associations are harder to interpret because they (a) are statistical
rather than qualitative and (b) usually lie in noncoding genomic regions that cannot be
immediately translated to molecular or cellular abnormalities. Many complementary resources to
help in the biological translation of complex disease associations have recently emerged,
broadly classifiable as either “functional genomic” datasets (e.g. from epigenomic profiling or
chromatin capture) or predictive bioinformatic methods (e.g. that integrate various genetic and
functional genomic datasets to predict disease-susceptibility genes or pathways). These
resources require expertise to curate and interpret, and there is as yet no knowledge source
that integrates them to interpret complex disease associations. Furthermore, techniques for
harmonizing heterogeneous functional genomic datasets with respect to one another are not yet
established, most predictive bioinformatic methods specify complex data-processing pipelines
that have not yet been scaled to run across many diseases, and there are few if any “gold
standards” to evaluate the molecular or cellular abnormalities identified by these resources.
The goal of our proposed project is to address these gaps within a complex
disease genetics Knowledge Provider for Translator. We are experts in complex disease
genetics and maintain the Knowledge Portal Network (KPN), a collection of open source web
portals and Smart APIs that make integrated genetic and genomic datasets publicly accessible
for >180 complex diseases. We have built the KPN by developing a protocol for working with
disease experts to aggregate and curate high-confidence genetic datasets, building
computational pipelines to harmonize these data and apply predictive bioinformatic methods
upon them, and extracting relationships mined from these data into a Neo4J graph database.
We propose to use the KPN as a foundation to implement a Translator Knowledge Provider of
high-confidence complex disease associations and predicted disease-relevant molecular and
cellular abnormalities. We will implement this Knowledge Provider by (a) expanding the data
sources, data types, and bioinformatic methods integrated within the KPN; (b) developing new
computational algorithms to improve the ability of genetic data to identify molecular and cellular
abnormalities underlying complex disease; (c) maintaining REST services provisioning
Translator with these resources; and (d) developing methodologies for evaluating the accuracy
and internal consistency of these data, further curating them, and defining use cases of them
within Translator. In so doing, we will enable Translator users to address questions such as:
• What genes are causally linked to complex disease [X], and with what confidence?
• What is the increase in risk for complex disease [X] when gene [Y] is perturbed?
• What pathways are enriched for associations with complex disease [X]?
• What tissues mediate the pathogenesis of complex disease [X]?
• What other diseases are genetically correlated with complex disease [X]?
We participated in the Translator feasibility study and contributed important insights to the
project vision including (a) a unifying architectural model of Translator (based on interviews with
each Translator team) closely followed by OTA-19-009; (b) the concept of Translator as a tool to
augment (rather than replace) human reasoning; and (c) the idea of a “Turing test” to evaluate
Translator capabilities. Our expertise in human genetics and hypothesis-driven science, but also
computer science and computational biology, ideally positions us to collaborate with NIH staff
and other awardees to help guide Translator data integration in a scientifically rigorous manner.

Research Plan: Targeted protein degradation using molecular glues - small molecules that bring a protein of
interest in proximity to an E3 ligase - emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy for cancer, especially for
proteins that have been historically challenging to target with conventional drug discovery approaches. However,
the development of molecular glue degraders presents a formidable challenge due to the absence of a
systematic methodology for identifying these compounds. Currently, most molecular glue degraders employed
in the clinic setting have been identified through serendipitous discovery, thereby limiting their potential
applications for targeting intractable oncogenic proteins. To address this challenge, I have developed a novel
chemoproteomic approach, referred to as "Lysate IP", which enables the identification of novel molecular glue
activities in small molecules.
In my preliminary investigation using this method, I discovered that lenalidomide, an FDA-approved molecular
glue degrader, induces ASS1 recruitment to CRBN, but it does not result in ASS1 degradation. Given the
extensive use of lenalidomide in the clinic and in CRBN-based PROTACs, it is crucial to examine all potential
activities that lenalidomide elicits. Therefore, during the mentored K99 phase, I propose to investigate the
implication of ASS1 recruitment to CRBN by lenalidomide, and its role in lenalidomide resistance in multiple
myeloma (Aim 1). In the subsequent independent R00 phase, I intend to utilize the developed Lysate IP assay
for the large-scale, multiplexed identification of novel molecular glues against unexplored E3 ubiquitin ligases
(Aim 2), as part of the anticancer drug discovery process. The primary objective of this research is to
systematically identify and characterize new molecular glues with the ultimate goal of expanding the small
molecule toolbox for targeted cancer therapy.
Career Development Plan: I have created a 5-year career development plan that enables me to attain my goal
of becoming an independent investigator in cancer biology. My extensive background in chemical biology and
medicinal chemistry has positioned me in a unique position to accomplish the goals outlined in this proposal.
Supported by an interdisciplinary team of advisors and collaborators, including Drs. Benjamin Ebert, Eric Fischer,
Scott Armstrong, and Amit Choudhary, I aim to acquire novel proficiencies in a range of areas including large-
scale chemical screenings, mass spectrometry, omics-scale data analysis and visualization, and comprehensive
cancer biology. Additionally, with institutional support from the Broad Institute, as well as through formal
coursework and training, I will establish an independent, cancer-oriented drug discovery program with the goal
of expanding the range of druggable proteins using small molecules.

Chronic Toxoplasma gondii infections are widespread and their reactivation can cause life-threatening disease in
immunocompromised individuals and recurrent ocular lesions in the immunocompetent. The recently identified
master regulator of chronic differentiation, BFD1, provides an unprecedented opportunity to investigate the
molecular events that establish and maintain chronic T. gondii infections. BFD1 is necessary for chronic
differentiation in cell culture and in mouse models of infection, and its expression is sufficient to induce chronic
differentiation. Consistent with a sustained requirement for BFD1 during chronic stage maintenance, the
differentiation program is reversed upon conditional down-regulation of BFD1. Preliminary results indicate that BFD1
is post-transcriptionally controlled through its 5′ UTR, leading to the hypothesis that translational regulation of BFD1
is fundamental to the development and maintenance of chronic T. gondii stages. This proposal seeks to integrate
BFD1 into a broader regulatory network through three complementary aims. Aim 1 will examine the sequence
elements, secondary RNA structures, and ribosomal occupancy dynamics that mediate BFD1 translational
regulation. Aim 2 will use conditional depletion of BFD1 to characterize transcriptional and proteomic changes that
mediate reactivation, and the molecular circuits that maintain the differentiated state. Finally, Aim 3 will extend the
regulatory pathways that control differentiation by screening for genes involved in the translational regulation of BFD1
and further examining the function of transcription factors directly regulated by BFD1. The overarching goal of this
comprehensive analysis is to understand the conditions that promote chronic differentiation and license the
development of curative therapies against toxoplasmosis.

Apicomplexan parasites include the etiologic agents of many widespread infections of humans and livestock,
such as malaria and toxoplasmosis. These diseases are caused by destruction of the host tissues in which the
parasites replicate. Because apicomplexans only replicate inside host cells, the process of invasion is critical to
their survival and pathogenesis. Invasion is mediated by the release of proteins from specialized secretory
organelles at the apical end of the parasite, the micronemes and rhoptries. Microneme proteins include
adhesins that support parasite motility and are therefore secreted as soon as parasites emerge from replication
and start migrating towards new host cells to infect. Rhoptries, by contrast, secrete their contents only upon
host cell recognition once parasites have committed to invasion. Evidence suggests that the release of rhoptry
contents depends on the prior secretion of microneme proteins; however, the molecular events that link these
two processes are unknown. Based on a genome-wide screen in the model apicomplexan Toxoplasma gondii,
our lab recently identified a conserved microneme protein necessary for invasion of human cells, which we
named CLAMP. Our preliminary studies show that CLAMP is necessary for rhoptry secretion and stably
associates with two microneme proteins: SPATR, which was previously implicated in invasion, and an
uncharacterized protein we call CLIP. We hypothesize that these interactions represent a novel invasion
complex necessary for rhoptry protein secretion. Our first aim is to compare the functions of CLAMP,
SPATR, and CLIP; investigate how they oligomerize; and elucidate the relationship between complex
formation and rhoptry secretion. In our second aim, we will identify and characterize host and parasite proteins
that interact with the CLAMP invasion complex. Finally, our third aim will take an unbiased look at the host cell
factors that stimulate rhoptry protein secretion, which may intersect with the CLAMP complex to regulate this
key step in apicomplexan invasion. Based on the conservation of the parasite proteins involved, we expect that
the principles uncovered will be generalizable to the phylum and broadly inform our understanding of these
infectious agents.

High-risk Neuroblastoma (HRNB) is an extracranial pediatric cancer in which up to 65% of patients are
resistant to therapies. Recent biomedical advances have improved treatment options for cancer patients. Yet,
there are no effective treatment for relapsed HRNB patients who have undergone treatment and experienced
tumor recurrence. Our long-term goal is to develop more effective treatments that target relapsed HRNB.
A key feature of HRNB that drives disease progression is aberrant calcium (Ca2+) signaling. This offers
targeted therapeutic potential for Ca2+ channel inhibitors. Other groups have made progress in creating and
identifying Ca2+ channel inhibitors that may be used for cancer treatment. Our group is taking an alternative
approach by targeting Ca2+ signals that promote NB progression that are unique to relapsed HRNB. The
proposed project will leverage the elevated levels of cytosolic Ca2+ in relapsed HRNB driven by enhanced
store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) to promote mitochondrial Ca2+ overload and apoptosis. The hypothesis is
that the activation of autophagy prevents mitochondrial Ca2+ overload and apoptosis in relapsed HRNB that
otherwise might be prone to apoptosis due to the elevated SOCE. Therefore, combination treatment composed
of a novel drug 249 and an autophagy inhibitor will effectively kill relapsed HRNB.
Targeting the mitochondrial Ca2+ transporters to regulate apoptosis may offer a new therapeutic approach for
treating relapsed HRNB and a variety of cancers. A detailed understanding of mtCa2+ signaling will allow
targeting of the diseased tissue without deleterious effects on healthy tissue.
In addition, this work includes undergraduate and graduate student researchers, including those from
underrepresented minority groups. Therefore, this work will train the next generation of researchers and
increase diversity in the biomedical workforce.

Extracellular ATP and ADP are mediators of purinergic signaling in cell-to-cell communication in virtually every
tissue. Autocrine and paracrine purinergic signaling contributes to normal cellular functions such as immune cell
chemotaxis and cell volume regulation, and purinergic signaling also contributes to pathology in injury, infection,
sepsis, and a number of diseases. Notably, extracellular ATP and ADP mediate purinergic signaling between
cells with both short-term and long-term effects. However, it has been a challenge to study the cellular and
molecular mechanisms by which ATP and ADP control distinct signaling events because their levels are spatially
heterogeneous and purinergic signaling can vary significantly from cell-to-cell. Clearly, direct measurements of
extracellular nucleotides are needed, but current methods are not well adapted to measuring fluctuations in the
low extracellular nucleotide concentrations expected in live specimens. To overcome this barrier, we will use
protein engineering to develop high affinity cell-surface sensors that can be used to resolve the complex spatial
and temporal dynamics of ATP and ADP release, clearance, and purinergic receptor activation. To demonstrate
the application of our sensors and also guide their optimization, we will study neuron-glia purinergic signaling in
the brain. In particular, we will use our sensors to learn how metabolic state affects the function of microglia, the
resident immune cells in the brain, in regulating the regional purinergic dynamics that impact local neuronal
activity. The proposed series of multiplexed imaging studies that pair our purinergic sensors with sensors of
downstream signaling should directly visualize core elements of neuron-glia purinergic communication in an
integrated manner. This should provide valuable insight into novel mechanisms responsible for the coupling
between brain energy metabolism and excitability. Furthermore, the genetically-encoded tools developed
through this proposal should be broadly applicable to deeper study of any purinergic system.

High-throughput sequencing technology enables, among other things, experiments that produce
massive amounts of data about RNA transcripts in bacteria. These high-throughput sequencing
experiments continue to advance our understanding of bacterial transcriptomes, including
regulatory RNA genes, which pervade bacteria. However, processing the large resulting data
sets from high-throughput sequencing experiments can be a bottleneck in biological and
medical research studies, partly because existing methods are insufficient for analyzing these
data sets from bacteria.
 This project aims to develop new methods for processing high-throughput bacterial
sequencing data. A robust and user-friendly computational system will be implemented for end-
to-end analysis of high-throughput bacterial sequencing data. As part of this system, a novel
algorithm will be implemented to significantly reduce the time it takes for the most
computationally expensive stage of processing bacterial sequencing data, which is aligning
reads from sequencing experiments to a bacterial genome. While high-throughput bacterial
sequencing experiments commonly are performed on large sets of cells in bulk, recent
advances have made possible the effective use of these experiments on individual cells,
enabling greater resolution of bacterial transcriptome studies. New methods will be developed to
process high-throughput bacterial sequencing data from single-cell experiments. Further, a
computational system will be designed for systematic annotation of transcripts evinced from
bacterial sequencing data to aid biological and medical researchers in efficient and reliable
interpretation of the massive data sets. Finally, since many RNA genes in bacteria act as
regulators of other transcripts, novel approaches will be developed to identify the interactions
between these noncoding RNAs and their regulatory targets. The methods developed will be
applied and evaluated in different bacterial systems.

Mycophenolic acid (MPA) is a crucial immunosuppressive medication that prevents kidney transplant rejection
and prolongs the survival of the transplanted organ. MPA, however, is associated with dose-limiting side effects
of diarrhea and leukopenia. Recent animal studies have shown that MPA-related toxicities are dependent on the
gut microbiota, but our understanding of MPA reactivation in the gut and its contribution to associated toxicities
is incomplete. Understanding the impact of gut-mediated MPA reactivation is critical because transplant
physicians frequently encounter MPA-associated toxicities in clinical practice. Transplant physicians routinely
decrease the dosage of MPA during episodes of post-transplant diarrhea and leukopenia, but large studies have
shown that such actions are associated with acute organ rejection. Thus, it is imperative that we define the roles
played by gut bacterial beta-glucuronidase (GUS) enzymes in MPA reactivation, enterohepatic recirculation, and
associated toxicities.
The overall goals of this proposal are to identify the microbial GUS enzymes involved in reactivation of
MPA and to define the relationship between fecal GUS activity, MPA enterohepatic recirculation, and
MPA-associated toxicities in kidney transplant recipients. We hypothesize that specific microbial GUS
enzymes drive the reactivation and enterohepatic recirculation of MPA, and that quantitative fecal GUS enzyme
assays will serve as a biomarker for MPA-associated toxicities. Here we will study a cohort of 210 kidney
transplant recipients with and without MPA-associated toxicities. Our center at Weill Cornell routinely performs
approximately 250 kidney transplant recipients per year, supporting the feasibility of recruiting this number of
patients that will sufficiently power the study to successfully test our hypothesis. In Aim 1, we will define the gut
microbial GUS enzymes that reactivate MPA and the drugs that may disrupt them. In Aim 2, we will define the
relationship among quantitative fecal GUS activities, MPA enterohepatic recirculation, and MPA-associated
toxicities.
This project will reveal fundamental data about the gut microbiota's ability to reactivate MPA, influence
enterohepatic recirculation, and impact therapeutic tolerance. Importantly, it will assess fecal GUS enzyme
activity as a novel biomarker for MPA-associated toxicities, allowing for the development of more personalized
approaches to optimize MPA efficacy and minimize MPA-associated toxicities in kidney transplant recipients.

Genome-wide association studies have identified numerous genetic variants associated with type 1 and type 2
diabetes mellitus (T1DM and T2DM), many of which might affect genes that are involved in pancreatic β cell
function and survival. However, the exact biological functions and the mechanistic nature of these genetic
variants remain unclear. Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), provide, in theory, unlimited resources to
generate differentiated cells to study the role of genetic factors in human diseases. Of the diabetes-associated
genes identified so far, GLIS3 is the only one (other than insulin) associated with both T1DM and T2DM, and
neonatal diabetes mellitus (NDM). Recently, we reported an optimized strategy to efficiently derive GLIS3+
pancreatic β-like cells. Using this platform, we found that loss of GLIS3 causes impaired differentiation toward β
cells and increases β cell death.
Here, we propose to test the hypothesis that genetic and environmental factors caused loss or reduction of
GLIS3 impairs human pancreatic β cell generation, survival, and proliferation in both healthy and disease
conditions. In preliminary studies, we have created 2 isogenic T2DM-SNP-hESCs, 2 isogenic NDM-M-hESCs,
and 2 isogenic KO (knockout)-hESC lines. In addition, we identified a TGFβ inhibitor that rescues the increased
death rate in GLIS3-/- β-like cells. In this proposal, we will systematically study the differentiation of isogenic
T2DM-SNP-hESCs, NDM-M-hESCs, and GLIS3-KO-hESCs, exploring the generation, function, and survival of
the endocrine cells in the disease conditions. Additionally, we will explore the downstream mechanism of GLIS3.
Finally, we will develop approaches to improve β cell survival in T2DM conditions by targeting GLIS3 and its
downstream pathways. Toward these goals, the following aims are proposed: Aim 1. Evaluate the impact of
GLIS3-associated genetic variants in the generation and survival of human pancreatic β cells both in vitro and
in vivo. Aim 2. Decode the molecular mechanism of GLIS3 controlling human pancreatic β cell survival. Aim 3.
Rescue T2DM islets survival by targeting GLIS3 and its downstream mechanisms.
This proposal will systematically analyze the biological function of GLIS3 and associated variants in human β
cell's generation, survival, and proliferation. It will significantly enhance our knowledge of β cell biology, which
will pave the road for developing novel therapies for T2DM patients.

Cancer is among the leading causes of death worldwide and host-bacterial microbiota interactions
profoundly influence tumorigenesis, cancer progression and response to therapies. Nevertheless, the
role of fungi (mycobiota) in these processes remain largely unexplored, missing a potential opportunity
for developing novel diagnostic, preventative, and therapeutic strategies. Across the population,
colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer type. In addition to bacteria, we recently
described the presence of live, transcriptionally active fungi in colorectal cancers. Here, we preset
further evidence for the presence of active mycobiota in colorectal tumors and experimental data
supporting a hypothesis that fungi play an important role in colon cancer growth and response to
therapies through the interaction of fungal metabolites and virulence factors in the tumor macro- and
micro-environment. We will use novel methodologies and in vivo modeling allowing to determine fungal
species and factors that influence CRC. We will determine specific immune mediators and cells of the
immune system that interact with fungi in the tumors, and pinpoint mechanisms by which specific fungal
strains influence the tumor microenvironment and impact tumor growth. We will further characterize
fungi in tumors of patient and mice to determine the utility of the mycobiome as a predictor of cancer
progression, survival, and response to therapies. The results of these studies will contribute towards
better understanding of host-mycobiota interactions in cancer and might provide a basis for novel
diagnostic, therapeutic and co-therapeutic anticancer approaches in CRC by targeting the fungal arm
of the microbiome.

Background: Mammalian models of cancer have been instrumental in the development of many targeted
therapies. It is, however, difficult to establish these models, such as patient-derived cell cultures (PDCC) and
xenografts (PDX). As a result, most cancer types have only a limited number of models available, which do not
accurately reflect the diversity of human cancer in real life.
Innovation: The majority of the patient-derived models were developed using untreated primary samples with
plenty of tumor tissue. The next challenge in tumor modeling will require much more difficult samples, such as
minute residual tumor foci in a patient with a partial chemotherapy response. Even though cancer is a disease
of unchecked cell growth in the body, normal cells paradoxically proliferate faster than malignant cells in cell
culture. As a result, in the majority of PDCC models, the cancer cells eventually disappear. To address the issue
of normal cell overgrowth, we are creating a tumor-specific medium (TSM) that suppresses normal cell
proliferation.
Preliminary data: As a proof-of-concept, we published twenty-five new ovarian cancer cell (OvCa) lines that
retained the molecular, histologic, and outcome features of the patient tumors.
Objectives: Our goal is to create innovative and simple culture methods that enable the creation of patient-
derived cell cultures and PDX models and develop best practices for validating these models.
Specific Aims: We are working on five major solid tumor types (lung, breast, prostate, kidney, and ovary) and
a liquid tumor (leukemia) to illustrate that our system can be adapted to culture the full spectrum of tumor types.
Aim 1: Patient-Derived Culture of Solid Tumors: We will establish patient-derived lung, breast, prostate,
kidney, and ovary adenocarcinoma cultures and compare their molecular profiles with the original patient tumor.
Aim 2) Patient-Derived Culture of Solid Tumors: We will establish patient-derived AML cultures and compare
their molecular and phenotypic profiles with the original patient tumor.
Research Strategy: We will compare the genome, transcriptome, and proteome of each cell line with the original
patient tumor, existing cell lines, and tumor datasets.
Innovation: By suppressing the expansion of normal stromal cells and normal epithelium, the TSM culture
system can maintain cancer cell lines long-term without feeder layers, drugs, or extracts.
Impact: Predicting drug activity in the clinic has always been difficult using traditional cultural models. Therefore,
having access to biologically relevant lung, breast, prostate, kidney, ovary, and AML cell lines could revolutionize
cancer drug development.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
Telomeres are specialized protein-DNA structures that protect the ends of linear chromosomes and
maintain genomic stability. Maintenance of adequate telomere length is thus essential for cellular
immortalization and tumorigenesis. While most human cancers achieve this through telomerase
activation, ~ 5% - 10% of them adopt a recombination-based mechanism termed alternative lengthening
of telomeres (ALT) to elongate their telomeres. Although the ALT-driven cancers are generally aggressive
with poor prognosis, there are currently no targeted therapies. In human cancers, ALT is strongly
associated with genetic alterations that affect histone H3.3 chaperone ATRX-DAXX complex. We and
others previously demonstrated that the ATRX-DAXX complex is essential for normal telomere
maintenance. We showed that ATRX or DAXX loss, while promoting tumorigenesis by potentiating the
ALT-driven immortalization, also creates a persistent telomere replication dysfunction. We therefore
hypothesize that ALT-immortalized cancers must have adopted special mechanism(s) to offset their
innate telomere DNA replication defects, and thus would be selectively vulnerable to the inhibition of
those compensatory pathways. By combining our unique isogenic ALT-immortalization model system
and customized domain-focused CRISPR screen platform, we have uncovered a list of selective
molecular vulnerabilities including histone lysine demethylase KDM2A for ALT-dependent cells. We
demonstrate that KDM2A-mediated H3K36me2 demethylation is required for ALT-directed telomere
maintenance. Inactivation of KDM2A impairs ALT-specific multitelomere cluster dissolution, leading to
chromosome missegregation and mitotic cell death. The objectives of this proposal are to delineate the
molecular mechanism underlying ALT-directed telomere maintenance and to identify mechanism-based
therapeutic targets against ALT-driven human cancers. To meet those goals, we will pursue the following
three specific aims. In Aim 1, we will investigate the molecular functions of KDM2A in ALT-directed
telomere maintenance. In Aim 2, we will define the potential adverse effects and off-tumor toxicities of
future KDM2A-targeted therapies. In Aim 3, we will establish an in vivo platform to explore the synthetic-
lethal interactions of ALT-driven ATRX-mutant malignant gliomas. Completion of the proposed studies
will uncover the molecular mechanisms and critical dependencies underlying ALT-directed telomere
maintenance and thus drive the development of novel mechanism-based therapeutics against ALT-
dependent cancers including the ATRX mutant malignant gliomas.

Proteasome inhibitor (PI) drugs turned untreatable multiple myeloma treatable, significantly improve the
quality of life for multiple myeloma patients. There are three FDA-approved PI drugs. In additional to
multiple myeloma (MM), PI drugs are also approved to treat mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), amyloid light
chain (AL) amyloidosis and Waldenström macroglobulinemia, the latter two are noncurable rare
disorders related to plasma cells. Nevertheless, resistance inevitably occurs. All three drugs have
serious toxicities. A high percentage of patients suffer from neuropathy, a debilitating adverse effect
from two peptide boronate based PI drugs, bortezomib and ixazomib. Another PI drug carfilzomib also
has cardiovascular and renal toxicity. Notably, none of the PI drugs showed little clinical benefits in
treating patients with solid tumors in numerous clinical trials. Studies have shown that upon treatment
with PIs, a transcription factor NRF1 will be activated to express more proteasomes that renders PI
drugs less or non-effective. Recent studies show that when chymotryptic β5 and tryptic β2 of the
proteasomes are simultaneously inhibited, NRF1, instead of activation, forms aggregated, disarming the
ability of tumor cells to resist apoptotic stress induced from proteasome inhibition. Because of the
striking difference between the “chymotryptic” proteolytic preference of β5 to cleave after hydrophobic
residues and the “tryptic” preference of β2 to cleave after basic residues, it is challenging to develop
inhibitors that can target both β2 and β5 with similar potency. Besides, such β5β2 targeting inhibitors
would also have to spare the “acidic” β1 active subunit to avoid nonspecific cytotoxicity. No such
inhibitors have been reported in peptide boronate and peptide epoxyketone classes. There are three
known β5β2-inhibitors in other classes, all of them irreversible, carrying unpredictable toxicities. We
have now designed and characterized a group of macrocyclic peptide boronates that simultaneously
inhibit β5 and β2, but not β1. These compounds elicit markedly less NRF1 activation in triple negative
breast cancer cells (TNBC) than BTZ. We now aim to continue our team approach to advance the
structure-guided development of β5β2 inhibitors for cancer treatment by improving their specificity and
pharmaceutical properties and evaluate their in vitro anticancer activity and in vivo efficacy in animal
models of TNBC. In Aim 1 of this proposal, we will conduct structure-guided lead optimization to improve
β5β2-inhibitors’ potency, specificity and pharmacokinetic properties. In Aim 2, we will test β5β2-
inhibitors' cytotoxicity against breast cancer line cells. Aim 3 will test the efficacy of β5β2-inhibitors in in
animal models of TNBC.

Eradicating HIV from infected individuals is obstructed by the formation of a reservoir of persistent infected cells;
eliminating this reservoir could allow a cure for HIV infection. Recent research provides clues to approaches for
reservoir eradication. Rare, infected individuals, termed elite controllers (EC), control HIV without treatment with
antiretroviral medications. Analysis of HIV reservoirs in these individuals supports a model in which most
efficiently expressed HIV proviruses have been eliminated. Thus, integration sites of proviruses from ECs are
found enriched in genomic regions associated with heterochromatin and transcriptional repression. This overall
pattern is, however, violated by some clonally expanded infected cells with genic integrations that show ongoing
viral transcription. It has been suggested that these clones may have pro-survival and/or immune resistance
characteristics, but this remains poorly understood. Our team has shown that the above features can be
recapitulated by the application of CD8+ T-cell pressure in a novel mouse model of long-term infection, termed
the Participant Derived Xenograft (PDX) model. For this, T-cells are obtained from ECs and separated into
fractions. Naïve T cells are removed, which eliminates graft-versus-host disease upon transplantation into mice.
CD4+ memory T cells are transplanted into immunodeficient mice, then HIV is introduced. Autologous CD8+ T-
cells are introduced or not in controls, allowing experimental assessment of CD8+ T-cell pressure. In preliminary
data, in the presence of CD8+ T-cells, the selected proviral population is smaller and viral loads lower. Advanced
sequencing of integration site distributions shows larger clone sizes in the presence of CD8+ T-cell pressure,
and multiple features paralleling results in ECs, such as favored integration outside transcription units, integration
in reverse orientation relative to host transcription, and favored integration in more heterochromatic nuclear
compartments to name a few. Thus, we propose to use the PDX model, advanced integration site analysis, and
further tools to address the following Specific Aims: Aim 1. To define in high resolution the integration site
features that enable the persistence of HIV proviruses under extended in vivo selection by CD8+ T-cells and
compare the effects of diverse approach to enhancing this pressure. We will test multiple interventions in the
PDX model to increase CD8+ T-cell pressure, reverse latency or block its establishment, and characterize in
detail the molecular correlates. Aim 2. To train and validate multivariate statistical models to quantify the degree
of CD8+ T-cell selection on a given pro-viral landscape and use the models to infer selection in interventional
clinical trials. Completion of this study will thus provide advanced tools for quantifying CD8+ T-cell pressure on
populations of integrated HIV proviruses, rich information on the functions of latency and immune modulators in
the PDX model and in human trials, and an evaluation of the novel hypothesis that HIV insertional mutagenesis
can confer resistance to CD8+ T-cell-mediated killing.

 The human intestinal tract supports a complex microbial environment consisting of bacterial (or
microbiota) and fungal (or mycobiota) constituents. Although the role of each of these communities has been a
subject of multiple studies, the role of transkingdom interactions between fungi and bacteria in shaping host
immunity and physiology has been much less explored. The chemical basis for such interactions, critical for the
rational design of mechanistic studies with regards to host immunity and disease development, remain
completely uncharted territory in the literature. We have established a genetic manipulation pipeline to identify
gene transfer methodology and build a genetic tool for nonmodel human gut bacteria on a large scale. Via a
multifactorial optimization of their conjugation/transformation conditions and targeting bacterial conserved 16s
rRNA genes, this pipeline efficiently identified the gene transfer methods for multiple nonmodel gut bacterial
commensals and set up CRISPR-based or gene insertion tools in multiple of them. This library of genetically
targetable microbes comes from 5 different phyla. This genetic manipulation pipeline and this library of tractable
commensals will facilitate our investigation of trans-kingdom microbiota-mycobiota interactions at the molecular
level. A high throughput screening of bacterial metabolite libraries from gut bacteria identified metabolites with
direct effect on intestinal mycobiota. We identified bacterial species and corresponding gene clusters responsible
for the production of these metabolites. Our preliminary data suggest strong ties and specific molecular
interactions between fungi and bacteria in the gut that have previously unappreciated role in microbial dynamics,
metabolite production and immunity. We will utilize such bacterial strains and isogenic mutants in key
biosynthetic pathways to target metabolites with mycobiota modulatory properties. We will use several mouse
models and synthetic microbial communities to define the role of trans kingdom interaction between bacteria and
fungi in modulating host immunity and colonization resistance in the gut. We hypothesize that metabolites from
the human bacterial microbiota modulate the fungal communities in the gut to affect microbial composition, the
microbiome function and immunity. In addition to revealing novel mechanisms of fungal-bacterial interaction at
an unprecedented small molecule level, the results of this proposed investigation will illuminate potential new
strategies for targeting of fungal pathogens

Every day ~50 billion cells undergo apoptosis, or programmed cell death. Efficient recognition and clearance of
these cells is critical for tissue homeostasis in physiology and for its recovery following disease. Initiation of the
apoptotic cascade triggers activation of phospholipid scramblases that externalize the lipid phosphatidylserine
(PS) in the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane. Recognition of PS by dedicated receptors (PSRs) on immune
cells is the first and critical step in the clearance of apoptotic cells. Immune cells with activated PSRs create an
immunosuppressive environment that can be exploited by pathogens exposing PS in an immune-camouflage
strategy called apoptotic mimicry. Recent studies implicated members of the XKR protein family in apoptotic
scrambling. Dysfunction of XKR proteins results in an inflammatory environment and autoimmune disorders
while their uncontrolled activation favors oncogenesis and facilitate viral entry. Thus, it is critical to elucidate the
molecular mechanisms of XKR function and regulation to understand their physiological roles and their
association with pathology. Currently, only structures of non-functional XKR proteins are available, hindering our
understanding of how these protein mediate PS externalization. In preliminary experiments we show that two
XKR homologues, CED-8 from C. elegans and human XKR4, scramble lipids. Using cryogenic electron
microscopy, we determined the 3.55 Å resolution structure of hXKR4 in a novel, likely active conformation,
providing insights into a potential mechanism for lipid transport. In our 1st aim, we propose to determine the
structures of hXKR4 and CED-8 in different conformations and functional states to determine the molecular
bases of XKR activation. We will use our newly developed biochemical assays to probe and elucidate the
functional implications of these structures. The physiological implications of these mechanisms will be tested in
cell-based measurements. Our 2nd aim is to determine how XKR proteins scramble their surrounding membrane
lipids. Using cryoEM we will directly visualize the hXKR4 and CED-8 scramblases in the context of a membrane
to determine how they interact with and remodel the surrounding bilayer to enable lipid scrambling. Furthermore,
we will investigate how changes in the physicochemical properties of the membrane support different functional
states of these proteins. Our 3rd aim is to elucidate the regulatory mechanisms of XKR activity. Using in vitro
and cell-based functional assays, we will determine whether and how hXKR4 and CED-8 are directly regulated
by cellular factors, such as processing by apoptotic caspases, phosphorylation, or interactions with of a peptide
derived from the nuclear DNA repair protein XRCC4. Collectively, our studies will lay the foundation for future
investigations of the molecular underpinnings of the XKR scramblases in vivo.

Though significant epidemiological evidence highlights the significantly worse outcomes for HIV and tuberculosis
(TB) co-infections, the mechanisms underlying this increased risk have not been identified. This is particularly
important since all-cause mortality is four times higher for people living with HIV (PLHIV) that also have a history
of active TB compared to PLHIV without TB, regardless of TB cure and effective ART. This research team's
preliminary data suggest differences in the HIV reservoir, the latent HIV virus integrated into host cell DNA

etiology of increased all-cause mortality in PLHIV who have had active pulmonary TB.
The goal of Aim 2 is to determine HIV proviral burdens in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb)-specific CD4+ T-
cells in comparison to other antigen specificities. We will conduct a case-control study in New York City where
people living with HIV with (n=10) vs without (n=10) history of TB will have 5 billion white blood cells collected
via leukapheresis. We will stimulate leukapheresis-derived cells with peptide pools and quantitate HIV provirus
in CD4 cells responsive to different antigenic stimuli. Digital droplet PCR will be used to measure the percentage
of CD4 cells containing HIV. We hypothesize that Mtb peptide-responsive CD4 will be most likely to contain HIV
provirus, and thus contribute to the larger HIV reservoir seen in HIV-TB coinfection. Fundamental understanding
of TB's impact on HIV reservoir will have significant impact on HIV cure options in areas with high rates of TB.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：SUMMARY
Tuberculosis (TB) is the leading cause of death from a single infection worldwide, with an annual death toll of
over 1.6 million lives. TB is curable and drug regimens can be above 90% effective if completed but are long and
toxic leading to noncompliance and emergence of resistance. New treatment options relying on novel and
unexplored targets are scarce. The BPaL regimen recently approved by the FDA features, for the first time in
many decades, drugs against new Mtb targets (ATP synthase) and with novel mode of action (nitroimidazoles).
Nevertheless, more inhibitors against previously unexplored targets are urgently needed to sustain the TB drug
pipeline, as resistance is already detected to components of BPaL. Both shortages, in effective antibiotics and
unexplored targets, are even more glaring in the field of non-tuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) diseases which
are on a rise and are recognized now as an emerging global threat in both immunocompromised and
immunocompetent individuals. Mycobacterial lipoamide dehydrogenase (Lpd) represents one of the unexplored
but Mtb-validated targets and serves in at least 4 enzyme complexes in Mtb: in pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH),
-ketoacid dehydrogenase, branched chain keto-acid dehydrogenase, and peroxynitrite reductase/peroxidase.
Lpd is a genetically validated target: Mtb with lpd deleted does not survive in a mouse model of TB infection and
a conditionally regulated lpd Mtb strain is cleared in mice, when Lpd expression is suppressed in either the acute
or chronic infection. This application leverages the knowledge of the chemical biology of Mtb Lpd to explore our
newly identified tight binding inhibitors (TBI) of Mtb Lpd by structure-guided analysis, enzyme kinetics and
binding assays to define Lpd binding site features responsible for tight binding interactions and extensions of the
on-target residence time (t1/2). We aim to define what drives antibacterial activity of Lpd TBI, how t1/2 contributes
to whole cell activity and selectivity, and how we can design/predict better analogs with improved t1/2 to enable
further efficacy improvements. We will develop a framework for progression of TBIs from an isolated target to its
cellular PDH complex target and its whole cell activity against TB in culture and during host infection. Extension
of those studies to NTM pathogens and testing against Mycobacterium avium and M. abscessus Lpd orthologs
will lead to scaffold progression and SAR development of a novel whole cell active inhibitor of NTM. Collectively
our studies will explore the SAR of Lpd TBI in vitro, define vulnerability of mycobacterial Lpd to chemical inhibition
in vivo, advance our understanding of ways to improve inhibitors' efficacy through its target's t1/2, contribute to
rational prediction of in vivo efficacy and characterize structural features of mycobacterial PDH that define its
distinct macromolecular organization and sustain its functional diversity.

The aging vasculature and associated inflammation converge as a powerful force to cause two of the most
common cardiovascular conditions in older adults aged at least 75 years—heart failure with preserved ejection
fraction (HFpEF) and acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Despite the negative impact of HFpEF and AMI on
morbidity and mortality among older adults, there are no evidence-based strategies to prevent HFpEF and
AMI among older adults. There is a strong biologic rationale that statins could prevent HFpEF and/or AMI
events, given their capacity to mitigate endothelial dysfunction, suppress inflammation, and prevent ischemia.
However, no randomized controlled trial (RCT) to date has examined whether statins can prevent incident
HFpEF and/or AMI events in adults aged at least 75 years—the subpopulation at greatest risk for these events.
The objectives of this proposal are: (1) To determine whether statins prevent incident HFpEF hospitalizations
in older adults; (2) To determine whether statins prevent AMI events in older adults; (3) To determine the
impact of relying on diagnosis codes to identify HFpEF and AMI. This project is an ancillary study to the
ongoing NIH-funded Pragmatic Evaluation of Events And Benefits of Lipid-lowering in Older Adults
(PREVENTABLE) RCT, which is examining the risks and benefits of statins in adults aged at least 75 years.
Given its size (N~20,000), duration (~4 years follow-up), and study design (double-blinded, placebo-controlled,
randomized trial), PREVENTABLE offers an unprecedented opportunity to examine whether statins prevent
incident HFpEF and/or AMI events. However, the parent RCT’s reliance on diagnosis codes to ascertain
cardiovascular events will not allow detailed insights into HFpEF or AMI given the inherent limitations of
diagnosis codes to detect these events. This ancillary study will directly overcome this limitation by adding
expert-adjudicated outcomes through medical record review. This study will address a huge unmet clinical
need with high likelihood of informing clinical practice, and extend the impact of PREVENTABLE with minimal
additional burden on study sites or participants. Our team is uniquely qualified to carry out this proposed study
given our extensive experience with medical record retrieval on a national scale and with cardiovascular event
adjudication; and expertise in cardiovascular epidemiology, HFpEF, AMI, geriatric cardiology, and clinical trial
biostatistics. The long-term goal of this research is to identify prevention strategies for two of the most common
cardiovascular events among older adults. The expected outcomes of the proposed research are 1) potential
guideline-altering evidence on the effect of statins on incident HFpEF and AMI in older adults; and 2)
foundational data for optimizing the use of diagnosis codes for clinical, administrative, and research purposes
for studies of HF and AMI. This research directly addresses NHLBI Strategic Vision Objective 5 to “develop
and optimize novel… therapeutic strategies to prevent… diseases.”

The gastrointestinal tract is colonized by trillions of normally beneficial microbes (termed the microbiota), as well
as serves as an entry site for pathogens. Therefore, the intestinal immune system must remain tolerant to foreign
non-harmful stimuli meanwhile provide protection against infections. Accumulating evidence indicates that a
dysregulated immune response in the intestine is causally associated with infectious, inflammatory, and
metabolic diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Despite these advances, the cellular and
molecular mechanisms controlling protective versus inflammatory properties of immune responses within the
intestine remain incompletely defined. The long-term goal of the candidate is to investigate how diverse immune
and stromal cells are regulated to promote health and homeostasis in the mammalian intestine. The candidate’s
recent work identified a novel transcription factor that is expressed by group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s) and
specifically restrains the proinflammatory properties of ILC3s to promote intestinal health and protect against
inflammation (Zhou et al., Nature, 2022). Based on this and new preliminary data, the candidate hypothesizes
that this transcriptional regulator is an essential immune modulator limiting tissue inflammation and promoting
intestinal health by acting across distinct cell types. The objectives of this proposal are to understand the
regulation and functions of this transcription factor in intestinal health and inflammation across distinct cell types.
Aim 1 will identify the direct targets of this transcription factor and how it regulates intestinal immunity. Aim 2
will investigate its functional significance in inflammation and dissect the molecular mechanisms by which it
controls intestinal inflammation. Aim 3 will determine the upstream signals that modulate expression of this
transcription factor, assess the impacts of intestinal inflammation on gene expression, and interrogate the
physiological consequences of these context-dependent expression alterations in intestinal health and
inflammation. The results from this proposal will advance our understanding of essential pathways that shape
mucosal immunity and impact the pathogenesis of IBD, which could provoke the development of novel
therapeutic strategies targeting this transcriptional regulator or downstream mediators in inflammatory disorders
of the gut. Career goals of the candidate are to become an independent investigator at an academic institute
studying the cellular and molecular mechanisms that promote intestinal health. To fulfil these scientific and career
goals, the candidate has support from a multidisciplinary advisory team with extensive experience on areas
related to the proposed research and mentoring trainees to independence. The candidate has developed a plan
to acquire necessary technique skills, advance scientific writing and communication skills, and enhance
laboratory management and mentoring abilities during the K99 phase. This K99/R00 Award will permit an
outstanding training opportunity, allow the candidate to successfully complete the proposed novel research, and
flourish as an independent scientist focusing on mucosal immunity and gastrointestinal health.

Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death and affects about 13 out of 100
American men. The standard diagnosis approach for prostate cancer incorporates prostate specific-
antigen (PSA) blood test, digital rectal examination and biopsy, and, recently, the Prostate Imaging
Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) that localizes and stratifies the risk of lesions in biparametric
MRI (bpMRI) images. Detection of clinically significant cancer (csPCa) remains a challenge, resulting
in over- and underdiagnosis. Thus, accurate diagnosis and staging of prostate cancer will have a
significant impact on successful treatment planning and clinical management. As large-scale imaging
datasets become widely available in clinical settings, more prostate cancer studies are adopting
machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques. However, the common approach in the
existing studies has a drawback of using imaging findings, e.g., lesion size and radiomics features.
This project aims to implement and validate cutting-edge DL-based frameworks for the diagnosis and
prognosis of prostate cancer while fully utilizing imaging data and clinical scores (e.g., initial PSA
level and prostate genomic score). The proposed project will use state-of-the-art DL architectures
such as U-Net, image transformer and neural additive model to develop frameworks for robust DL-
based prostate and zonal anatomy segmentation (Aim 1), prediction of a csPCa probability map (Aim
2), and forecast of biochemical recurrence using interpretable multimodal DL framework (Aim 3). We
expect these frameworks will offer novel techniques adapted for prostate cancer, unique and
interpretable features from multimodal markers to better understand diagnosis and prognosis, and will
eventually help guide treatment selection and clinical management. This project will build on Dr. Kim's
quantitative background in modeling and analysis of neuroimaging data. During the project, Dr. Kim
will gain clinical expertise in prostate cancer via formal training driven by coursework (e.g., oncology
and biology) and research mentorship. Through the K25 award, Dr. Kim will lay the groundwork for
establishing an independent research program of computational methods for prostate cancer.

reproductive health while providing mentorship to the next generation of patient-oriented investigators. The
training that Dr. Downs offers leverages ongoing funded research in Tanzania in Aims 2-4 (2 NIH R01s and
foundation awards) and a newly funded women's reproductive health research project among Syrian refugees
in Lebanon (Aim 5). United States (US) trainees from Weill Cornell will be supported by NIH research training
grants and spend >50% of their time at their international sites in Tanzania or Lebanon. The projects include:
 1. HPV persistence and cervicovaginal dysbiosis in women with schistosome infections
 2. Genital mucosal, immune, and viral effects of female genital schistosomiasis
 3. Effects of Schistosoma mansoni on the gut mucosal response to oral poliovirus vaccine and gut
 immune cell populations
 4. Implementation science to promote women's reproductive health through religious institutions
 5. Implementation science to develop a mobile reproductive health intervention for Syrian refugee women
Research training will focus on a diverse pool of clinical trainees ranging from medical students to junior
faculty. Dr. Downs has a strong track record of mentoring patient-oriented researchers. She founded and leads
the Weill Cornell Women in Global Health Research Initiative. Her trainees will participate in this longitudinal
mentorship initiative and work in US-international partnerships on research projects in Tanzania (Aims 1-4) and
Lebanon (Aim 5). These 5 projects offer robust clinical, translational, and implementation science training. The
K24 award will enable Dr. Downs to decrease her administrative responsibilities and commit 50% effort to
research and mentorship. She will seek formal training in mentorship and strengthen her skills in HPV
research, working towards her long-term goal of building a world-class research and training program to

The objective of this career development plan and proposed research is to support my development into an
independent investigator focused on resuscitation science, who can successfully conduct mechanism-driven
and patient-oriented research for the development of novel clinical therapies in resuscitation and
cardiovascular critical care. Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is a leading cause of death in the U.S. and
worldwide with less than 20% of patients surviving to hospital discharge and many survivors experiencing
neurologic injuries. Resuscitation guidelines have espoused treatment recommendations in the delivery of
high-quality cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and the evaluation for underlying causes of OHCA. However,
despite these approaches, a substantial number of patients do not survive, suggesting a crucial need to seek
new strategies in resuscitation care. Obstruction of the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) by chest
compressions has been identified as an important factor causing ineffective CPR, but neither the
hemodynamic nor the clinical impact of this has been well-established. Due to its endoscopic location,
transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) can visualize the heart during the delivery of CPR, conveying unique
real-time and actionable data. This K23 resubmission proposal builds upon prior work by our team
demonstrating that TEE can be deployed rapidly and safely during resuscitation of OHCA patients, providing
high-quality dynamic imaging of the heart and major vascular structures during CPR. Furthermore, since the
original submission our team has successfully implemented a multi-center registry with 25 centers currently
participating, and demonstrated the feasibility to obtain clinical, hemodynamic, and TEE data in patients with
OHCA and in-hospital cardiac arrest. Leveraging this unique experience and infrastructure, as well as a
multidisciplinary team of content-specific mentors, the objectives of this proposal are to perform focused
clinical investigations, aimed to quantify the hemodynamic and clinical effects of TEE-guided CPR, and to
elucidate the barriers to successful implementation of this intervention in acute care settings. In Aim1, I will
leverage the existing infrastructure of our ongoing research network to conduct a multicenter observational
cohort study of adults with atraumatic SCA, aimed to evaluate the impact of TEE guidance of CC location on
hemodynamic endpoints and survival to hospital discharge. In Aim 2, using a mixed methods approach, I will
characterize the implementation determinants, barriers, and facilitators of TEE-informed resuscitation. The
results of this research could enhance the effectiveness of CPR, provide the basis for a novel patient-centric
approach with the potential to impact over 400,000 patients with cardiac arrest annually in the U.S. The
proposed activities will provide the PI with unique skills in the areas of pragmatic clinical trials, cardiovascular
physiology, and dissemination and implementation science, required to develop, evaluate and implement
interventions to improve survival and neurological outcomes from cardiac arrest.

This proposal is for a five-year research career development program, focused on understanding how
“neutropenic inflammation” activates the endothelium toward programmed cell death and the protective role of
necrotic cell death protein receptor interacting protein kinase-3 (RIPK3) in this inflammatory environment. The
candidate has been appointed Assistant Professor in the Department of Medicine at Weill Cornell Medicine. This
proposal is a natural extension of the candidate's previous research in high vascular injury ARDS populations
(Price DR, AJRCCM, 2021; ICM, 2021) and vascular cell death work in ARDS (Price DR, Am J Patho, 2023). It
outlines a plan for the candidate to achieve his goal of becoming an expert in vascular biology and acute lung
injury, extending the training of the candidate as identified here and reflected in the mentorship of Dr. Augustine
Choi and Dr. Shahin Rafii: 1. Define the role of neutropenic inflammation in mouse lung injury and human
organoid models, and 2. Determine a functional role for RIPK3 in inflammatory acute lung injury, and 3. Define
important necrotic cell death and vascular injury biomarkers in inflammatory ARDS. The proposed experiments
and the exciting training plan will impart the candidate with a unique combination of skills that will position him to
transition into a successful independent physician scientist studying vascular injury in ARDS.
The acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a common, often fatal, inflammatory lung injury for which
there are limited therapeutic options. The role of vascular injury as a disease-modifying factor in ARDS
pathogenesis has been well established. In contrast, the functional significance of an aberrantly injured vascular
cell upregulating necrotic cell death proteins, including receptor interacting protein kinase 3 (RIPK3), remains
largely unexplored in ARDS investigations, representing a potential target for future ARDS therapeutics. In this
proposal, I leverage my recent work highlighting neutropenic ARDS as a high endothelial stress population to
propose studies that test how excessive “neutropenic inflammation” activates the endothelium toward
programmed cell death and the protective role of endothelial RIPK3 in this inflammatory environment. To do this,
I have developed a neutropenic lung injury model that activates the lung endothelium and promotes RIPK3
expression. In Aim1, we will define the role of neutropenic inflammation in mouse lung injury and human organoid
models. In Aim 2, we will determine a functional role for endothelial RIPK3 in acute lung injury using gene
targeted mice, specifically the endothelial cell-specific deletion of RIPK3 mice. And in Aim 3, we will characterize
dysregulated cell death and vascular permeability pathways in inflammatory ARDS by correlate circulating
necroptosis and vascular permeability proteins with mortality and clinical indices of acute lung injury. Collectively,
these studies will provide novel insight into pathways of neutropenic inflammation and endothelial RIPK3 in
regulating vascular injury in ARDS.

 Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of late-onset dementia, known for the presence of
amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles of hyperphosphorylated tau. There is a portion of patients with AD
who develop symptoms before the age of 65, known as early-onset autosomal dominant AD (ADAD), caused by
mutations in the presenilin-1 (PSEN1) gene. A specific kindred of these patients was identified for having PSEN1
E280A mutations in Colombia, leading to mild cognitive impairment in their early 40s and dementia by late 40s.
One patient from this kindred interestingly did not develop any memory deficits until she was in her 70s.
Postmortem analyses showed that in addition to her PSEN1 E280A mutation, she also was homozygous for a
mutation in her APOE3 gene, known as the Christchurch mutation (APOE3cc). Apolipoprotein E (APOE) is a
lipid transporter that is expressed by astrocytes and microglia in the central nervous system and is the most
common risk factor for AD. Ultimately, a better understanding of how this mutation yields resilience against ADAD
could be a promising therapeutic target for AD.
First, we created a mouse model of human APOE3cc to replicate the patient’s rare homozygous mutation
in mice. We leveraged single nuclei RNA sequencing (snRNAseq) to elucidate which cell types could be
responsible for APOE3cc’s resilience. The snRNAseq data implicated both microglia and astrocytes as
regulators of APOE3cc’s neuroprotection. In microglia, our data showed that ApoEcc/cc+P301S mice significantly
downregulated several interferon genes. High levels of type-I interferons in the CNS, present in both aging and
neurodegeneration, have been associated with detrimental effects on cognition. In astrocytes, ApoEcc/cc+P301S
mice showed reprogramming of mitochondrial and antioxidant genes. Oxidative stress and neurodegeneration
are inextricably linked, and having increased antioxidant genes could explain downstream resiliency in the
patient. Additionally, previous studies have linked oxidative stress to activation of the interferon pathway. I
hypothesize that the combination of microglial interferon suppression and astrocytic antioxidant
reprogramming protect against tau-mediated dysfunction in the ApoE3cc/cc mice. To test this hypothesis,
we aim to determine the following: 1) determine the relationship of the interferon response in ApoE3cc/cc microglia
to neuronal health and neurite outgrowth. 2) analyze the ApoE3cc/cc astrocytic mitochondrial, antioxidant, and
metabolic response to tauopathy. Both aims will utilize a combined in vivo and in vitro approach.

Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are clonal blood disorders, whose pathogenesis is driven by a class of
oncogenic somatic mutations in RNA splicing factors (in the genes SRSF2, SF3B1, U2AF1, and ZRSR2) in up
to 80% of cases. Efforts to target these mutations in MDS with splicing modulatory drugs have been largely
unsuccessful, and there is a great need for improved therapy. To this end, our group previously demonstrated
that mis-spliced mRNAs induced by splicing modulatory drugs can serve as rich sources of immunogenic
tumor antigens. Based on this proof-of-concept work, we hypothesize that mis-spliced mRNA isoforms induced
by spliceosomal gene mutations can also generate meaningful tumor antigens that can be targeted by cognate
T-cell receptor (TCR) therapeutics. The long-term goal of this project is to develop novel antigen-based TCR
therapeutics for MDS with spliceosomal mutations. Spliceosomal mutations are also prevalent in clonal
hematopoiesis (CH) and associated with an increased risk of progression to MDS and acute myeloid leukemia,
and the project also aspires to develop safe and effective immunization strategies for these genomic subtypes
of CH.
The immediate objectives of the project are to identify mis-splicing-derived tumor antigens induced by
spliceosomal mutations as well as their cognate TCRs. In Aim 1, we will predict such tumor antigens by
analyzing RNA-Seq datasets of myeloid leukemia patient samples and performing immunopeptidomics. We will
then validate candidate peptides in vitro for their HLA binding affinity and ability to elicit CD8+ T cell responses.
In Aim 2, we will identify antigen-specific CD8+ T cells in MDS patient peripheral blood and bone marrow and
extract their TCR sequences using dextramer-based single-cell multiomics. We will validate the potency and
specificity of the identified TCRs both in vitro and in vivo.
Overall, the project will (1) corroborate our previously findings that mis-spliced mRNAs are viable
immunotherapeutic targets and (2) inspire novel immunotherapies such as TCR therapeutics for MDS patients
and vaccines for subjects with CH. Dr. Omar Abdel-Wahab, a clinician-scientist with expertise in spliceosomal
mutations in MDS and passion for mentoring future clinician-scientists, will sponsor the project. Dr. David
Scheinberg, also a clinician-scientist with expertise in TCR therapeutics as well as a track-record of training
multiple MD-PhD students, will co-sponsor the project. The research efforts will take place at the Sloan
Kettering Institute, where its researchers have made tremendous contributions to the understanding and
clinical implementation of immunotherapies into cancer medicine. Direct mentorship from Dr. Abdel-Wahab
and Dr. Scheinberg, combined with the guidance provided by the Tri-Institutional MD-PhD Program, will ensure
the successful completion of the proposed project and prepare the applicant for the future career path as an
independent investigator.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB), remains the leading cause of death
amongst infectious causes. While we have made progress reducing TB mortality, disease burden has stagnated
due to our inability to reduce the incidence rate of TB. This can be attributed to our lack of transmission blocking
interventions and the highly infectious nature of Mtb’ s aerosol transmission. Aerosolization represents an
essential physiologic process for Mtb’ s transmission and infectious life cycle that can be targeted to reduce TB
transmission and incidence. Mtb has likely evolved an adaptive response to the dramatic microenvironment
changes it experiences as it transitions from the nutrient-rich lung to the desolate atmosphere. The specific
genes and metabolic pathways that Mtb employs to navigate these changes are poorly understood. In the aerosol
droplet environment, Mtb is deprived of CO2 and nitrogen sources which provide the carbon and nitrogen building
blocks on which Mtb relies for biosynthetic processes. My project seeks to understand metabolic mechanisms
underlying Mtb’ s response to CO2 and nitrogen deprivation. Preliminary data from our lab has identified arginine
biosynthesis as a key metabolic pathway mediating Mtb’ s response to CO2 limitation. I propose that arginine
biosynthesis mediates Mtb survival in the CO2 and nitrogen limited aerosol droplet environment, by maintaining
a steady flux of carbamoyl phosphate, thermodynamically activated and short-lived essential intermediate. In
this model, I propose that arginine biosynthesis is configured as a cycle mediated by ArcA or Rv2323c, a currently
uncharacterized protein which I hypothesize to act as an arginine dihydrolase. Through this configuration,
arginine biosynthesis couples NH4+ regeneration in ArcA or Rv2323c catalysis with the oxidative production of
CO2 in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. I hypothesize that Mtb can regulate between Rv2323c and ArcA based
on nutrient availability. I predict that Mtb preferentially uses ArcA during CO2 and nitrogen limitation, since ArcA
can mediate an arginine cycle without consuming CO2 and NH4+ equivalents. I will test this hypothesis with three
Aims. In Aim 1, I will identify the biochemical role of Rv2323c in arginine metabolism through in vitro and in vivo
characterization of Rv2323c’s catalytic activity and physiologic function. In Aim 2, I will characterize the roles of
ArcA and Rv2323c in CO2 limited environments and measure their contributions to the endogenous pool of CO2
and impact on Mtb survival in air. In Aim 3, I will characterize the role of ArcA and Rv2323c in nitrogen limited
environments by determining Mtb’ s preference for either enzyme in these conditions and their impact on Mtb’ s
survival. These approaches will reveal novel insights into Mtb’ s adaptive response to aerosolization with the
potential of identifying therapeutic targets to block Mtb transmission.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Project Summary
Organelles engage in homeostatic processes to improve cellular health. However, some organelle proteins in
the soma can survive many months, making them susceptible to damage during aging. In the germline, gametes
can be arrested for a prolonged period before they pass down their organelle content to the next generation.
Having damage-prone proteins perdure in the germline would therefore be problematic and challenge the ability
of germ cells to pass down healthy material from generation to generation. Upon oocyte maturation and
fertilization, certain maternal products are degraded to initiate the maternal to zygotic transition in the developing
embryo, though little is known how maternally derived organelles are turned over and replaced with zygotic
organelles. Intriguingly, quality control events have been shown to take place in single cell organisms and during
asymmetric divisions to ensure the elimination of organelle long-lived proteins (LLPs). However, whether
specialized organelle quality control takes places to remove maternally derived LLPs in developing progeny, and
how such a process would take place in a multi-cellular organism remains poorly understood. Through molecular
and genetic analysis, the research proposed in this fellowship will investigate how maternal organelle input
derived from Drosophila oocytes influences germline health of their offspring. First, I will endogenously tag well
characterized LLPs to visualize the zygotic pool of proteins along with the maternally derived long-lived pool of
the same protein across embryonic, larval and adult progeny. By differentially tagging the maternal and zygotic
pool, I will compare protein levels in the progeny germline to assess if it selectively prevents maternally deposited
organelle LLPs to be transgenerationally inherited. Next, I will perturb oocyte health to investigate how maternally
damaged LLPs contributes to offspring viability. Finally, I will identify additional long-lived proteins that are
derived from maternal organelles using a biorthogonal amino acid labeling approach and compare their fates in
the progeny germline with well characterized LLPs. The proposed experiments will highlight how maternally
derived LLPs impact organelle function in the germline of ensuing progeny. In addition, these studies will shed
light on how organelle continuity is maintained between generations and aim to reveal specialized quality control
pathways in the germline.

recover from opioid use disorder (OUD), but only a fraction access specialty treatment or receive an
FDA-approved medication. Community Reinforcement and Family Training (CRAFT) works with family
members to get treatment resistant individuals (Identified Persons; IPs) into treatment, and 68% of families
coached in CRAFT achieve treatment entry for their IP; about twice as many as comparison groups. However,
most addiction professionals (counselors) are not trained in CRAFT or deliver it with questionable fidelity. The
goal of this project is to develop and evaluate the technical feasibility and commercial viability of a
scalable digital counselor training program for CRAFT. The Counselor product would be tailored to
prepare counselors to work with family members of individuals with OUD. It will allow counselors to deliver
high-fidelity CRAFT and significantly benefit IPs and their families affected by OUD by addressing the critical
barrier of access to a leading evidence-based approach to family involvement in addiction recovery. Current
methods for training counselors and disseminating ESTs, including CRAFT, rely on brief online or in-person
workshops. However, research shows this format is minimally effective in facilitating adoption and
implementation of ESTs. A more efficacious model includes ongoing counselor training with feedback and
coaching. This project will develop an enhanced training model for CRAFT and digitize it to maximize
scalability. In this project, we will: Produce the digital counselor training prototype and coaching process,
tailored to OUD - with stakeholder input (Aim 1); Conduct a pilot study of 3 levels of digital training (Level 1
-Digital tutorial only [T]; Level 2 -Tutorial & digital training materials for self-study [TM]; Level 3 – Tutorial, digital
materials, feedback and coaching [TMC]) to establish feasibility, acceptability, and examine the effects of
training on CRAFT knowledge, fidelity, and treatment entry and retention (Aim 2). Validation of feasibility and
commercial merit in the Phase I pilot study will provide substantiation to advance to Phase II. In addition to
optimizing the product based on Phase I learnings and stakeholder input, Phase II goals will include
completing development of a supervised machine learning (SML) automated coding system that will score
counselor-submitted digital audiotapes of CRAFT sessions and generate written feedback including
suggestions for improvement. This will allow us to demonstrate digital training efficacy at scale and commercial
readiness (Aim 3). We will conduct a fully-powered randomized control trial comparing all piloted outcomes for
the 3 training level conditions (Aim 4). These studies form the basis to demonstrate commercial readiness and
value to purchasers.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：SUMMARY
The textbook view of bacterial genomes shows a set of discrete genes, transcribed individually or as operons.
Transcription initiates at promoters upstream of these genes/operons, producing mostly protein-coding mRNAs
along with a smaller number of stable, functional RNAs (tRNAs, rRNAs, sRNAs). Transcription factors bind close
to promoters and regulate transcription from those promoters. Transcription terminates downstream of genes, in
3’ UTRs. This view has been the basis for decades of work on gene expression and gene regulation, with
enormous advances in our understanding of these processes. However, work from my group and others has
shown that bacterial genomes are far more complex. We will leverage my expertise in genetics, genomics, and
molecular biology, to continue productive lines of research on four overlapping topics that relate to the major
research focus of my group: the unexpected complexity of bacterial genomes. My lab has been very
productive on this topic, with 19 papers since 2016 directly relevant to the four themes described in this proposal.
Topic #1. Pervasive transcription. We and others have shown that most bacterial promoters are not in
intergenic regions, upstream of genes. Rather, they are located within genes, in sense or antisense orientations,
and are involved in “pervasive transcription”, whereby short, non-coding RNAs are transcribed before being
rapidly terminated by Rho and degraded. The majority of these RNAs are believed to be non-functional, and
suppression of pervasive transcription is required to maintain cell fitness.
Topic #2. Non-canonical transcription factor (TF) binding. We have mapped the direct and indirect regulatory
targets of hundreds of TFs across a wide range of bacterial species. Most TF binding sites are located within
genes, not intergenic regions. Moreover, most TF binding events are not associated with detectable regulation
of a nearby gene. Our data also show that in vivo binding profiles are often not well explained by a DNA sequence
motif, suggesting a role for other factors in determining the genomic sites of TF binding.
Topic #3. Widespread gene regulation by attenuation. We have shown that transcription of many Escherichia
coli genes is prematurely terminated by the conserved termination factor Rho, either in the 5’ UTR or ORF, a
process commonly referred to as “attenuation”. Attenuation has been described previously, but our data indicate
that it happens on a much larger scale than previously appreciated. We are interested in the mechanisms of
attenuation involving Rho termination, with a particular focus on the role of upstream ORFs (uORFs) that function
as cis-acting regulators, since we have identified large numbers of these ORFs in diverse bacterial species.
Topic #4. Processive antitermination. RNA polymerase can be protected from the action of the Rho
termination factor in a process known as “processive antitermination”. We will identify new regulatory targets of
known antiterminator proteins, we will determine the mechanisms of antitermination, and we will discover new
antiterminator proteins.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
 Quorum sensing (QS) is a mechanism of cell-cell communication that bacteria use to orchestrate
collective behaviors, including virulence and biofilm formation. QS relies on the production, release, and group-
wide detection of extracellular signal molecules called autoinducers (AI). QS allows bacteria to synchronously
alter gene expression patterns that underpin collective behaviors, for example, biofilm formation. Some receptors
bind and respond exclusively to one AI, while others bind and respond to multiple AIs. QS is responsible for
releasing public goods that are beneficial to kin and, potentially, non-kin, and as a result, it plays an important
role in shaping microbial community architecture. QS is now understood to be the norm in the bacterial world.
Nonetheless, how different bacterial QS receptors initiate signal transduction is not understood. Defining the
mechanisms that regulate QS-mediated production of public goods will be key for generally understanding how
organisms coordinate community level changes in gene expression. This is particularly important in light of our
findings that P. aeruginosa QS can be activated by signals produced by non-kin. Thus, determining the
mechanisms that regulate QS progression after signal recognition will allow us to understand the respective
benefits and drawbacks of strict versus relaxed ligand detection in QS-mediated communication. Bacteria live in
heterogeneous communities and encounter mixtures of AIs produced by themselves, their kin, and their non-kin
neighbors. Upon signal recognition, LasR and RhlR activate hundreds of genes, many of which are involved in
pathogenesis and biofilm formation. While some signal transduction pathways follow a linear circuit, the QS
system in P. aeruginosa is best described as a dense network of receptors and regulators with interconnecting
regulatory systems and outputs. Canonically, the LasR-AI complex activates expression of rhlR and rhlI, thus
launching the second QS system, enabling the two QS systems to function in tandem. Surprisingly, rhlR can be
upregulated in clinical isolates containing lasR inactivating mutations. RhlR can also function without its partner
synthase to regulate certain genes. This is achieved via a metallo-hydrolase known as PqsE. We discovered
that PqsE and RhlR interact to form a complex. We will explore the role of PqsE in regulating RhlR function and
describe their tandem role in transcriptional regulation and pathogenesis in AIM 1. The progression into QS
corresponds to a downregulation of certain regulatory elements that function at low cell density to potentially
mitigate early entry into QS. We have discovered that Fis, which is expressed during log phase, regulates the
production of rhlA, a gene responsible for the synthesis of rhamnolipids, which are a bacterial surfactant
important for infections. We will explore the mechanism Fis uses to achieve this regulation, in addition to what
role it might play in regulating other QS genes and behaviors in AIM 2.

Prostate cancer is the leading cancer diagnosis in men (not including skin cancer) and has high survival rates
(98% at 5 years), resulting in an estimated 3.2M US men currently living with prostate cancer. However, data
shows follow up among prostate cancer patients remains a significant challenge. A recent study at Dana-
Farber/Brigham and Women’s Cancer Center (DF/BCC) demonstrated its novel Virtual Prostate Cancer Clinic
(VPCC) increased access to care for new patients by 1110% and expanded revenue by 174% in four years.
Leveraging knowledge gained by the VPCC’s preliminary studies and to address this challenge in the market,
Vizlitics will develop a Software-as-a-Service product on top of its existing Cancer Insights (CI) platform in
collaboration with its research partners at DF/BCC to serve US cancer centers and community oncologists.
Known as VIPCare, this new CDSS will automatically monitor, track, and optimally classify prostate cancer cases
for triage by applying advanced algorithms to curated medical data. The cloud-based platform will ingest and
curate cancer patient medical records, including unstructured notes and apply Markov Decision Process (MDP)
modeling of patient longitudinal data onto published surveillance guidelines. VIPCare will automatically retrieve
new medical record data to keep models current with the latest tests and encounters and then compute a
classification probability for a patient being in each care protocol (active surveillance, active treatment, or post-
treatment surveillance) and the probability of moving from one care protocol to another. In addition, the model
will provide a recommendation for whether the patient should be followed by an electronic, virtual or in-person
visit with an APP or physician. This approach will: 1) improve follow-up of surveillance patients by scaling an
already validated approach, 2) leverage MDP to reduce the need for manual data entry, medical record review
and hands-on patient management, and 3) improve allocation of clinic resources. Phase I Specific Aims are to:
1. Develop a MDP model by incorporating prostate cancer guidelines on longitudinal patient data. Using
retrospective patient data, the team will apply the MDP model to compute probabilities for current and future care
based on latest tests and medical record data. 2. An optimization algorithm will use the probability scores created
in Aim 1, patient preferences, and provider constraints to compute the triage recommendation for each patient.
The dashboard will give the overview status of each patient individually and the entire patient population globally.
3. In lab usability testing will be run as well as accuracy testing of the classification and optimization algorithms.
At the end of Phase I, the company will have demonstrated feasibility of VIPCare, achieving acceptable user
testing and computation model accuracy ≥80%. Phase II will be a real-time test pilot of VIPCare at a prostate
cancer clinic with additional technical enhancements in preparation for commercialization. Significant market
opportunities exist for a tool like VIPCare that can offer demonstrated cost savings, increased practice efficiency
and improved patient outcomes.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
Warmer temperatures have been associated with increased virus transmission and emergence of novel
pathogens and vectors in new locations. Temperature is well documented to have a significant effect on viral
fitness and replication, which is particularly relevant in ectothermic vectors of enzootic viruses such as
mosquitoes. Temperature also impacts numerous aspects of invertebrate biology and therefore is a critical
factor influencing the transmission potential of vector populations. Studies to date which aim to model
environmental effects on population level viral dynamics assume static biological systems. Given the strong
effects of temperature on viral replication rates (and consequently evolutionary rates), the variability of vector
species and population responses to temperature, and the documented role of interactions among viral
genotype and environment in governing transmission, this assumption is flawed. This represents a clear gap in
our understanding of pathogen transmission theory and a barrier to developing accurate predictive models.
West Nile virus (WNV; Flavivirus, Flaviviridae) is the most prevalent arbovirus in the U.S. and the ideal
candidate for modeling how temperature and viral genotype interact to influence transmission and evolution of
arboviruses in dynamic vector populations. There is large variability in prevalence in mosquitoes over both fine
and broad temporal and geographic scales, and this variability has been well-documented in the U.S. Variation
in temperature and viral genotypes have also been documented over similar scales. We will utilize novel
laboratory data to refine predictions of arbovirus transmission under various evolutionary and climate
scenarios, and ultimately to create more informed predictive models that should have broader implications for
vector-borne pathogens.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Distributive Conjugal Transfer (DCT) is a unique conjugation process, first described in Mycobacterium
smegmatis, which is so robust that it emulates the genome mixing capacity of sexual reproduction:
transconjugant genomes are mosaic blends of each parent. Thus, DCT is a new paradigm of conjugation,
evolution, and horizontal gene transfer (HGT)-mediated gene flow within a bacterial gene pool. Our long-
term goals are to elucidate the mechanism of DCT and understand its role in driving mycobacterial
evolution.
We recently defined a three-gene mating identity locus (mid) as critical for donor-recipient compatibility.
Remarkably, one gene within the locus, midA, confers mycobacterial self-identity (kin). If the identical
midA gene is expressed in both donor and recipient, DCT is prevented as the cells sense kin. The focus
of this proposal is to characterize this novel form of kin recognition in mycobacteria, and to determine
how it triggers/blocks DCT. Sequence comparisons of the three mid proteins in other mycobacteria shows
that they are highly polymorphic. We hypothesize that this sequence diversity is driven by the need to
express self-identity. MidA is predicted to have a small N-terminal cytoplasmic domain and a large
extracellular C-terminal domain. We propose a model in which direct cell contact between donor and
recipient would allow the interaction of the surface exposed MidA proteins to sense kin. The N-terminal
cytoplasmic domain would trigger a transcriptional response in the recipient that either activates (non-
kin) or prevents (kin) progression to conjugation.
The two Aims are designed to characterize the mycobacterial kin recognition protein(s), determine how
mid discriminates between contacting mycobacteria, and elucidate the molecular genetic pathways
triggered by mid.
Aim1. Define and characterize the mid locus and the encoded kin functions.
Aim 2. Identify and characterize the genes responsible for kin recognition in donor and recipient strains
by transcriptional profiling wild-type and mutant strains in co-culture.
These objectives will be achieved by employing a combination of molecular genetic, genomic, and
biochemical approaches to dissect the mid locus, and transcriptional profiling of donor and recipient
strains in coculture to determine the transcriptional responses to kin recognition and DCT. Together,
these studies will elucidate the molecular basis of kin recognition in mycobacteria and provide further
mechanistic insights on this novel mechanism of HGT.

functional impairment and suicide risk (MBCT-S/P). We will examine the feasibility of the study design and ask
participants if the found the treatment to be acceptable. We expect this smaller study will provide critical
information for a larger trial.
 Suicide is the 10th leading cause of death. Chronic pain is a leading cause of functional impairment in the
United States and is a risk factor of suicide even after accounting for psychiatric disorders. Veterans are a
vulnerable population for both suicide and chronic pain; however, there is little research examining ways to
reduce functional impairment and suicide risk in a combined treatment. Therefore, this proposal examines the
use of MBCT as a novel way to simultaneously address functional impairment and suicide risk. Research on
patients at risk of suicide and on patients experiencing chronic pain supports the utility of MBCT separately.
However, there is limited evidence investigating a combined treatment that addresses both functional
impairment and suicide risk. Application of MBCT on veterans at risk for suicide who are experiencing
functionally-impairing chronic pain provides a unique opportunity to simultaneously address these interactive
factors.
 The overall goal of the broader program is to enhance functioning and to reduce veteran suicide, and the
proposed project will provide data to guide the development of a larger trial. The objectives of the current
proposal are to (1) combine existing MBCT intervention protocols to develop an MBCT manual aimed at
addressing the unique needs of veterans experiencing functional impairment from chronic pain who are at risk
for suicide, (2) examine if the recruitment, retention, and treatment delivery is feasible and if MBCT-S/P
acceptable to participants, and (3) assess parameters of key outcomes among participants randomized to
receive MBCT-S/P versus an Education control to inform a subsequent larger clinical trial.
 To achieve these objectives, we will develop a manual through an evidence-based, iterative process then
conduct a randomized clinical trial in Veterans with chronic pain reporting suicidal ideation. We will randomize
a total of 76 participants to receive either MBCT-S/P or Education. We will assess pain and suicide risk
outcomes such as suicidal ideation, depression, and interpersonal factors at baseline and after the treatment
period. We will also track participant flow, therapist adherence to the manual, participant homework completion
and participant satisfaction with the treatment.

While vaccines are an integral component of disease management, vaccine technologies remain inadequate for
addressing malaria. Malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum remains a global public health concern, with
more than 229 million cases and 409,000 malaria-related deaths annually. The spread of drug-resistant parasites
and insecticide-resistant mosquitoes has exacerbated the problem of controlling malaria in many developing
countries in recent years. Current control measures such as bed nets, diagnostics, and drug treatment are
helpful, however, together with more effective vaccines that reduce infection and transmission, cases of
severe malaria may be eliminated. While an RTS,S virus-like particle vaccine targeting the sporozoite stage
of P. falciparum is available, it remains only 30% protective in children that receive the vaccine, leaving children
highly vulnerable. Versatope aims to address the unmet need for an effective malaria vaccine by
leveraging their powerful, flexible, and thermostable vaccine adjuvant platform. The power of the
technology platform is based on molecular engineering of recombinant outer membrane vesicles (rOMVs)
derived from a probiotic E. coli Nissle 1917 strain (BSL-1) engineered with a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and
reduced endotoxicity. The resulting rOMVs are nano-sized particles that not only display foreign antigens of
interest but also serve as potent adjuvants for long-term immunological memory and the induction of neutralizing
and effector antibodies that protect against lethal pathogen challenge. rOMVs are stable under refrigerated
conditions and can also be lyophilized and formulated for increased stability at room temperature, facilitating
worldwide deployment. Using this platform, Versatope aims to deliver a malaria vaccine that acts as both a pre-
erythrocytic and transmission blocking vaccine, protecting against both infection and transmission. The
anticipated result of this Direct to Phase II proposal is selection and advancement of a malaria vaccine candidate
that prevents liver-stage infection and reduces mosquito-borne-transmission. The success of Versatope’s
malaria vaccine would represent a breakthrough in malaria reduction worldwide as an improved pre-erythrocytic
vaccine(s) with substantially improved properties over the pre-erythrocytic RTS,S vaccine currently in use.
Specifically, Versatope’s malaria vaccine would feature improved efficacy, longevity of immunity, reduced
number of vaccinations, thermostability, and a lower cost of goods. The new pre-erythrocytic rOMV vaccine will
target 70% efficacy in preventing new infections in infants and children. Together with a 70% reduction in
infections provided by bed nets, this could reduce the R by a factor 10. The combined reduction in
transmission of malaria provided by the pre-erythrocytic vaccine and current control measures (bed nets,
access to health care, early diagnosis, and chemotherapeutic treatment) may not only allow global health
programs to eliminate malaria from low transmission areas but may provide the potential for global
eradication. This non-clinical development and toxicology program will advance the readiness of Versatope’s
malaria vaccine for clinical evaluation and implementation in malaria endemic regions.

Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is the third leading cause of death worldwide at 3.23 million
(2019), while nearly 400 million suffer its effects. COPD is a heterogeneous, multi-phenotypic disease with lung
damage derived from smoking, vaping, cooking, forest fires, pollution, chemical exposure, and numerous
occupational hazards (e.g., 1st responders, military, agricultural and industrial workers). The most common form
of COPD is chronic bronchitis, which is associated with mucus hypersecretion that results in greatly reduced
lung function leading to a decreased quality of life.
Current treatments for COPD largely treat symptoms without meaningfully altering the course of the disease.
There are currently no truly disease-modifying treatments available for COPD patients. Different families
of proteases have been implicated in COPD. Recently, a specific protease has been shown to be upregulated
in lung epithelial cells and macrophages, and its expression in these cells correlates directly with disease severity
in human COPD patients. The target is a pleiotropic membrane bound protein that processes cytokines, growth
factors, receptors, and receptor ligands on the cell surface. Verra Therapeutics has developed a soluble protein
inhibitor, VTH245, that selectively inhibits the proteolytic activity and blocks deleterious activities in models of
COPD. This innovative protein inhibitor has significant advantages in specificity (compared to small molecule
inhibitors), penetration (smaller than monoclonal antibodies), and immunogenicity (based on a naturally
occurring protein sequence). Data generated in our Phase I project have demonstrated that VTH245 treatment
in a gold-standard mouse model of cigarette smoke-induced COPD 1) significantly reduced biomarkers of lung
inflammation and destruction; 2) reduced inflammatory cell counts in the lung lavage to near-air levels; and 3)
reduced mucus hypersecretion. Further, these results matched or exceeded performance of the marketed drug,
roflumilast. While roflumilast treatment is commonly associated with a range of toxicities that limit its use, VTH245
was well tolerated and displayed the highest survival rate over 6-months (20/20 animals). This Phase II SBIR
project will extend our findings from Phase I and provide key IND-enabling safety data to inform future first-in-
human studies through the execution of the following Specific Aims: Aim 1: To identify the preferred route of
administration for VTH245 for treating COPD by comparing the efficacy provided by two clinically relevant
routes of administration, subcutaneous and inhaled, determining a single route for use in toxicity studies in Aim
3; Aim 2: To perform critical CMC activities for VTH245 process development and generate high quality
VT245 for use in toxicity evaluations in Aim 3; and Aim 3: To generate a preliminary safety profile of VTH245
to support IND approval. Successful completion of the Phase II program will further define the target product
profile for VTH245 and provide critical data for an IND submission to support a clinical development program.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
The molecular chaperone Heat Shock Protein-90 (Hsp90) is essential for the folding and
activity of an array of `client' proteins involved in signal transduction pathways. They are
also responsible for many maladies including cancer, neurodegenerative, autoimmune
and inflammatory diseases. Hsp90 inhibition strategies are currently being explored in
these diseases in pre-clinical studies and clinical trials, however the optimal use of
Hsp90-targeted therapeutics remains unknown. This is partly due to our limited
knowledge of Hsp90 regulation in cells. Unraveling the detailed regulatory mechanisms
of Hsp90 function in cells can provide new strategies to increase the cellular potency of
Hsp90 inhibitors. Hsp90 chaperone function is coupled to its ATPase activity, which is
regulated by co-chaperones and posttranslational modifications (PTMs). However, it is
unclear how these regulatory components work together to fine tune Hsp90 function and
also contribute towards drug sensitivity. During the past five years we have made major
contributions towards the understanding of Hsp90 regulation by co-chaperones and
PTMs. i) New co-chaperones: We have identified three new co-chaperones, FNIP1, 2
(collectively FNIPs) and Tsc1, that decelerate the chaperone cycle and facilitate chaper-
oning of both kinase and non-kinase clients. They are regulated by PTMs (phosphoryla-
tion, O-GlcNAcylation, SUMOlyation and ubiquitination). Their expression also enhances
Hsp90 binding to drugs and consequently sensitizes cells to Hsp90 inhibitors. ii) Post-
translational modification of Hsp90: Our work during the past decade on Hsp90 PTMs
has redefined the regulation of its chaperone activity and revealed the reciprocal regula-
tory mechanisms between client proteins, co-chaperones, and Hsp90. We have recently
shown that loss of TSC1 co-chaperone leads to hypoacetylation of Hsp90 and elevated
its ATPase activity. It also subsequently decreased Hsp90 binding to its inhibitors. Our
long-term goal is to unravel the molecular mechanism of Hsp90 chaperone regulation in
cells and regulatory factors enhancing cellular potency of Hsp90 inhibitors. Our strategy
is to use biochemical, biophysical and cell-based assays to decipher the interconnectivi-
ty and compensatory mechanisms between the co-chaperones and PTMs. Our vision is
to utilize this information to dissect the intricate network of regulatory signals involved in
fine tuning Hsp90 function and their impact towards cellular sensitivity to Hsp90 inhibi-
tors.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Basement membranes (BMs) are non-cellular protein layers that simultaneously provide
parenchymal cell-attachment sites and also barriers between tissue compartments. The inner
limiting membrane (ILM) is a special BM that prevents movement into the retina from the
vitreous as such it is a formidable barrier to intravitreal viral-mediated gene transfer or stem cell
transplantation. Current methods to circumvent the ILM involve its physical or enzymatic
removal with limited effectiveness. The consequence has been that successful cell- and gene-
based therapies have targeted a subretinal approach, an effective approach for the outer retina,
but of extremely limited use for the inner retina. The goal of this exploratory project is to
manipulate the molecular structure of the ILM to promote integration of neural stem cells or viral
transfection. ILM formation is dependent on the deposition of laminins, particularly those
containing the β2 subunit. We propose two different manipulations of the laminin polymer
forming the backbone of the ILM: one, genetic and a second, employs a small biomolecule to
disrupt the laminin polymer.
 Our first approach will be to remove genetically a key component of the ILM, Lamb2. Our
prior studies show this disrupts the sheet-like nature of the ILM. We will test if this molecular
rearrangement of the ILM renders these retinae more permeant to cell and virus entry. Second
approach will be to disrupt laminin polymerizing; netrins, small matrix molecules with laminin
homology, are known to disrupt laminin polymerization during normal development and in
experimental conditions. We will produce netrin-induced focal disruptions of the ILM and assay
for facilitated gene and cell integration.
 We will perform our experiments, in vitro using organotypic cultures of retina as well as in
vivo murine models. The in vitro approach has the advantage that we can add back laminin and
reconstitute the ILM and thereby proving that laminin manipulation is the key step. The in vivo
approach is more clinically relevant. While in this exploratory project, we will use murine models
future successor applications could employ more clinically relevant animal models.
 Together, the experiments in this project will assess the barrier that the ILM presents to
biologic-based engraftment therapies. They will determine if specifically disrupting the laminin
backbone is enough to promote engraftment. These experiments if successful will provide a
powerful tool to promote advanced matrix-based approach to manipulation of retinal BMs to
promote gene-based and cell-based therapeutics in the inner retinal disease.

Suicide is the fifth leading cause of death among U.S. children 5 to 12 years, yet limited research on childhood
suicide and suicidal behavior (SB) exists. The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) has acknowledged
this critical gap as a high research priority. A significant risk factor for the early onset of a first suicide attempt
(SA) is a parental history of SB. Although the familial transmission of SB is well documented, research
examining the specific mechanisms associated with familial risk is limited. Our ongoing NIMH-R21 study
(Cohort 1) is investigating factors related to the familial risk of SB in children, 6-9 years, with (PH+; n=100) and
without (PH-; n=100) a parental history of SA. This proposed R01 study will continue annual follow-ups for
Cohort 1 and add an additional 300 newly enrolled families (Cohort 2; ages 9-11 years; 150 per PH group) for
a total sample of 500 parent-child dyads. Youth will be followed for four years from mid/late-childhood through
early/mid-adolescence. Using the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) framework, we will examine the
trajectories of neurocognitive function (NF), emotional reactivity/regulation (ERR), non-suicidal self-injury
(NSSI), suicidal ideation (SI), and SA in PH+ and PH- youth along with contributions by sex and race. Study
participants at first assessment include youth 7-12 years. At last assessment, youth ages will range from 10-15
years. Both groups, PH+ and PH-, will be balanced by sex and race. Two main research aims and one
exploratory aim will be tested. Aim 1: Examine longitudinally how PH status is associated with trajectories of
NF and ERR constructs measured during mid/late-childhood through early/mid-adolescence. Aim 2:
Investigate the potential mediating role of NF and ERR constructs on the association between PH status and
offspring NSSI, SI, and SA. Exploratory Aim: Test sex and race as potential moderators of ERR and NF
trajectories, and on the association between PH status and offspring NSSI, SI, and SA. This proposal’s central
hypotheses are that (1) PH+ status increases vulnerability for developmental trajectories characterized by NF
deficits and emotional dysfunction/dysregulation; (2) these trajectories will mediate the association between PH
status and youth NSSI, SI, and SA; and (3) these associations between trajectories and SB/NSSI will be
moderated by both sex and race. The hypotheses are informed by preliminary findings from the ongoing NIMH-
R21 study, where group differences were found for ERR, SB, and NF. The proposed R01 study aligns well with
the NIMH 2020 Strategic Plan for Research with emphasis on Goal 2-investigating mental health trajectories
and inclusion of diverse samples. Completing the proposed study will assist with the identification of specific
mechanisms associated with the familial risk of SB, determine if sex and race moderate the associations
between risks and youth SB, and provide direction for targeted prevention strategies for high-risk youth.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：SUMMARY
 Early childhood caries (ECC) is the most common chronic childhood disease. Although largely
preventable, ECC affects one third of socioeconomically disadvantaged and racial/ethnic minority preschool
children in the US. Effectively reducing ECC disparity requires a better understanding of its biological factors
from birth to early childhood including identifying differential exposure to risk factors by race and socioeconomic
status. While ECC is an infectious disease initiated by the oral microbiota (bacteria and fungi), the interplay
between host, environment, and oral microbiota affects the onset and severity of ECC. However, to date, few
studies have examined the early-life longitudinal development of oral microbiota in underserved children, and
none have utilized comprehensive methods to examine multiplatform (host and environmental) factors that
contribute to the establishment of cariogenic microflora and onset of ECC among the underserved children.
 Oral Microbiome in Early Infancy (OMEI) study will address this urgent need to understand
biological factors related to ECC among underserved racial/ethnic minority groups. The OMEI leverages
a recently archived birth cohort that compromises 160 low-income minority infants (primarily Black/African
American) and a comprehensive collection of medical/oral health records and ~1760 salivary/supragingival
samples (obtained via NIDCR KL2TR001999 and K23DE027412, PI: Xiao). The OMEI builds upon our previous
work that 1) revealed racial background is associated with early-life oral microbiome development in the context
of ECC; 2) demonstrated oral bacterial-fungal cross-kingdom interactions and their associations with ECC; 3)
identified human genes related to Host-S. mutans-Dental caries interactions; and 4) developed machine-learning
prediction models for ECC. In Aim 1, we will use metagenomic analysis to define the critical assembly and
functional development of the oral microbiome (bacteria and fungi) in early infancy (birth to two years) among all
infants and their respective racial groups. In Aim 2, we will use computational modeling to identify determinants
(maternal, genetic, and immune factors) of infants’ oral microbiome development. In Aim 3, we will use high-
dimensional statistical machine learning approaches to integrate multi-platform (maternal, microbial, genetic,
immune, and environmental) data to identify biological factors underlying ECC etiopathogenesis and develop
ECC prediction models. The OMEI will be the first study that examines the early-life biological factors underlying
ECC disparity from an infants’ oral microbiome perspective. Risk factors revealed from OMEI could be used as
targets for ECC early prediction and prevention specifically suitable for underserved children. An integrated
health disparities research team with investigators from multiple disciplines (microbiome, perinatal oral health,
metagenomic sequencing, high-dimensional biostatistics, genetics, and health disparities), together with an
outstanding internal-external advisory committee, will ensure the success of the proposed OMEI project.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
The foveola, the 1-deg retinal region where cones are most densely packed, is of paramount importance for vision.
Damage to this tiny portion of the retina has devastating consequences for many daily activities as humans use it
to resolve fine details in the visual scene. Yet, primarily as a consequence of technical challenges, little is known
about the mechanisms of foveal vision. A major difficulty in studying foveal functions comes from the need to
finely control retinal stimulation. At this scale, both placing and maintaining a stimulus at a desired eccentricity is
difficult, because of uncertainty in localizing the center of gaze, and because of the continual retinal motion caused
by fixational eye movements, the slow eye drifts and small saccades (microsccades) that humans continually
perform. Recent technical developments offer complementary strengths for overcoming these challenges: high-
resolution retinal imaging allows for high-precision eye-tracking and gaze-contingent retinal stimulation while at
the same time imaging the central fovea, yet it poses limitations in how psychophysical testing is conducted and
makes it challenging to run high volume of subjects/trials. On the other hand, high-precision video eye-tracking
coupled with gaze-contingent display control provides a flexible way for testing vision at the fine grain of the
foveola and acquire large volume of data, but it does not provide information on foveal anatomy. To overcome
these limitations this research uses a unique blend of these cutting-edge techniques for flexibly mapping visual
functions and attention at the fine scale and linking oculomotor behavior, visual perception and anatomy in the
foveola. The overarching goal of this research is to determine the limits and constraints of foveal vision and the
mechanisms the visuomotor system relies on to compensate for these limitations, and to optimize fine spatial
vision. Foveal vision will be investigated from three different perspectives: how eye movements and retinal
anatomy jointly shape fine spatial vision in the foveola (Aim 1), how oculomotor plasticity and attention contribute
to fine spatial vision in the foveola (Aim 2), how attention and the interplay with peripheral vision constrain the
temporal dynamics of foveal processing (Aim 3). By bridging anatomy, oculomotor behavior and visual acuity, the
research in Aim 1 will examine the fine modulations of visual acuity and cone density across the central fovea,
how ocular drift varies in relation to cone density and whether the location chosen as the preferred retinal locus
has an impact on acuity. Research in Aim 2 will examine the plasticity of microsaccades and how fine control of
attention acts at spatial frequencies near the resolution limit and to compensate for anisotropies in sensitivity in
the central fovea. Research in Aim 3 will elucidate how the temporal dynamics of vision and attention change
foveally and extrafoveally and how sensitivity to co-occurring foveal and extrafoveal stimuli is modulated during
fixation. The outcomes of this research may raise the possibility that fine control of attention and fixational eye
movements can counteract vision loss within the central fovea in the early stages of certain diseases, and they
may open the way for visual rehabilitation procedures acting on the fine control of eye movements and attention.

The University of Rochester (UR) and Duke University will establish a Translational Center for Barrier MPS
(TRaCe-bMPS) to create drug development tools (DDTs) focused on the role of barrier functions in disease,
injury, and infection. The overall goal of the Center is to submit full qualification packages to the FDA for five
DDTs relevant to the treatment of: 1) central nervous system (CNS) disorders, 2) fibrosis, 3) musculoskeletal
autoimmune disease, 4) sepsis, and 5) osteomyelitis. For each DDT we have assembled an experienced and
multidisciplinary team to establish reproducibility of biomarker assessments for clinically important contexts of
use (CoU). Each DDT will be based on an existing, validated MPS model and leverage the modular µSiM
MPS platform which provides design flexibility along with translationally relevant permeability and imaging at
the interface between tissue compartments.
The TRaCe-bMPS will comprise: 1) a Qualification Program (QP), 2) a Resource Core (RC), and 3) an
Administrative Core (AC). These units will work together to achieve the Center’s five-year mission while
establishing sustainability through commercialization, collaboration, and resource sharing. The QP will
develop DDTs and standard operating procedures (SOPs) and achieve answer-in-sample-out functionality
through live cell imaging and integrated sensor technologies. Reproducibility for each DDT will be established
in at least two laboratories. Qualification plans and packages will be submitted to the FDA in a collaboration
between regulatory scientists at UR and Duke. Working with manufacturers, the RC will qualify every DDT
component before distribution to development teams. The RC will also advance DDTs to arrayed formats that
are compatible with automated plate readers and liquid handlers. The AC will include an Executive Committee
that will direct the Center with input from stakeholders, including pharmaceutical companies who will define
end user needs. The AC will also manage formal reporting and other interactions with the NIH, FDA, and the
NCATS center hub.
The dysregulated transport of cells and molecules between tissues is the underlying cause of many diseases
and is applicable to the development of drug programs. Additionally, the delivery of drugs to affected tissues
depends on the ability to cross these barriers. Despite the fundamental significance of tissue barriers in
medicine, most microphysiological systems (MPS) do not provide reliable access to quantitative assessments
cellular and molecular exchanges at tissue barriers. By focusing on DDTs specially designed to provide these
metrics, the TRaCe-bMPS addresses an unmet need in drug development. This focus, along with the unique
technologies that enable it, will also make the TRaCe-bMPS a unique and valuable contributor to the
forthcoming TRaCe-MPS network.

Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is the second most common adult muscular dystrophy in the
world with a global prevalence of ~4:100,000. Clinically, patients with FSHD experience progressive
weakness, muscle wasting, and varied symptomatic burden. As adult patients with FSHD age, they frequently
develop difficulty walking or lose the ability to ambulate due to profound weakness and muscle atrophy.
Currently, there are no therapies that have been demonstrated to reverse or even slow the progressive
symptoms associated with FSHD. A treatment that limits disease progression and/or reverses functional
decline would be beneficial to this population. In 2022, we successfully completed a single center (University
of Rochester), single-arm, proof-of-concept study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of daily rHGH
(Genotropin®) combined with testosterone enanthate injections every 2 weeks in men with FSHD. Participants
received study drugs for 24 weeks followed by a 12-week washout period. Participants received serial safety
testing, laboratory testing, functional assessments, and disease burden monitoring during the study with no
participants experiencing a serious adverse event. After 24 weeks, the six-minute walk distance increased by
37.3 meters (p=0.001), lean body mass improved by 2.2 kg (p<0.0001), body fat reduced by 1.3 kg (p=0.044),
overall strength (standardized QMT, average % of predicted normal) increased by 3% (p=0.033), clinical
function (FSHD-COM) improved by 12% (2.4 points; p=0.006), and total disease burden (FSHD-HI) reduced by
19% (6 points; p=0.043) from baseline. While this approach generated one of the largest gains of function in
response to a therapy in FSHD, a larger placebo-controlled efficacy study is needed to further validate these
results. The proposed one-year planning award allows for the completion of all of the preliminary steps
needed to successfully initiate and eventually conduct such a study. Planning award activities will include but
will not be limited to: 1) finalizing the study protocol, statistical analysis plan, data and safety monitoring plan,
and all required study materials; 2) securing pharmaceutical contracts for study drugs; 3) identifying and
securing partnerships with external collaborators and clinical sites; 3) initiating the IRB approval process; and,
4) applying for a NIAMS U01 clinical trial award to support the implementation and conduct of a multicenter
phase 3 study. Ultimately, this phase 3 study will evaluate an extremely promising therapeutic approach for
improving ambulation, strength, lean body mass, and symptomatic burden in a well-defined cohort of patients
with FSHD and will pave the way for FDA approval of a potentially life-improving therapy for patients with this
muscular dystrophy.

 Chemosensation plays a critical role in social behavior among humans and mammals. Olfaction, a form of
chemosensation, is essential for various social behaviors, including maternal behavior and predator detection.
For terrestrial mammals, social interaction is heavily reliant on chemosensory information processed by the
accessory olfactory system (AOS), which is specialized for detecting non-volatile odorants, such as kairomones
(interspecific social cues) and pheromones (conspecific social cues). In the AOS, the initial processing of
chemosensory information takes place in the vomeronasal organ (VNO), where natural AOS ligands activate
vomeronasal sensory neurons (VSNs) through the expression of vomeronasal receptors (VRs). Despite
extensive research, many unknowns exist regarding the natural AOS ligand-receptor pairs, elicited behavior,
and the downstream neural circuitries. My preliminary data revealed that various types of molecules, such as
bile acids, dipeptides, and fatty acids, had distinct levels of abundance in the feces of mouse-fed snakes
compared with those from insect-fed lizards and salad-fed turtles. In addition, the AOS was selectively activated
by fecal extracts from reptiles fed different diets. To explore how mice respond to snake fecal chemosignals, I
developed a layered, hybrid machine learning (ML)-based behavior analysis workflow. This workflow revealed
that snake feces increased risk assessment behaviors in mice that were distinct from other threatening odors,
such as 2,4,5-Trimethylthiazole (TMT). Based on these preliminary data and analytic tools, this proposal seeks
to identify the chemosensory mechanism and associated behaviors elicited by threatening chemosignals from
the snake, a known mouse predator. To do this, I will use liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) to
determine the natural fecal ligands that activate VSNs. Then, I will implement volumetric VNO Ca2+ imaging via
objective-coupled planar illumination (OCPI) microscopy to identify responsive VSN populations to natural fecal
ligands. I will also leverage novel ML-based analytic workflow to comprehensively quantify mouse behavior from
2D/3D video monitoring as animals respond to fecal chemosignals from predatory species. Furthermore, I will
employ whole-brain serial two-photon tomography (STPT) imaging to determine brain-wide activity patterns
elicited by threatening predatory chemosignals. Collectively, this proposal will significantly advance the field by
(1) identifying new kairomone ligands, (2) broadening the range of analytical techniques for studying
chemosensory behavior, and (3) deepening our understanding of chemosensory information processing along
the behaviorally relevant AOS pathway. The successful completion of the proposed experiments will provide a
strong foundation for a R01 grant, including uncovering AOS ligand-receptor interactions at the single-cell level
(Aim 1), examining associated behaviors in high resolution (Aim 2), and exploring the activity patterns triggered
on a brain-wide scale (Aim 3).

Microglia are immune cells that act as the primary rst-responding sentinels in the brain. In response to brain
injury, infection, or disease, microglia rapidly react to attack intruders, remove neuronal debris, and restore home-
ostasis. In addition to their immune role, microglia have been shown to be critical to normal brain development
and function. Although direct comparisons between morphology and function are hard to make, it is clear that
changes in microglial morphology correspond to di erent responses to external stimuli and internal functional
states. Reactive microglia undergo a series of stereotyped morphological changes that grossly correspond to their
di erent immune functions. Additionally, it has been shown that microglial morphology is altered with neuronal
activity, demonstrating that changes in their physiological functions are tied to distinct morphologies, even in the
absence of pathology. Analysis of alterations in microglial morphology can inform studies of neurodevelopment,
neurodegenerative diseases, and the e ects of environmental toxicants on brain function; however, currently we
are unable to ascribed speci c functions to morphological states. Improved methods of processing and analysis
have the potential to remove this critical barrier and allow us to directly link morphological changes with their
corresponding functional consequences.
 Confocal microscopy is used to capture digital images at the spatial resolution necessary to detect the morphol-
ogy of individual microglia. These images are often processed using proprietary commercial software to extract
individual cells. The morphology of these cells is then quantifying using Sholl Analysis, in which concentric circles
are overlaid on the image and the number of microglial branches that intersect the circle at each distance from
the soma are counted. The resulting curves are subsequently analyzed to obtain summary statistics, such as the
maximum number of intersections observed. The majority of these summaries ignore the dependence between
adjacent distances and lack a corresponding measure of uncertainty. Furthermore, current methods discard a
vast amount of information present in both the Sholl curves and, to an even greater degree, in the digital images
themselves. Finally, individual quantitative summaries are typically analyzed separately, ignoring the dependence
between di erent aspects of microglial morphology and thereby reducing statistical power.
 We propose to develop statistical methods to model microglial morphology that fully leverage the wealth
of information present in the imaging data and provide interpretable parameter estimates and corresponding
measures of uncertainty. The overall goal of the proposed research is to develop statistical methodology that will
lead to improved analysis of microglial images and uncover the changes in morphology that are most predictive of
alterations in microglial function.

 Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a last resort procedure for patients with acute heart or lung
failure. The procedure carries signiﬁcant risk of brain injury, yet no brain monitoring is performed, partly due to
signiﬁcant risks of current neuroimaging technologies. Thus, the cause of these injuries, their relation with ECMO
settings, and how they can be prevented are unknown. A critical need exists for non-invasive techniques to mon-
itor brain physiology at the bedside for ECMO patients and for strategies to minimize brain injury. Our objective
is to develop a means to ﬁnd predictors of neurologic functional outcome based on severity of injury assessment
in ECMO patients that can potentially lead to individualized optimization of extracorporeal support and timely
neuroprotective interventions. To this end, we have carefully selected multi-modal monitoring techniques that
can quantify cerebral autoregulation, neurovascular coupling, and neuronal health. To probe cerebral autoreg-
ulation based on microvascular blood ﬂow, diffuse correlation spectroscopy (DCS) will be used. Near-infrared
spectroscopy (NIRS) will provide blood oxygenation and volume information. Electroencephalogram (EEG) will
measure cortical electrical activity continuously, and evoked potentials (EPs) will measure the functionality of
subcortical nuclei in the brainstem and midbrain. We hypothesize that this combination will enable prediction of
functional outcome in patients undergoing ECMO. Furthermore, simultaneous measurements of hemodynamic
and electrophysiological parameters will provide a unique opportunity to investigate disruption of neurovascu-
lar coupling as an additional marker for brain injury. In Aim 1, we will construct several prediction models for
functional outcome based on multi-modal neuromonitoring parameters from ECMO patients and evaluate their
capabilities. In Aim 2, we will investigate whether our inter-hemispheric asymmetry measure of cerebral au-
toregulation, developed during preliminary studies, is a unique marker for ECMO by comparing patients with and
without ECMO treatment. In Aim 3, we will construct a new low-cost optical system and carefully validate against
established DCS and NIRS system. The new system will enable continuous monitoring for future multi-center
trials and multi-regional measurements.
 Successful completion of these aims will result in great advances in ECMO and neurology research by provid-
ing a comprehensive innovative non-invasive longitudinal monitoring tool. In terms of ECMO, this work lays the
foundation for using this tool to optimize ECMO settings and reduce the occurrence of brain injuries in critically-ill
patients. Broadly, this multi-modal tool can be used to understand how the brain functions in diseased states in
order to discover treatments to prevent and treat neurologic disorders.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
 People born preterm are at risk for developing pulmonary hypertension (PH) and heart failure that will
profoundly shorten their lifespan. This is an emerging epidemic of growing concern because conservative
estimates suggest there are 4 million survivors of preterm birth living in the United States, 40% of which have
subclinical PH. The risk of developing disease is highest in adults born extremely preterm and thus directly
associated with their need for supplemental oxygen (hyperoxia) at birth. But how hyperoxia at birth triggers
disease, and whether PH and heart failure are integrated or separate diseases is not known. We propose to fill
this gap in knowledge using lungs of preterm infants, adults who were born preterm, and an established mouse
model wherein hyperoxia between postnatal days (PND) 0-4 causes PH via three distinct stages. The first or
priming stage occurs when the lung is exposed to hyperoxia. During this time, hyperoxia stimulates endothelial
expression of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) responsible for producing the vasoconstrictive peptide
angiotensin (Ang) II and driving PH when uncontrolled. Hyperoxia also suppresses proliferation of
cardiomyocytes lining the pulmonary vein and extending into the left atrium, resulting in left atrial dilation and
insufficient filling of the left ventricle. This is followed by a latency period where ACE and Ang II levels continue
to increase even though the lung is no longer in hyperoxia and the loss of atrial cardiomyocytes causes
progressive diastolic dysfunction. The third or disease stage is characterized by high NADPH oxidase (NOX) 3
in pericytes, vascular remodeling and congestion, and mortality. The high expression of NOX3 in pericytes was
unexpected and may explain why hyperoxia causes post-capillary remodeling, thus distinguishing it from
pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) where smooth muscle cells express NOX4. Building off these findings,
we hypothesize neonatal hyperoxia stimulates expression of ACE in pulmonary endothelial cells, which
persists and increases because of ongoing endothelial injury and diastolic dysfunction, and causes PH
when it dysregulates Ang II and NOX3 later in life. We will determine how hyperoxia regulates ACE in
pulmonary endothelial cells (Aim 1), how NOX3 contributes to vascular remodeling (Aim 2), and whether
suppressing ACE/Ang II signaling effectively reduces PH and diastolic dysfunction caused by hyperoxia (Aim 3).
Understanding how hyperoxia causes cardiovascular disease could advance new concepts on how to best
manage it in people born preterm.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Glutathione-S-transferase μ-1 (GSTM1) belongs to the superfamily of GSTs that are phase II antioxidant
enzymes and are regulated by nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2). Homozygous carriers of the
GSTM1 null allele, GSTM1(0), are deficient of the enzyme and activity. GSTM1(0) is associated with increased
risks of cancer and cardiovascular diseases (CVD). We discovered that GSTM1(0) is associated with more rapid
CKD progression in the African American Study of Kidney Disease (AASK) trial participants, independent of and
is additive to the effect of the Apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1) high-risk variants. This association has been replicated
in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study, and in multiple other populations. While the upstream
regulation of GSTM1 has been defined, its downstream effect is poorly understood. Our preliminary data suggest
that GSTM1 modulates the balance of hydrogen sulfide (H2S), a gaseous molecule that is an end product of the
transsulfuration pathway (TSP) and has emerged as an important regulator of cell metabolism and signaling.
 We reported that global Gstm1 knockout (KO) mice have increased renal oxidative stress, inflammation and
kidney disease in angiotensin II-induced hypertension (Ang II-HTN) and the remnant model of CKD. The
mechanism(s) by which deficiency of the ubiquitous GSTM1 enzyme exaggerates renal oxidative stress,
inflammation and injury is unknown. Bone marrow cross-transplantation implicated GSTM1 deficiency in the
parenchyma rather than bone marrow derived cells drive renal inflammation. Through metabolic profiling, we
have strong preliminary data suggesting that GSTM1 modulates the TSP that is critical in maintaining optimal
cellular function. Compared to control mice, Gstm1 KO mice have 3-4 fold higher renal levels of the TSP
intermediate metabolite cystathionine and significantly decreased levels of H2S, a bioactive end product of the
TSP that could be a factor that can explain the phenotypes observed in GSTM1 deficient humans and mice.
Moreover, loss of GSTM1 downregulates the activity of cystathionine y-lyase enzyme that generates H2S in the
TSP. In AASK, compared to those with GSTM1 active allele, homozygous GSTM1(0) participants with high
serum levels of cystathionine were ~ 2 times more likely to have a doubling of serum creatinine or ESRD. Our
survival analysis suggests the impact of GSTM1 on the composite outcome in AASK is determined by levels of
urinary sulfate, an end product of H2S. We hypothesize that loss of GSTM1 results in lower TSP activity with
deleterious impact on CKD states. We will: 1) Test the GSTM1- TSP- H2S axis in Ang II-HTN and CKD models;
2) Test whether GSTM1 informs the vascular-immune and renal epithelial-immune interface effects on renal
oxidative stress, inflammation and injury, and dysregulated TSP pathway; and 3) Determine whether H2S levels
segregate with GSTM1 genotype and clinical outcomes in CKD Stages 2-5; and leverage our randomized double
blind placebo-controlled trial as an external validation of the relationship of H2S and GSTM1, and to test whether
sulforaphane, a stimulator of Nrf2, can increase H2S levels in CKD patients in a GSTM1 dependent manner.

 Chemosensory systems contribute extensively to social behavior in humans and other mammals,
including mice, a predominant animal model for diseases and disorders that impact human social
function. We propose to study the neural circuitry of the accessory olfactory system in order to better
understand how this system extracts information from chemical messages and informs social
behavior. Without improved understanding of these processes, we risk making mistakes in the
interpretation of studies seeking new therapies for diseases and disorders involving social behavior.
 The activity of excitatory projection neurons called mitral cells (MCs) in the first neural circuit in the
accessory olfactory system, called the accessory olfactory bulb (AOB), strongly influences
reproductive physiology and social behavior. AOB mitral cell activity is tightly controlled by several
types of GABAergic interneurons: juxtaglomerular cells, external granule cells, and internal granule
cells (IGCs). We and others have identified that AOB IGCs undergo experience-dependent plasticity
following chemosensory social behaviors. We will investigate the hypothesis that these cells, and
perhaps other AOB interneurons, are involved in social behavior plasticity.
 We will use multiple physiological techniques to investigate cellular and synaptic physiology in
AOB interneurons that undergo experience-dependent plasticity. We will investigate how experience-
dependent plasticity modulates interneuron excitability, morphology, and gene transcription. We will
determine how interneuron plasticity influences MC chemosensory tuning in vivo and ex vivo using
chemogenetics, optogenetics, and live calcium imaging. Finally, we will investigate the impacts of
inhibitory plasticity on brain-wide patterns of neuronal activation and social behavior during repeated
social encounters. Combined, these studies will fill major gaps in our understanding of chemosensory
information processing, experience-dependent plasticity, and mammalian social behavior.

tissue using high resolution two photon microscopy (TPM) and utilize it to shed new mechanistic insights about
the myofibroblast microenvironment in fibrovascular peritendinous adhesions. Advances to our understanding of
the cellular and molecular events involved in tendon adhesion using transgenic mouse models, which could lead
to disease modifying therapies, are often hindered by reliance on 2D histology sections and single-cell analysis
techniques, neither of which can put cellular interactions or molecular processes into their 3D spatial context.
Alternatively, microscopy techniques such as TPM and light sheet microscopy (LSM) can provide spatial context,
but struggle to simultaneously provide the throughput, contrast and resolution required to map the cellular
processes involved in tissue healing over physiologically relevant spatial and resolution scales and so are not
widely used in tendon biology. To overcome these limitations, we have developed protocols for immunolabeling
and tissue clearing of tendon injury models and demonstrated molecular and second harmonic generation
(SHG) imaging of tendon in situ. Our proposed advances in detection electronics and imaging enable two
photon microscopy two orders of magnitude faster than conventional microscopes and multicolor imaging
at rates comparable to or exceeding LSM. Finally, we propose a novel approach to MV deconvolution, which
simultaneously acquires multiple angular views to decrease focal volumes by an order of magnitude, enabling
isotropic resolution tomographic imaging of tissues. We combine these technical advances into a high
throughput platform for 3D spatial immunophenotyping and proteomics and then apply it to understanding the
complex mosaic of vascular and inflammatory cells, extracellular matrix (ECM), and signaling (TGF-
β1/mTOR) in the myofibroblast microenvironment, to shed new mechanistic insights that could lead to discovery
of cellular and molecular targets for biologic therapies. The aims for this proposal are: Aim 1 will develop a new
approach to tomography using MVD based on simultaneously imaging two angular views that will accelerate
imaging and reduce the extreme computational complexity required to fuse two sequentially acquired volumes
together. Eight channel acquisition will enable dense spectral multiplexing of probes and a deconvolution,
enabling efficient quantification of spatial relationships between reporters at sub-wavelength scale. Aim 2 will
apply MV-TPM to tomographically profile the myofibroblast microenvironment to build spatial cellular interaction
networks of innate and adaptive immune cells within the vascular inflammatory microenvironment of
myofibroblasts. Aim 3 will utilize MV-TPM imaging to map TGF-β1/mTOR signaling in the myofibroblast
microenvironment and subsequently inhibit it to validate its role in adhesions. When completed, the proposed
work will develop a high throughput 3D spatial immunophenotyping and proteomics imaging platform to shed
novel mechanistic insights and discover new biologic therapies.

cells, which is critical for limiting infection. This proposal focuses on two opposing aspects of this anti-viral
state: one, cytokine-induced metabolic reprogramming, which we find is essential for the ability of cytokines to
limit viral infection; and two, the Human Cytomegalovirus (HCMV) UL26 protein, which we find is a major
antagonist of anti-viral gene expression. HCMV is a major cause of congenital birth defects and causes severe
disease in several immunosuppressed patient populations. Our results indicate that the anti-viral cytokine
TNFα induces glycolytic activation, which is essential for its anti-HCMV activity. However, the mechanisms
involved are not clear. We propose to identify the mechanisms through which anti-viral cytokines induce
metabolic remodeling (Aim 1), and determine how cytokine-induced metabolic activities limit HCMV infection
(Aim 2). Finally, we will determine how the HCMV UL26 protein blocks anti-viral responses, which we
hypothesize involves modulation of the activity of an intrinsic immune transcription factor complex (Aim 3). The
proposed research will identify novel cellular and viral mechanisms that govern the success of HCMV infection.
These mechanisms represent key determinants that could potentially be targeted to limit virally-associated
pathogenesis.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Although new treatments have improved outcomes in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), disability remains
high, most patients have ongoing disease activity, and lasting remissions are rare. A major gap
in the field is the elusive identity of pathogenic cells driving persistent inflammation and bone
erosion. Our lab focuses on the identification of pathogenic B cell subsets in RA, which might
drive persistent and aggressive disease. We reported that B cells promote bone erosion by
RANKL/TNF-mediated differentiation of monocytes to osteoclasts (OCs) and TNF/CCL3-
mediated inhibition of osteoblasts (OBs). Importantly, synovial B cells express much higher levels
of these bone pathogenic factors. More recently, we identified a subset of B cells expressing the
classic T cell lineage defining transcription factor T-bet enriched in the RA synovium and
correlating with disease severity and the abundance of SLAMF7 pro-inflammatory monocytes.
We find that synovial T-bet B cells express cytokines influencing OCs/OBs, SLAMF7, and the T-
bet inducible chemokine receptor CXCR3. Remarkably, mouse B cells lacking T-bet did not
activate OCs or inhibit OBs. Based on our results, the central goal of this proposal is to define
how T-bet influences synovial B cell states, mediates B cell-driven bone effects on OCs/OBs, and
coordinates B cell pathogenic functions in RA target tissue, contributing to joint erosion and
synovial inflammation. We hypothesize that T-bet promotes pathogenic B cell functions in the RA
synovium via acquisition of a pro-inflammatory cytokine/chemokine program that orchestrates
CXCR3-dependent B cell migration to the synovium and enhances SLAMF7-dependent
monocyte activation and bone erosion. We will use deeply characterized RA patient cohorts, high-
resolution single cell transcriptomic and spatial analysis of joint target tissue, and novel animal
models to track T bet B cells and selectively and conditionally delete T-bet in B cells of mice with
collagen induced arthritis. The combination of preclinical and translational studies will facilitate
the mechanistic interrogation of T-bet B cell functions in RA via 3 SAs: 1) Determine the
mechanisms by which B cell T-bet promotes RA joint erosion; 2) Assess how T-bet B cells impact
RA synovial monocyte activation; 3) Examine the role of T-bet in B cells during inflammatory-
erosive arthritis in mice. By detailing the functional impact of T-bet B cells, innovative treatments
targeting their activity may be a novel path towards preventing bone erosion and conferring lasting
clinical remissions.

freshwater. Climate change is impacting the Lakes, altering water temperature, pH, storm frequency, ice cover,
and precipitation. Human debris, including plastic, also impacts the Lakes and those who rely on it. Plastic enters
the Lakes as microplastic (MP; particles <5 mm) or as macrodebris that may degrade to MP. There are significant
knowledge gaps about the cycle of plastic in the Lakes, but MPs have been found in all lake habitats, throughout
the food chain, and in tap water. The potential human health effects of Lake-associated exposure to MP are
vastly understudied. How MP inputs and impacts will be affected by climate change is also unknown. Addressing
such complex problems requires engaging diverse community partners and a multidisciplinary systems science
approach. The over-arching goal of the Lake Ontario Center for Microplastics and Human Health in a Changing
Environment is to prevent negative human health impacts of MP in the context of climate change in the Great Lakes
by engaging diverse partners in research, promoting environmental health literacy, and promoting solutions.
Because the Lake Ontario region is representative of the Great Lakes basin, our work will be broadly transferable.
Our innovative approach assesses plastics as they exist in the environment: as mixtures of post-consumer plastic
polymers, degraded by the environment, and covered with biofilm. A major challenge of MP research is
standardization of materials and methods, which we address with a novel Materials and Metrology Core that
supports and is integral to all 3 research projects. Project 1 will holistically assess projected climate
change impacts on plastic input, degradation, ecotoxicity, and microorganisms in plastic-associated biofilms.
Project 1 culminates in modeling to predict future input, fate and transport of microplastics in Lake Ontario.
Project 2 will build on Project 1’s foundation to assess the potential for dermal and lung exposure to MPs by
leveraging nanomembrane technologies to analyze mammalian cytotoxicity and bioactivity of natural and
experimental particle mixtures in combination with variation in temperature and availability of metals and
persistent organic pollutants. Project 3 extends the investigation to the whole organism by using the
amphibian Xenopus to rigorously assess the biodistribution of MPs and impacts on development, fitness,
immune homeostasis and antiviral immunity, under varied conditions of temperature. Given the high degree of
evolutionary conservation of vertebrate physiology, the outcomes from this study are very relevant to human
health. Our Community Engagement Core involves diverse partners in all aspects of the Center, including
community science, direct action, development and dissemination of materials, and building partners’ capacity
to promote solutions. Our Administrative Core coordinates across two institutions (the University of Rochester
and the Rochester Institute of Technology), supports multidirectional communication with external stakeholders,
oversees our Plan for Enhancing Diverse Perspectives, and evaluates progress toward Center goals.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：ABSTRACT
The exon junction complex (EJC) is deposited by the spliceosome upstream of exon–exon junctions during the
process of pre-mRNA splicing. If an exon–exon is sufficiently downstream of either a normal termination codon
or a premature termination codon (the latter of which can be generated by splicing errors or frameshift or
nonsense mutations), then EJC-dependent nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) is triggered. NMD destroys
aberrant mRNAs and regulates the normal gene expression of ~5-10% of unmutated mRNAs. I recently
discovered that AKT, a central cell signaling kinase, is a constituent of an alternative EJC containing CASC3
(the AKT EJC) but not UPF2 or RNPS1 (in the canonical UPF2 EJC). AKT functionally replaces UPF2 in UPF2-
independent NMD by activating the key NMD factor UPF1. AKT does so by phosphorylating UPF1; UPF2 does
so by binding UPF1. I found that insulin-mediated activation of AKT signaling increases AKT EJCs at the expense
of UPF2 EJCs, which is the first example of cell-signaling mediated regulation of EJC composition. These
findings are important because AKT signaling and NMD, which converge at the EJC, are both dysregulated in
some cancers, Fragile X syndrome, and type 1 and 2 diabetes. Despite its importance, there are many remaining
uncertainties about how EJCs are formed, including: when and how the commitment to either the AKT EJC or
UPF2 EJC is made; the mechanism by which insulin increases AKT EJC formation; if insulin increases and/or
alters EJC binding at exon−exon junctions; if spliceosomes are involved in alternative EJC formation; the
choreography of steps involved in core EJC formation, presumably on the spliceosome; and how EJCs are
transferred to upstream of exon−exon junctions on newly spliced mRNA, to name a few. In this proposal, I will
start addressing some of these uncertainties while receiving training in concepts and techniques from my
mentoring team so as to continue pursuing these questions in my own lab. In Aim 1 (K99), I will test (i) the
precursor-product relationship between UPF2 EJCs and AKT EJCs (while learning how to generate and use
HEK293T cells engineered for auxin-induced degradation of EJC proteins), (ii) if the insulin-promoted increase
in AKT EJCs and decrease in UPF2 EJCs requires splicing, and (iii) if insulin signaling increases and/or alters
the number of EJC-bound exon–exon junctions (while learning RIP-Seq). In Aim 2 (K99), I will identify and define
any insulin-promoted post-translational modifications (PTMs) on EJC proteins that promote the increase in AKT
EJCs and decrease in UPF2 EJCs (while learning mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics and PTM
profiling). In Aim 3 (R00), I will apply my background in mechanistic biochemistry and training in new techniques
to build an independent research program aimed at elucidating yet-undetermined molecular mechanisms in EJC
biology, starting by defining which splicing factors are needed for core EJC assembly, which splicing factors, if
any, are involved in alternative EJC formation, and for the latter, whether PTMs of splicing factors are involved.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a frequent complication among critically ill children and is independently associated
with increased morbidity and mortality. While AKI identification remains largely reactive, early prediction of AKI
provides opportunities for mitigation strategies to improve patient outcomes. Existing pediatric AKI risk
prediction models are primarily driven by single-center data with limited translation into clinical decision support
(CDS) at the point of care. While CDS systems are designed to improve care quality and patient safety, they
have failed to make meaningful improvements while contributing substantially to provider alert fatigue. This is
especially true in pediatric critical care, where alerts and alarms are ubiquitous and often ignored. Disregarding
important alerts may lead to patient harm. The addition of machine learning methods to augment decision
support has been the focus of substantial hype, however clinicians remain skeptical over concerns such as
utility, credibility, and validity. Within this clinical context, this application addresses two specific knowledge
gaps. First, without validated and generalizable prediction tools, the best method for identifying patients at risk
for developing AKI in the pediatric ICU (PICU) is unknown. Second, current CDS systems are burdensome and
there exist no clear recommendations on useful, usable implementations for AKI decision support. The long-
term goal of my research program is to improve the care and outcomes of critically ill children with acute kidney
injury while reducing provider alert frustration through personalized, shareable CDS. As a step toward this
goal, this career development award will demonstrate success of an integrated CDS pipeline for external
validation, cutting-edge technology to facilitate distributed implementation, and usability assessment. The
research aims of this proposal are to: 1) establish baseline external validity of an existing AKI prediction model
and extend with new predictors to improve accuracy within two novel multi-center datasets, each with >80,000
PICU encounters; 2) overcome interoperability barriers using Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resource
(FHIR)-based EHR technology and prospectively evaluate this implementation’s performance; and 3)
implement principles of user-centered design to improve clinician acceptance. With the support of my
mentoring committee, I will gain advanced knowledge and develop expertise in user-centered design,
qualitative methodology, clinical trial design, and implementation science in decision support. This work is
innovative as it leverages two brand-new, highly granular datasets to achieve external validation, implements
an AKI prediction tool using new FHIR-based technology, and utilizes mixed-methods cognitive informatics
tools to perform usability testing. However, the truly innovative aspect of this work is the integration of all three
aims into a single pipeline. This work provides the foundation for a prospective clinical trial evaluating clinical
effectiveness, as well as incorporation of biomarkers and physiologic data streams, and the development of
evaluation measures for decision support systems.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Abstract: Transcription is one of the first steps in gene expression, and the many protein factors involved must
be tightly regulated to correctly carry out cellular processes. The Integrator complex, a 15-subunit metazoan-
specific complex, was initially discovered to be crucial for the proper transcription of certain non-coding RNAs.
Recently, it has been found that Integrator is a broad transcriptional regulator with roles at many protein-coding
and non-coding genes. Integrator acts as a negative regulator of RNA Polymerase II (RNAPII) transcription
through promoter-proximal termination and can alter its functionality in response to stress, such as DNA damage
or reactive oxygen species. Despite its critical role in fine-tuning transcriptional regulation, it is not yet understood
how Integrator is assembled and regulated, presenting a knowledge gap in the field.
 Our preliminary experiments strikingly revealed that a key factor involved in DNA damage repair (DDR)
associates with a global regulator of RNAPII activity, thus providing a previously unknown connection between
these two processes. Specifically, the BRCA1-ATM activator 1 (BRAT1) associates with Integrator subunit 11
(INTS11), the endonuclease-containing subunit within the Integrator complex. BRAT1 is a cytoplasmic protein
that re-localizes to the nucleus upon DNA damage to act as a scaffold between the site of damage and repair
proteins. Our cryo-EM analysis of the INTS11-BRAT1 heterodimer reveals that BRAT1 forms a circular structure
around INTS11 and uses three conserved C-terminal residues to bind to the INTS11 active site, preventing its
cleavage of RNA. Additionally, the cryo-EM analysis showed that INTS9 can bind to form an INTS11-INTS9-
BRAT1 heterotrimer, suggesting interplay between BRAT1 as an inhibitor of INTS11 and other members of the
Integrator complex. The goal of this proposal is to examine the function and mechanism of action of these two
unique complexes. To examine the function, our lab generated BRAT1 null cell lines and a rapid depletion system
using the auxin-inducible degron (AID) tag to allow quick depletion of INTS11. Initial studies of these lines show
that BRAT1 loss results in an INTS11 depletion phenotype, presenting upregulation of genes negatively
regulated by Integrator. Overall, these data present a model where BRAT1 could regulate Integrator activity
through its association with INTS9/11. The hypothesis is that BRAT1 acts as a licensing factor, facilitating the
assembly of the Integrator complex and providing precise regulation, which is especially important during cellular
stress such as DNA damage. To test this hypothesis, three aims are proposed. First, the interaction between
BRAT1 and INTS9/11 will be biochemically defined to further probe the structure. Next, the impact of BRAT1 on
the canonical Integrator complex function will be determined. Finally, the impact of INTS11-INTS9-BRAT1 during
DNA damage repair will be elucidated. Successful completion of these aims will provide a more thorough
understanding of the regulation and assembly of the Integrator complex.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：The APOE-ε4 (APOE4) variant is the greatest single risk factor for developing late-onset Alzheimer's disease  (AD); however, its involvement in AD is poorly understood. Recently DAB1 was identified as the only genome-wide significant locus in homozygous APOE4 (e4/e4) individuals in the UK Biobank. DAB1's involvement in AD  was profoundly dependent on the e4/e4 genotype and also the DAB1 SNP zygosity, which influenced the  probability of developing AD and the age of onset. Based on this, we hypothesize that there is a genetic  interaction between APOE4 and DAB1 that synergistically augments the likelihood of AD. Both APOE4 and  DAB1 act on the endocytosis-signaling receptors in the APOE-receptor family and have consequences for Aβ  accumulation and microtubule binding protein τ (MAPT) phosphorylation pointing to potential functional  overlap. DAB1 is an obligate adaptor protein on the REELIN signaling pathway that is well characterized for its  roles in brain development. The Reln gene has been shown to impact AD-related phenotypes in mouse models  of the disease, and in the APOE4 study RELN was nominally associated with AD in e4/e4 individuals pointing  to a broader involvement of the RELN-DAB1 pathway in AD. We propose that determining the Dab1 dosage-dependent, AD-related phenotypes that are exaggerated by APOE4 in mouse and culture models will help elucidate how these genes contribute to the increased risk of the disease. We will investigate this by pursuing  the following specific aims: Specific Aim 1. To determine if Dab1 heterozygosity alters early and/or late AD-like pathology in an APOE variant-dependent manner. Specific Aim 2. To determine if Dab1-gene dose influences APOE4-dependent endocytic aberrations. Our long  term goal is to resolve how DAB1 and other  REELIN pathway genes influence APOE4 biology as a means to understand how this apolipoprotein and  defects in endocytosis contribute to the progression of AD.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
 The ability of the brain to utilize information from past experiences to guide future decisions, termed adaptive
behavior, is critical for survival. To effectively adapt behaviors, the brain applies stored memory to new but similar
situations (generalization), while also maintaining the capacity to distinguish unique stimuli (discrimination).
When these critical processes (memory generalization or discrimination) go awry, it can lead to maladaptive
disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and panic disorder. Despite their importance,
mechanisms underlying memory discrimination and generalization remain largely unknown. This proposal will
investigate the dynamic processes that underlie the utilization of an encoded memory to guide future behaviors,
in particular the molecular, synaptic, and circuit mechanisms that govern the balance between discrimination
and generalization. We have collected very exciting preliminary data showing that individual contextual fear
memories are represented in the dentate gyrus (DG) by multiple functionally distinct neuronal ensembles defined
by different activity-dependent transcriptional pathways, and that these ensembles bi-directionally regulate the
discrimination-generalization balance. Based on these exciting findings, we hypothesize that the activity-
dependent pathways target specific synaptic inputs on DG granule cells to differentially control memory
discrimination and generalization. We aim to (1) uncover novel forms of learning-induced synaptic plasticity; (2)
reveal underlying circuit mechanisms for memory discrimination and generalization; and (3) identify the
molecular players important for this experience-dependent behavioral adaptation. The proposed research is both
conceptually and technically innovative. It will experimentally demonstrate for the first time functionally distinct
active neuronal ensembles coexisting within the memory engram, shed light on the synaptic and circuit
mechanisms by which encoded memories directly drive experience-dependent behavioral outputs, and may lead
to new treatment strategies for neuropsychiatric disorders, such as PTSD and panic disorder, which are caused
by the imbalance between memory discrimination and generalization.

This proposal represents a highly innovative line of research focused on understanding the mechanism/s
by which PHF21B (plant homeodomain finger protein 21B) deficiency impairs social memory. Social
impairments, which may be present in multiple psychiatric disorders, are characterized by deficiencies in
social functioning. Social cognitive impairments are a central feature of several neurodegenerative,
neuropsychiatric, and neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism spectrum and attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder. They also frequently occur following acute brain damage after traumatic brain injury
and stroke. We present conceptually novel evidence showing that PHF21B deficiency significantly impairs
social memory. In the three-chamber social interaction test, the social preference index of the PHF21B
deficient mice did not significantly differ, but they spent more time interacting with the new stranger than
with the familiar stranger compared to wild-type mice. Therefore, their social novelty index was
significantly greater than wild-type animals, suggesting social memory deficits. Social memory
impairments were further confirmed using the 5-trial social memory test. Our new data also support the
concept that PHF21B binds to the epigenetic marker tri-methylated Lys36 at histone H3 (H3K36me3), a
histone marker associated with expressed gene bodies and recruits proteins implicated in transcription,
splicing, and DNA repair. The proposed studies will interrogate the specific role(s) of PHF21B in neuronal
function relevant to social behaviors, specifically in social recognition impairment. Expected outcomes are
to characterize the role of PHF21B in the hippocampus and identify its target genes and regulatory
mechanisms relevant to social memory. We expect that the proposed studies will provide novel insights
into the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying epigenetic changes that affect social recognition
memory. The results to be generated by this project have translational potential as they may facilitate the
development of novel pharmacological targets for social memory deficits.

 Psychiatric geneticists have discovered hundreds of common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
associated with schizophrenia (SCZ) through genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Brain expression
quantitative trait loci (eQTL) can successfully explain some of those genetic associations. Differences in genetic
association between disparate ancestral populations are often reported, however, it is not known whether such
population differences originate from different underlying risk genes or from different allele frequencies and linkage
disequilibrium of the same risk genes. Our central hypothesis is that genetic regulation of gene expression
within brains, as represented by eQTL, can explain the disease GWAS signals. Population structure
influences eQTL as it influences GWAS. The major assumption is that the biological foundation of GWAS and
eQTL is the S-E-D relationship, short for SNP-Gene Expression-Disorder. Functional interpretation of GWAS signals
relies on the discovery of S-E-D relationships. Due to a lack of brain transcriptome data from populations of non-
European descent, interpreting SCZ GWAS results for variants uncommon in other populations presents a
significant challenge. To discover the causes of these population differences, we will develop a transcriptome
dataset of a new brain collection from East Asians (EA, N = 578) combined with samples from the existing
PsychENCODE project (EA, N = 18). We will also use data of individuals of African ancestry (AFR, N = 411) from
the PsychENCODE projects. Along with data from those of European descent (EU), which dominates the
PsychENCODE (N =1,321) projects, we will have brain transcription data of three major populations in the world.
Our specific aims include: 1) to relate SNPs to gene expression (the S-E portion of the S-E-D networks), we will
develop and compare eQTL and coexpression networks of postmortem brains from three populations, EA, AFR and
EU; 2) to connect SNP-expression to SCZ GWAS signals (the S-E-D aspect), we will use brain eQTL data to
explain SCZ GWAS of EA, EU and AFR populations and to identify SCZ risk loci that also serve as regulators of
brain gene expression; 3) to develop a novel cross-population predixcan algorithm that can infer genetically
regulated gene expression, and identify those differentially expressed in patients. The algorithm will be used
to re-analyze existing PGC SCZ data, and use Vanderbilt University data to replicate the findings. This study will
improve the understanding of the genetic contribution of population diversity to SCZ risk. It is critical for developing
more precise diagnoses and treatments for the benefit of diverse populations, for addressing health disparity.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Project Summary: Most genetic variants associated with disease in genome-wide association studies (GWAS)
lie in non-coding gene regulatory elements (GRE; e.g., promoters and enhancers). GREs are tissue- and cell
type-specific and are identified through their epigenomic signatures, including low DNA methylation (DNAm),
DNA accessibility and certain histone modifications. The PsychENCODE Consortium has characterized brain
GREs across brain regions and developmental time points, as well as in the brains of psychiatric patients using
mostly DNA accessibility and histone modification marks. These marks, however, identify large regions of
enrichment (~300-2,000bp), providing only low resolution coverage of the important regulatory nucleotides, e.g.,
transcription factor binding sites. DNAm (especially cell type-specific DNAm) has received less attention,
although it has been linked to psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia (SZ) and bipolar disorder (BD).
 In the adult human brain, ~80% of CG and 1.5% of non-CG (CH) sites are methylated, and can be converted
to hydroxymethylcytosine (hmC) and further demethylated. In postmitotic neuronal genomes, mCH and hmC
accumulate to a significantly higher level than in other tissues--a distinct feature of the brain's epigenome.
Bisulfite sequencing (BS)-based approaches that are used to measure (h)mC can pinpoint GREs with single
base resolution, presenting a unique opportunity to refine the gene regulatory landscape of the brain cell types.
 Here we aim to create reference DNAm maps [mC and hmC, using BS and oxidative (ox)BS sequencing]
and transcriptional profiles (using RNA-seq) in two major subtypes of neurons in the human dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), namely excitatory glutamatergic (Glu) and inhibitory GABA-ergic neurons. The
proposed work is based on fluorescence-activated nuclear sorting (FANS) methods that we recently developed
to separate nuclei of different cell types from autopsied human brain, and on our recent findings that showed
unexpected relationships between DNA(h)m, GREs, and gene expression in the DLPFC Glu and GABA neurons.
 We will perform these studies at key time points of postnatal brain development and adulthood to map
DNA(h)m within active neuron subtype-specific GREs that may be vulnerable to disruption during childhood and
adolescence periods that coincide with the critical processes of brain maturation and circuit refinement (Aim 1).
This work will be complemented with single nucleus mC profiling, which will allow us to define the developmental
trajectories of mC in discrete subpopulations of Glu and GABA neurons (Aim2).
 Finally, we will profile Glu and GABA neurons in 150 autopsied DLPFC samples obtained from controls and
cases of SZ and BD, and will then map neuron subtype-specific gene expression and (hydroxy)methylation
quantitative trait loci (eQTL, mQTLS, hmQTLs) (Aim3). We will integrate QTL, transcriptome, and DNA(h)m data
with the results of SZ and BP GWAS to reveal DNA(h)m and gene expression-mediated causal risk variants and
genes, and to distinguish specific neuronal subtype(s) that are critical in the etiology of these disorders.

Eukaryotic RNA polymerase I (Pol I) transcribes ribosomal RNA, a key component of ribosomes. Pol I transcription
accounts for the majority of the total RNA in cells, and its upregulation in human cells is a hallmark of cancer while
its downregulation is a hallmark of several developmental disorders. Pol I transcription is understudied compared
to transcription by Pol II and even Pol III. Our preliminary work suggests fundamental differences between Pol I
and Pols II and III that are the basis for this proposal. Our broad long-term objectives are to determine the molecular
mechanism of Pol I transcription and how its dysregulation leads to cancer and developmental disorders. There
are major gaps in our understanding of (1) the structural organization and architecture of Pol I transcription
complexes; (2) the mechanism for how Pol I initiation factors interact with rDNA, which encodes ribosomal RNA;
and (3) the molecular function of several key Pol I transcription factors in the activation process. The first rationale
for this work is that determining the mechanism and regulation of Pol I transcription will form the molecular basis
for understanding how Pol I defects lead to human disease. Our central hypothesis is that Pol I factors use a
unique mechanism to carry out transcription and their structure and function is different from the mechanisms
governing Pol II and III transcription. The second rationale is that understanding the Pol I transcription mechanism
at the most basic and fundamental levels will translate to a better understanding of the connection between Pol I
and cancer, leading to new cancer therapeutic strategies. Our proposed research will use a conceptually and
technically innovative cross-organismal and interdisciplinary approach that employs a combination of bioinformatic,
computational, molecular, biochemical, genetic, genomic, proteomic, and structural methods in the yeast and
human cells. Guided by strong preliminary studies, we will test two specific aims: (1) Determine the unique
“coactivator” role of TATA-binding protein (TBP) in Pol I transcription, and (2) Determine the mechanism of Pol I
transcription activation. To accomplish these aims, we will use well-established and complementary approaches
to identify and map novel Pol I interactions in their native context. We will complement these studies with structural
modeling in combination with molecular, genetic, and biochemical functional assays to identify Pol I factor functions
conserved from yeast to humans. The proposed research is significant because it will lead to a detailed description
of the Pol I transcription mechanism and will provide a conceptual framework for understanding the link between
Pol I and human disease. Ultimately, this work will illuminate new avenues for diagnosis, potential interventions,
and the development of therapies targeting these novel protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
Although secreted molecular chaperone heat shock protein 90 (eHSP90) has been implicated in tumor cell
invasion through binding and stabilizing extracellular matrix protease client MMP2, our limited understanding of
the regulatory mechanisms that control the eHSP90 chaperone system is a major drawback for designing
successful HSP90-targeted therapies. Our long-term goal is to develop therapeutic strategies that prevent
tumor cell invasion by targeting the extracellular HSP90 chaperone machinery. Our overall objective is to
elucidate how eHSP90 and its regulators are mechanistically modulated, individually and collectively, and in
the presence of their extracellular inhibitors. Our central hypothesis is that extracellular ATP, and tyrosine
phosphorylation of eHSP90 co-chaperone TIMP2, modulate the chaperoning of client MMP2, and affect
HSP90 binding to extracellular inhibitors. This hypothesis is based on our recent published work and
preliminary studies showing that eHSP90 binds and hydrolyzes ATP, and that co-chaperone TIMP2 enhances
HSP90 binding to ATP and its pharmacologic inhibitors. Our rationale is that by elucidating mechanisms of
eHSP90 chaperone regulation, we will design better therapies for diseases that implicate the eHSP90
machinery. We plan to test our central hypothesis by pursuing the following three specific aims: 1) Investigate
the role of ATPase activity in the regulation of extracellular HSP90 (eHSP90); 2) Determine the impact of
tyrosine phosphorylation of TIMP2 on its co-chaperone function; and 3) Elucidate the role of TIMP2 in
enhancing eHSP90 binding to extracellular inhibitors. Under the first aim, approaches to be used are already
established in PI's laboratory and include purification of intracellular and extracellular HSP90 from human cell
cultures, isothermal calorimetry to determine affinity towards an ATP analog, ATPase assays to measure
ATPase activity, enzyme kinetics to determine proteolytic activity, and in vitro and in vivo protein-protein
interactions in the presence and following depletion of extracellular ATP in genetic knock out cell cultures.
Under the second aim, phosphomimetic or non-phosphorylatable TIMP2 mutants designed in the PI's
laboratory will be used, CRISPR knock out cell lines for c-Src kinase, TIMP2 and MMP2 will be employed for
protein-protein interactions and to determine impact on MMP2 activity. Under the third aim, the role of TIMP2,
non-phosphorylatable and phophomimetic mutants in enhanced binding of eHSP90 to its extracellular
inhibitors will be evaluated in drug binding assays performed in vitro and extracellularly in vivo, using human
cell lines and siRNA technology. The impact of TIMP2, and eHSP90 inhibitors on MMP2 mediated proteolysis
will be evaluated in matrix degradation studies. The research approach is innovative, in the PI's opinion,
because it represents a new and substantive departure from the status quo by shifting focus towards targeting
chaperone-regulated extracellular pathways. The proposed research is significant because, it is expected to
provide insight on the basic extracellular regulatory elements that support mechanisms of tumor cell invasion.

 Rod-mediated vision transitions seamlessly to cone-mediated vision as light levels rise through the
mesopic visual range. Despite the fact that mesopic vision is the major mode of vision for people who spend
most of their time indoors under artificial lighting, there is a glaring lack of knowledge of how rod and cone
photoresponses shape the temporal, spatial, and spectral sensitivities of mesopic vision. For decades it has
been accepted that rods subserve vision in dim scenes, detecting only slow variations in light levels (contrast),
and cones subserve vision in bright scenes when contrast changes rapidly. Our recently published results show
that at indoor (mesopic) light levels, rods drive the visual responses to fast — not slow — temporal variations.
Our findings reveal, for the first time, that adaptation of both rod and cone-driven visual responses underlie the
seamless transition between scotopic and photopic vision over the mesopic range, but we do not understand
how this happens. Therefore, there is a critical need to understand the physiology and functional significance of
rod responses at mesopic, indoor light levels. In this application our objectives are: (i) to determine the adaptation
mechanisms that control the responses of rods to slow and fast light variations in mesopic lights, and (ii) to
determine the behavioral significance of rod-driven visual responses to fast changing scenes in mesopic lights.
Our model is that a hierarchical system of adaptation mechanisms is in place to differentially regulate rod
sensitivity as lights rise through the mesopic range. To test this model we propose two related but independent
aims that investigate the underlying cellular and perceptual mechanisms. These aims are to determine 1) how
rods respond to slow and fast variations in mesopic lights, and 2) the behavioral significance of inner segment
conductances to the adaptation of rod visual responses in mesopic lights. For the first aim we will combine the
power of mouse genetics, electrophysiological recordings, quantitative modeling, and operant behavioral assays
to determine how different phototransduction adaptation mechanisms, including background and bleaching
adaptation, work together to differentially regulate the responses to slow and fast light variations and to overcome
the crippling effects of response compression in mesopic illumination. For the second aim, we will use mice with
rod-specific knockout of voltage-gated conductances that are typically activated at mesopic lights to probe the
functional significance of inner segment conductances to rod-driven responses in mesopic lights. Our expected
outcome is to provide evidence for mechanisms that the visual system uses to encode signal variations in
mesopic lights (Advancement of Basic Knowledge). Knowledge of this mechanisms will open new strategies for
understanding and treating retinal pathological conditions, with implications beyond this particular application
(Innovation for Emerging Therapy).

The objectives of this proposal are to determine the mechanisms of photoreceptor protein
compartmentalization. Retinal photoreceptors are polarized neurons whose major functions,
include receiving and transmitting signals, are compartmentalized into discrete subcellular
domains. Compartmentalization is critical for normal photoreceptor activity and reduced vision or
blindness result from improper segregation of proteins. Despite their importance, the mechanisms
underlying protein compartmentalization in photoreceptors, or any other neuron, remain poorly
understood. Essential for understanding compartmentalization are the biophysical properties of
the photoreceptor cytoplasm, the biophysical properties of the proteins that are destined to be
compartmentalized and the forces that drive accumulation of proteins, against significant
concentration gradients, into the specific compartments. We have uncovered a fundamental
biophysical mechanism that may be central to protein transport and segregation in all electrically
active cells: transport of charged proteins within the electrical field generated by the photoreceptor
neuronal activity. We call this novel mechanism axial dynamic electrophoretic protein
transport (ADEPT). We will use state of the art live cell fluorescence imaging tools developed in
our lab, powerful transgenic and gene editing techniques in Xenopus, and sophisticated
biochemical and cell biological approaches to address the following aims:
Aim 1: Map the axial cytoplasmic electric field, Eax, in rod photoreceptors.
Aim 2: Determine the impact of ADEPT on photoreceptor protein transport and
compartmentalization in living photoreceptors.
Aim 3: Determine the locations and influence of Arrestin interactions on their distributions
and dynamics in living rods and cones.

Disruption of normal glomerular filtration is one of the key causes of end-stage renal disease, leading to the need for renal replacement therapy. Myosin 1e (Myo1e) is a cytoskeletal protein that is highly expressed in the glomerular epithelial cells (podocytes) and is involved in many processes important for podocyte function, such as actin assembly regulation, endocytosis, and regulation of cell adhesion. Mutations in MYO1E are found in patients with chronic kidney disease, highlighting its role in maintaining glomerular filtration barrier. In this project we will examine the role of Myo1e activity in supporting podocyte cytoskeletal organization and normal kidney function and test the hypothesis that activation of Myo1e can help protect podocytes from injury and preserve normal glomerular filtration. In Aim 1 we will analyze how disease-associated mutations affect Myo1e functions and activity using a combination of cell-based and in vitro (biochemical) methods. In Aim 2 we will determine the mechanism of autoinhibition of Myo1e activity. In Aim 3 we will test how Myo1e activity helps maintain podocyte integrity and whether activation of Myo1e will have a protective effect on kidney function.

Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infects the majority of people in the world and can cause serious disease in
immunocompromised patients and neonates. The virus establishes life-long latency in bone marrow cells and
disseminates to peripheral organs in quiescently infected monocytes. Antiviral therapy delays virus replication,
but does not eliminate infected cells. Virus rebound, resistance, and drug toxicity complicate treatment and
create a strong demand for improved therapeutics. We advocate that the suppression of HCMV replication must
be in combination with the killing of infected monocytes. We found that HCMV infection of fibroblasts and
monocytes rapidly stimulated the activity of heat shock factor (HSF) 1, a stress-responsive transcription factor,
in a distinct fashion from canonical activation induced by heat shock (HS). Using a novel tool compound called
DTHIB, which has been validated to selectively inhibit HSF1 activity, we found inhibition of HSF1 with DTHIB
attenuated HCMV lytic replication and stimulated death of latently infected monocytes. These studies provide
the beginnings of a proof-of-concept study that HSF1 antagonists may have the capacity to provide the double
“hit” necessary to suppress HCMV replication and eliminate latently infected myeloid cells in a single drug. Thus,
our central hypothesis is that inhibition of HSF1 with the tool compound DTHIB will limit both infection
and spread within an infected host by concomitantly attenuating HCMV lytic replication in permissive
cell types and eliminating latently infected monocytes. The first aim will continue to evaluate the antiviral
potential of DTHIB as an inhibitor of HCMV lytic replication by examining the drug efficacy on different HCMV
permissive cell types, viral strains, and multiplicities of infection (MOIs). We will also conduct transcriptome (RNA
sequencing) analyses and functional studies using DTHIB to identify genes dependent on HCMV-induced HSF1
activity responsible for promoting lytic replication and the impact of DTHIB on the expression of this HCMV-
induced, HSF1-dependent gene profile. The second aim will continue to assess the ability of DTHIB to stimulate
the death of latently infected monocytes by testing the selective drug toxicity on monocytes infected with different
viral strains and at different MOIs. In conjunction, we will perform translatome (polysomal profiling) analyses and
functional studies using DTHIB to identify HSF1-dependent genes responsible for promoting the survival of
latently infected monocytes. The third aim will assess the in vivo antiviral activity of DTHIB on lytic replication,
viral spread, and pathogenesis using a novel murine transplant model with human skin organ, which can
simultaneously monitor HCMV replication in human tissue as well as monitor monocyte-mediated HCMV spread
to distal sites.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a common pathogen that has infected a majority of the human population. While symptoms of HCMV are generally resolved in immunocompetent individuals, the virus remains for the lifetime within the host as a latent infection is established in the hematopoietic stem cells. HCMV has co- evolved with humans and as such, the virus as adapted to undermine host cell antiviral responses. How HCMV undermines these responses is not fully known. Our research has found that an understudied protein modification, S-nitrosylation, plays a role in how HCMV interacts with the antiviral response. We found that viral proteins critical for efficient lytic replication are post translationally modified with nitric oxide groups and that the resulting modifications alter the viral proteins ability to limit antiviral responses. We propose to mechanistically investigate how these modifications impact HCMV protein functions and to identify the impact of S-nitrosylation on HCMV replication. Completion of the aims above will contribute significantly to our knowledge the regulation of biological functions of critical viral factors as well as identify the mechanism by which viruses weaken host defenses against infection. This work will lay the foundation in identifying novel therapeutic targets for a pathogen that lacks a vaccine or a cure.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease of unknown etiology. The pathogenesis is
partly attributed to compartmentalized oxidative stress inside and outside the immune system. The proposed
studies will focus on a critical gap in knowledge - how metabolic pathways that neutralize oxidative stress control
autoimmunity in SLE. The central hypothesis for this project is based on comprehensive metabolome studies
that have showed a dominant impact of SLE on the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) in lymphocytes of
patients and T cells of lupus-prone mice undergoing lineage polarization; the results of which mimic the
deficiency of transaldolase (TAL), a rate-limiting enzyme of the PPP. Lupus-prone mice exhibit activation of the
mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and mitochondrial oxidative stress in the liver and antiphospholipid
antibody (aPL) production prior to the onset of nephritis. Similar to lupus-prone strains, mice lacking TAL exhibit
mTOR activation and overexpression of NDUFS3, a subunit of complex I in the mitochondrial electron transport
chain (ETC) that triggers the production of reactive oxygen intermediates (ROI) and aPL, both of which respond
to rapamycin treatment. TAL deficiency blocks the glycosylation and secretion of PON1 by the liver. This is
attributed to carbon trapping in the PPP and depletion of UDP-GlcNAc which are also detectable in SLE patients
and mice. Although PON1 loss in the plasma has been connected to aPL production and demonstrated in SLE,
antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), and liver diseases, the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Therefore,
the Specific Aims will test our working hypothesis that TAL inactivation i) elicits cell type-specific carbon
sequestration in the PPP and limits substrates for NADPH and GSH production and metabolism through the
ETC and thus triggers a compensatory accumulation of oxidative stress-generating mitochondria, mTOR
pathway activation and pro-inflammatory lineage skewing in the immune system; and ii) limits the availability of
UDP-GlcNAc for glycosylation and secretion of PON1 by the liver, which in turn trigger aPL production in SLE
and TAL deficiency. Under Aim 1, we will test the hypothesis that TAL-regulated carbon flux through the PPP
causes cell-type specific accumulation of sedoheptulose 7-phosphate, depletion of NADPH and GSH, and
redox-mediated mTOR activation to promote the expansion Th17, Tfh, and DN T cells and constriction of CD8
EMT cells and Tregs in SLE patients. Under Aim 2, we will delineate T-cell intrinsic metabolic checkpoints that
control systemic autoimmunity in lupus-prone mice. Under Aim 3, we will determine the role of hepatocyte-
derived oxidative stress in aPL production, pro-inflammatory lineage skewing in the immune system and lupus
pathogenesis. The proposed research is significant because it will establish new, compartmentally defined
metabolic checkpoints of autoimmunity with broad translational relevance for the pathogenesis and treatment
of SLE. The approach is innovative as it will employ genetic checkpoints of oxidative stress and high-resolution
stable isotope tracing of metabolic pathways to delineate lupus pathogenesis.

Loss of vision has a devastating impact on an individual's quality of life. Most blinding diseases result from loss
of neurons in the retina. A promising strategy to treat sight-threatening diseases, is to harness the regenerative
potential of cells within the retina. Müller glia (MG), possess an extraordinary capacity in lower vertebrates to
regenerate retinal neurons. However, in mammalian retinas, including humans, MG are unable to replace
neurons lost to injury or disease. Recently, we have developed strategies to neurogenically reprogram MG in
adult mice by overexpressing the transcription factor Ascl1 in MG. Remarkably, the treatment of Ascl1
overexpression, combined with NMDA-induced retinal damage and histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibition,
causes MG to regenerate functional neurons in the adult mammalian retina. While this is significant progress
towards realizing the therapeutic potential of MG, only a subset of MG successfully reprogram into neurogenic
progenitors while another subset of MG express genes associated with inflammatory processes. We
hypothesized that the inflammation that accompanies neuronal cell loss restricts the regenerative potential of
MG. Indeed, we recently found that ablation of microglia, the endogenous immune cell of the retina,
dramatically improved MG-mediated retinal regeneration. This finding implicates the neuroimmune system as a
key component of the regenerative response of the mammalian retina. However, little is known about the
neuroimmune interface in retinal repair strategies such as endogenous regeneration. This proposal outlines
studies to better understand the neuroimmune axis during MG-mediated retinal regeneration and to develop
immunomodulation strategies to improve the regenerative capacity of the mammalian retina. The data
generated in this proposal will be foundational to Dr. Todd's ultimate goal of becoming an independent
investigator. During the K99 portion, Dr. Todd will expand his technical and theoretical expertise in
neuroimmunology to accomplish his aims studying immune-glial interactions during retinal regeneration. New
collaborations will be established with investigators in neuroimmunology and further training activities will
prepare Dr. Todd to become a successful investigator in the field. The training portion of this proposal will take
place at the University of Washington, which offers exceptional access to both research equipment and faculty
expertise to assist in the accomplishment of the applicant's goals.

 Mutations in USH2A (usherin) are common causes of autosomal recessive blinding diseases in
non-syndromic retinitis pigmentosa as well as syndromic Usher syndrome type II that manifests
congenital hearing loss as well. There is no effective therapy for these diseases. How usherin
contributes to photoreceptor health is poorly understood. An usherin-deficient animal model that
exhibits severe retinal degeneration as in human patients is essential for understanding the
pathological mechanisms and for development of effective therapies to preserve or restore vision.
This project is aimed at generating an usherin-deficient model that recapitulates the phenotypes found
in human patients.

In this proposal we will address one of the major unanswered questions in vision: the mechanism
of rhodopsin delivery and loading into new photoreceptor discs. This perpetual process is
particularly robust in rods where, for mammals, the daily delivery of 30 million rhodopsins supports
the formation of 80 new discs in each rod. While rhodopsin synthesis and delivery to the rod apical
region has been intensively studied, almost nothing is known about what happens afterward, thus
representing a critical knowledge gap. Roadblocks to under-standing this process include the
complexity of the inner segment-outer segment interface that is below the resolution limit of
fluorescence microscopy and the limitations of prior approaches that relied almost exclusively on
static analyses in fixed tissues. To overcome these roadblocks, we have implemented live-cell 3D
super resolution single particle tracking microscopy (3D-sptPALM) to directly examine the
dynamics of individual rhodopsins within discrete photoreceptor compartments in real time. We
will exploit a key mouse model, the retinal degeneration slow (rds) mouse, which allows us to
intentionally vary the level of outer segment membrane complexity while retaining the
photoreceptor cilium. Our preliminary results show the entry of individual rhodopsins into
photoreceptor cilia, their transport along the cilium and, remarkably, their exit back into the inner
segment, for the very first time.
We will address the following fundamental questions:
Aim 1: How does rhodopsin enter (and exit) the photoreceptor cilium?
Aim 2: How is rhodopsin transported within photoreceptor cilia?
Aim 3: How are rhodopsins loaded into new discs?

I am an academic clinician scientist with a focus on the genetics of respiratory diseases. My overarching career
goal is to make an important contribution to the public health burden of chronic respiratory diseases. I aim to
become an independent investigator with the skill set to utilize integrative ‘omic techniques for the improved
biological understanding and clinical management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The
proposed research combines my prior experience in genetics and transcriptomics with training in genetic
association, transcriptomic analyses, and machine learning, in order to better understand the variability in
COPD genetic risk. The hypothesis of this proposal is that there are genetic variants and transcriptomic
factors that are associated with resilience to COPD. This will be tested by leveraging existing data from
multiple well-phenotyped studies from the NHLBI TransOmics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) program.
Specific Aims: (1) Identify genetic variation associated with resilience to COPD against a background of
elevated genetic risk; (2) Define clinical, imaging, and blood gene-expression features of COPD
resilience; and (3) Predict lung-tissue gene-expression profiles of COPD risk and resilience from blood
gene-expression data. The cutting-edge research plan utilizes innovative methodologies to characterize
genetic and transcriptomic resilience to COPD. It is accompanied by a training plan that will provide me with
the skills to complete the research aims and the experience to transition to an independent research career. I
plan to submit an R01 expanding upon the characterization of genetic and transcriptomic resilience in COPD
by combining multi-omic risk- and resilience-scoring and lung-tissue gene-expression imputation to improve
understanding of the biological mechanisms that contribute to observed clinical heterogeneity in COPD. In
particular, I have four training goals that build upon my existing background in respiratory genetics. (1)
Strengthen my knowledge of biostatistics, statistical genomics, and bioinformatic methods; (2) Expand
my skills in transcriptomic methodologies; (3) Gain experience and expertise in the development and
implementation of machine-learning algorithms; and (4) Further develop my mentoring skills and
understanding of study design. I am supported by a mentoring team with complementary skillsets and
successful mentoring careers, which, together with my experience, training, and substantial preliminary data,
will guarantee the success of this proposal. The findings may pave the way for the development of precision
risk-prediction approaches, while implementing a novel methodology to address one of the most important
challenges in the field today: identification of genetic and transcriptomic resilience to COPD.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Doxorubicin is routinely prescribed in treatment of various cancers because of its extremely high efficacy.
However, its use is severely limited because of its potential to cause irreversible cardiotoxicity. Since cessation
of therapy is not viable in cancer patients, there is a need to explore the molecular mechanisms underlying
cardiotoxicity to accurately identify risk factors as well as therapeutic targets for effective adjuncts. The primary
mechanism by which doxorubicin exerts its cardiotoxic effects is due to preferential accumulation of excess iron
in cardiac mitochondria, which generates cytotoxic free radicals, and disruption of cellular and subcellular iron
utilization. Thus, chelating excess mitochondrial iron can prevent doxorubicin-induced cardiac dysfunction.
Indeed, the only drug approved to treat doxorubicin cardiomyopathy, dexrazoxane, has demonstrated
mitochondrial chelation potential. However, dexrazoxane alters topoisomerases, the enzymes responsible for
DNA replication and doxorubicin’s pharmacological target, which thereby impairs doxorubicin’s anticancer
activity. In addition, dexrazoxane has potential to induce fatal myelosuppression and acute leukemias, which
consequently limit its clinical utility. Cancer survivors who subsequently develop cardiomyopathies have the
worst survivals among all cardiomyopathies, and timely intervention results in a superior clinical outcome in those
survivors treated with cardiotoxic chemotherapy. Thus, there is a major unmet need for mitochondria-specific
iron chelators that do not impede doxorubicin’s antitumor activity. Earlier we have demonstrated that hinokitiol,
a small molecule with high iron binding affinity and cell permeability, corrects abnormal iron buildup across the
membrane caused by genetic deficiency in mitochondrial iron transporters. These findings prompted us to
question if hinokitiol could rescue doxorubicin-induced mitochondrial accumulation of iron. Our pilot study has
indicated a feasibility that hinokitiol corrects mitochondrial iron overload and improves survival in cardiac cells
treated with doxorubicin with no influence on tumor-killing effect of doxorubicin. Thus, we hypothesize that
hinokitiol mobilizes excess iron from the cardiac mitochondria and prevents oxidative damage, thereby reversing
doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy, while preserving doxorubicin’s anticancer activity. The specific aims are
to determine: i) mitochondrial iron export after hinokitiol administration, ii) the cardioprotective effect of hinokitiol
on doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity, and iii) the effect of hinokitiol on the antineoplastic efficacy of doxorubicin
using tumor-bearing mice. Our studies will provide a new therapeutic strategy to reverse abnormal accumulation
of mitochondrial iron and correct doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity without compromising its antineoplastic
effects. If successful, this drug can be safely co-administered with doxorubicin as a rescue factor to improve the
therapeutic index of doxorubicin along with better clinical outcome.

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality, with 19 million deaths globally
in 2020 alone. Central to management of CVDs is deepening our knowledge of physiology and pathology of the
heart. Major barriers to our greater understanding of the heart include its deep location and fast dynamics.
Evidence from invasive coronary angiography indicates that the maximum velocity of cardiac structures is 52.5
mm/s, requiring a scan time of 19.1ms to eliminate motion artifacts. To achieve this temporal resolution with
CT is extremely challenging. There have been substantial gains in CT hardware and software over the last
decades (whole heart, dual-source, dedicated cardiac CT, and various approaches to cardiac motion
compensation with ECG-gating) that have transformed coronary CT angiography into a robust and viable clinical
tool. However, owing to the 140ms temporal resolution of current whole heart CT scanners, diagnosis is still
challenging in patients who have irregular and/or fast heart rates especially in cases of arrhythmias and
tachycardia, which commonly occur in older adults, many of whom exhibit atrial fibrillation.
Here we will apply deep learning to radically improve cardiac CT reconstruction by attaining significantly higher
spatial resolution, lower radiation exposure, and better image quality on both modern and legacy CT hardware.
To improve wide-area-detector cardiac CT performance, we will develop a limited-angle reconstruction algorithm
in the Analytic, Compressive, Iterative, and Deep (ACID) reconstruction framework that integrates a deep
network trained on large data, sparsity-promotion, analytic modeling, and iterative refinement. For the first time,
two of the preeminent advances in signal processing, compressive sensing and deep learning, will be combined
to extract full information from scan data and image priors to freeze the beating heart.
The specific aims H3 are: (1) Hyper Dataset: Projection datasets in the Radon space and the corresponding
ground-truth images without motion artifacts in the image space will be generated in simulation, experiments,
and clinical studies; (2) Hybrid Algorithm: A deep learning network and CS-module will be developed, integrated,
and accelerated within the ACID framework for limited-angle free-breathing cardiac CT reconstruction, which will
be shared on an open-source platform; and (3) Holistic Evaluation: The performance of our reconstruction
software will be characterized, the stability and generalizability will be investigated, and task-based clinical
applications will be demonstrated, including quantification of stenosis severity, aorta dimensions, and motion
artifacts within the clinical setting of individuals with atrial fibrillation, tachycardia, and irregular heart rates.
Completion of this project will yield a free-breathing cardiac CT algorithm with the unprecedented temporal
resolution of 60ms, a 230% improvement over the state-of-the-art, allowing cardiac CT without clinically-relevant
motion artifacts. This represents a major step towards the integration of model-driven and data-driven methods
for CT image reconstruction, with a lasting impact on not only CT but also other tomographic modalities.

Although actin is highly conserved throughout eukarya, the mechanisms used to regulate its assembly and
disassembly vary across phyla. Precisely timed and placed actin assembly orchestrates nearly every cellular
process, including cell migration. While actin-driven cell migration has been defined in some detail in animal
cells, it is unknown if diverse eukaryotic pathogens operate using the same set of rules. This proposal will
address the hypothesis that there are conserved principles of cell migration by investigating Naegleria, which
diverged from the “yeast-to-human” lineage over a billion years ago. Specifically, this work will define the
contributions of the cytoskeleton to cell crawling in the “brain-eating amoeba” Naegleria fowleri: a pathogen
that crawls into and within the brain, causing a deadly form of meningitis for which there are no reliable
treatments. Dr. Velle’s initial postdoctoral research using the commonly-used, non-pathogenic model system
Naegleria gruberi highlights the potential for universal rules of motility; N. gruberi crawls on flat surfaces using
thin, actin- based protrusions assembled by proteins called the Arp2/3 complex. This actin and Arp2/3 based
mechanism is also how animal cells crawl on flat surfaces. However, outside of laboratory conditions, cells
rarely—if ever—crawl on flat, uniform surfaces. Animal cells are well-known to switch to a different mode of
motility when crawling through complex, restrictive environments, but this has not been tested in Naegleria.
Because N. fowleri crawl through narrow channels in the skull and into the brain, despite no known
chemotactic signals, dissecting cell migration in restrictive environments is essential for understanding disease.
Therefore, Aim 1 will determine mechanisms of cell crawling under confinement at the level of cell behavior.
Aim 2 will focus on the actin networks in cells; while the protrusions driving N. gruberi migration on flat surfaces
look similar to those of animal cells, defining the actin architecture using Platinum Replica Electron Microscopy
(PREM) will reveal if the ultrastructure is conserved. This aim will also provide critical training to complement
Dr. Velle’s background in light microscopy. The world expert in PREM, Dr. Svitkina, will provide this training as
a member of the scientific advisory committee. Aim 3 will use biochemistry—a technique the applicant has no
prior training in—to examine the upstream mechanisms of Arp2/3 complex activation. Dr. Velle has recruited
Dr. Bruce Goode, an expert actin biochemist, for this training. Because the leading labs in the field of cell
migration frequently employ both microscopy and in vitro actin biochemistry, the proposed training in PREM
and biochemistry will ensure the applicant is skilled in the techniques required for success. Dr. Velle has also
recruited Dr. Matt Welch, an actin expert, Dr. Meg Titus, who has expertise in actin and amoebae, and Dr. Jim
Morris, an expert in N. fowleri, to her scientific advisory committee to provide scientific and career mentoring.
Collectively, the proposed work will provide the technical training, and career mentorship required to launch Dr.
Velle’s career as an independent investigator with a research program focused on Naegleria’s migration.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
 Wnt signaling is an evolutionarily conserved pathway that regulates several cellular behaviors such as
cell proliferation, survival, differentiation, and migration to promote tissue homeostasis. Of note, the Wg/Wnt
signaling pathway is important for tissue patterning and is often deregulated in epithelial cancers. Secreted Wnt
ligands are distributed in the extracellular space to promote paracrine and long-range signaling in target cells.
These paracrine and long-range functions of Wnts are dependent on extracellular Wnt availability, which in part
is dictated by cell-surface glypican, Dally-like protein (Dlp). In this proposal, I will focus on molecular mechanisms
that dictate Dlp-mediated regulation of Wnt availability and signaling.
 Dlp’s role in regulating Wnt signaling has been described as ‘biphasic’: By continual binding and release,
Dlp simultaneously promotes long-range signaling and restricts paracrine signaling, ensuring proper ligand
availability at both ranges. The Page-McCaw lab established Drosophila germarium, a tissue where oogenesis
occurs, as a model to study mechanisms that define Wnt signaling ranges, and identified a novel Dlp/Mmp2
(Matrix Metalloprotease 2) module that modulates paracrine and long-range Wnt signaling in the germarium.
Specifically, I found that proteolytic cleavage of Dlp by Mmp2 alters its subcellular localization and function to
modulate Wnt availability. Additionally, my preliminary data suggest that Dlp/Mmp2 may regulate Wnt signaling
in epithelial tumors to promote tumor growth. In Aim 1, I will investigate the molecular events that occur
downstream of proteolytic cleavage of Dlp to modulate Wg/Wnt availability and signaling in the germarium and
tumors.
 The extracellular Wnt distribution is tightly linked with its production and secretion. I found that Dlp can
modulate Wg (Wnt-1) production in source cells in the germarium. Wg production in source cells in germaria is
tightly regulated and this regulation is crucial for proper oogenesis. Additionally, I found that Dlp interacts with
non-ligand proteins (a finding that has not been previously reported) that communicate with intracellular
cytoskeletal machinery, potentially to modulate cell adhesion and/or shape. In Aim 2, I will investigate novel
mechanisms of how Dlp regulates Wnt ligand production and long-range Wg distribution to facilitate long-range
Wg signaling. These investigations will uncover previously unappreciated roles of cell-surface glypicans in
regulating Wnt signaling and elucidate novel paradigms of developmental strategies employed in multicellular
organisms to maintain tissue homeostasis.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common sexually transmitted virus in the United States (U.S.). HPV infection is
linked to cancers of the cervix, vulva, vagina, penis, anus, and oropharynx, thus representing a significant public health
concern. The HPV vaccine is the most efficient and cost-effective mechanism for combating HPV infection and its cancer-
related consequences. Nonetheless, HPV vaccination rates for age-eligible adolescents remain suboptimal in the U.S.
Scientific evidence underscores the critical influence of sociocultural and contextual factors on parents’ acceptability and
uptake of the HPV vaccination. Sociocultural values, family expectations, health literacy, beliefs, attitudes, and knowledge
influence parents’ behaviors and decisions, healthcare-seeking and utilization, and health outcomes. Black women are
disproportionally affected by HPV-associated morbidity and mortality, with the second-highest cervical cancer incidence
rate, the second highest after non-Hispanic Whites and the highest cancer mortality rate. However, there is a lack of data
for African ethnic minority subgroups such as Cape Verdeans (CV) in the U.S, an ethnic minority group of mixed West
African and Portuguese roots. The U.S. is home to the largest CV population outside the country of Cape Verde, with an
estimated 265,000 CV immigrants and their descendants living in the U.S. CVs primarily reside (~90%) in Massachusetts
and Rhode Island. Understanding HPV and HPV vaccination knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors (KAB) of specific ethnic
minoritized and immigrant subgroups, such as CV, will make it possible to meet particular subgroup needs and improve
knowledge and practices, thereby improving health status and outcomes by decreasing cancer risk. Though recent research
has shown an increase in HPV uptake, but not necessarily HPV vaccine completion, among minority populations including
African Americans and Blacks, no data exist to show that this is the case for CV adolescents living in the U.S. Also, there
remains a paucity of data regarding HPV knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors of CV parents living in the U.S. Therefore,
the proposed study will focus on Cape Verdeans, a population group currently underrepresented in cancer health disparity
research, and seeks to: 1) explore the KAB regarding HPV and HPV vaccination (intention, hesitancy, barriers, initiation,
and completion) among CV mothers and fathers (Phase 1: Focus Groups); and 2) explore CV parents’ HPV KAB, health
communication, sociocultural factors, their intention to have their sons and daughters undergo HPV vaccination, HPV
vaccine hesitancy, barriers to HPV vaccination, and parent-reported receipt of HPV vaccine or refusal of the vaccine (Phase
2: Survey Administration). The proposed community-engaged research is innovative in that it will: 1) engage CVs, an
understudied ethnic minority and immigrant subpopulation currently underrepresented in HPV research, 2) include fathers
who are under-represented in HPV research, and 3) establish a partnership with Catholic and Protestant churches to further
assist with the important goal of addressing HPV vaccine myths and disseminating accurate HPV vaccine information to
CV communities. Moreover, it will provide a solid basis for the design of future linguistically and culturally tailored
education interventions to promote the HPV vaccine among CVs in the U.S. Moreover, this research will build further
research capacity to engage underserved, minority CV parents in future HPV and cancer prevention interventions.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
Lipomannan (LM) and lipoarabinomannan (LAM) are mycobacterial lipoglycans that are critical for Mycobacte-
rium tuberculosis to establish infection. These lipoglycans are synthesized in the plasma membrane and
trafficked to the cell surface. LM and LAM are widely conserved among mycobacteria, and therefore must also
play a fundamental role in the physiology of both pathogenic and nonpathogenic mycobacterial species. However,
it remains obscure how their biosynthesis is coordinated with other cell envelope biosyntheses and how they
contribute to the integrity of the cell envelope. The long-term goal is to determine the role of lipoglycans in my-
cobacterial physiology and identify vulnerabilities in the process of creating and maintaining the cell envelope
structure. As the next step, the objective of this proposal is to gain fundamental insights into the role of lipogly-
cans in cell envelope integrity in Mycobacterium smegmatis and M. tuberculosis. The central hypothesis is that
LM/LAM biosynthesis, in coordination with peptidoglycan and capsular a-glucan biosyntheses, positively con-
tributes to glycan homeostasis, ensuring the plasticity and integrity of cell surface structure during active growth.
The rationale is that finding vulnerabilities in the regulatory process that coordinates the glycan biosyntheses will
lay the foundation for cell envelope-targeting antimicrobial development. Guided by published and preliminary
data from the applicant’s laboratory, this hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two aims: 1) Identify the role of
LM/LAM biosynthesis in suppressing peptidoglycan degradation; and 2) Determine the role of the capsular layer
in maintaining cell envelope integrity. In the first aim, the hypothesis that the cell shape of a LAM-deficient mutant
deforms due to the weakened cell wall will be tested. The potential molecular mechanism of LAM suppressing
peptidoglycan hydrolases will be examined. In the second aim, the hypothesis that the morphological defect of
the LAM-deficient mutant can be overcome by activating the SenX3-RegX3 two-component system and increas-
ing the production of a-glucan will be examined. The proposed research is innovative because it reveals a new
role of mycobacterial lipoglycans in maintaining glycan homeostasis, and because it combines the synergistic
expertise of the applicant and his collaborators in forward genetics and bioorthogonal metabolic labeling of cell
wall biosynthesis, a substantive departure from the status quo in both concept and execution. The proposed
research is significant because the data obtained here will form the foundation for developing drugs that could
kill M. tuberculosis by targeting a regulatory mechanism of mycobacterial cell envelope homeostasis. Such a
drug may also make the cell envelope more permeable to other antimicrobials.

Breast cancer is a complex and heterogeneous disease where the roles of many prognostic factors, including
androgen receptor (AR) which is an emerging potential prognostic biomarker, remain unclear in its clinical pro-
gression. The Nurses' Health Studies (NHS), which motivated this application, are large prospective cohort
studies conducted to investigate the risk factors for major chronic diseases in women including breast cancer.
The data from the NHS contain invaluable information for breast cancer research such as lifestyle, hormonal,
and genetic risk factors, as well as clinical outcomes such as breast cancer diagnosis, recurrence, and death. In
many epidemiologic studies on breast cancer survival, including the NHS, the hazard ratio (HR), which is esti-
mated based on the proportional hazards (PH) model, has been the most routinely used effect measure despite
its limitations. In the NHS data, the PH assumption in the association between AR expression and breast cancer
survival was found to be violated. The interpretation of HR is challenging and the result is often misleading if the
PH assumption is violated, which makes it difﬁcult to assess AR's prognostic values. Recently, summary metrics
based on the restricted mean survival time (RMST), which is deﬁned as the life expectancy up to a speciﬁc time
point, have attracted substantial attention as useful alternatives to the HR. The RMST has many advantageous
features such as its straightforward interpretation and robustness. Speciﬁcally, we can assess the prognostic
factor's effects in terms of absolute effect, which is clinically more interpretable than the HR, without assuming
PH using the RMST-based regression model. In this project, we propose to develop novel statistical methods
based on RMST to fully utilize the rich data from the NHS and to gain a better understanding of the complex
effect of AR on breast cancer progression and survival. Under Aim 1, we will develop a ﬂexible regression
method based on RMST that estimates the varying covariate effects across a range of time. The proposed
regression method will be used to elucidate the clinical signiﬁcance of AR in survival by different subtypes of
breast cancers. Under Aim 2, we will develop a model-free approach to summarize the bivariate survival
data (i.e., time from an initial event to an intermediate event and from the intermediate event to a failure
event). The metrics developed under Aim 2 will be used to study residual survival after breast cancer recurrence
and facilitate comparisons between groups by AR status for different breast cancer subtypes. These novel sta-
tistical approaches will be applied to data from the NHS to obtain new knowledge about the prognostic values of
AR and potentially lead to better targeted therapies.

Therapy resistance is a major barrier to long term remission in pediatric T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-
ALL). The prognosis for children with relapsed or refractory disease is dismal. Leukemia-initiating cells (L-ICs)
regenerate disease upon transplantation into mice. They also recapitulate the immunophenotypic complexity of
the parent leukemia supporting that, as in normal hematopoiesis, there is a cellular hierarchy among leukemic
cells. Our laboratory has previously demonstrated that the L-IC is a committed thymocyte progenitor and resides
in the leukemic DN3 population, however, only a fraction of DN3 cells can give rise to disease. L-ICs rely on
NOTCH1-induced MYC signaling for survival. Recent studies identified dormant, therapy resistant L-ICs in both
murine models and T-ALL patient samples. The role of cell cycle restriction in L-IC latency is incompletely
understood. In an effort to uncover pathways that govern L-IC function, we performed single cell RNA-
sequencing on thymocytes at varying stages of T-cell leukemogenesis using our transgenic Tal1/Lmo2 model.
This approach identified a dormant DN3 cluster, marked by low Ki67 expression, which is observed in other
murine T-ALL samples. Dormant DN3 cells exhibit high Notch1, but low Myc expression. The transcriptional
signature of these cells shows enrichment of genes previously implicated in leukemia initiation or leukemia stem
cell function. Dormant DN3 cells show enrichment of the non-canonical Wnt receptor Ryk, which is reported to
maintain hematopoietic stem cell self-renewal by limiting proliferation and promoting quiescence. RYK is
overexpressed in primary pediatric T-ALL and in Tal1/Lmo2-induced murine T-ALL compared to healthy thymus.
This indicates that RYK may not be restricted to this rare subpopulation and moreover, there may be a
therapeutic window for RYK inhibition in relapsed T-ALL. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that dormant
DN3 cells are quiescent L-ICs that retain proliferative and differentiative capacity, which permits their therapy
tolerance and subsequent expansion during relapse. This proposal will identify a gene signature of dormant DN3
cells and uncover the potential role of these cells in T-ALL relapse by evaluating their L-IC function and
chemoresistance (Aim 1). Aim 2 will define the non-canonical WNT/RYK signaling network in T-ALL and uncover
the role of these pathways in dormant DN3 cells and L-IC function by testing whether inhibition of RYK reduces
the L-IC frequency of murine and patient T-ALL cells. Collectively, these studies will provide critical insight to T-
ALL heterogeneity and will lay the foundation for development of L-IC targeted therapy for relapsed disease.

 The goal of this K99/R00 proposal is to facilitate Dr. Shaobing Su's transition into the role of independent

and resilience lens and her prior research on mental health and development of vulnerable children, especially
children born to immigrants or migrants. Dr. Su seeks to expand her knowledge of the literature related to child
development and parent-child separation as well as her repertoire of methodological skills, including cultural
adaptation of theories, measures, and interventions for racial and ethnic minorities, qualitative and mixed-
method research, Community Based Participatory Research (CBPR) approaches, and grant writing.
 This CBPR-based exploratory sequential mixed-methods research comprises 3 aims and 3 studies:
 Study 1 (Aim 1) will elucidate the mental health challenges that arise in Chinese American children with a
history of early and prolonged parent-child separation; and identify potential processes that might influence
mental health. Study 1 involves semi-structured interviews with Chinese separated-reunited children (N=48,
aged 12-17) and their parents (N=48 primary caregiver parents).
 Study 2 (Aim 2) will examine mental health disparities and risks and resources between separated-reunited
children and non-separated children; and explore the relationships among separation, risk, and protective
factors at multiple levels, and affected children's mental health outcomes. Study 2 is a quantitative study
among 200 Chinese American separated-reunited children and 200 non-separated children (aged 12-17).
 Study 3 (Aim 3) will identify focal areas and potential “active ingredients” to prioritize as components for
development of a targeted intervention for affected children and families. Study 3 will use mixed-methods
analyses to integrate qualitative (Study 1, Community Advisory Board recorded discussions) and quantitative
findings (Study 2, Boston College seed grant) to seek convergence and divergence as the basis for a model of
change and integrate it into existing family strengthening models for mental health interventions.
 The CBPR-based, mixed-methods research may deepen understanding of the impact of parent-child
separation on child development and effects of multilevel risk and protective factors. Findings may inform
intervention, policy, and practices for separated-reunited Chinese American children as well as other children
affected by other forms of separation (e.g., children in institutional settings, children separated at the border).
This award will support Dr. Su's transition to independent research in parent-child separation and mental
health; and enable her to develop R01 proposals to adapt and evaluate family-strengthening interventions for
affected children or to expand the research to other child cohorts with a longitudinal sequential design.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
Pharmacologically targeting intracellular proteins is a key challenge of modern drug development, requiring
innovation and the development of new technologies. This challenge is made more difficult by the fact that many
protein targets remain beyond the reach of established drug discovery technologies because they lack easy-to-
find and unique binding pockets, possess large, and flat contact areas. Indeed, ~85-90% of the human genome
is considered “undruggable,” encoding proteins that are deemed too challenging to bind with conventional
molecules. Hence, new approaches are needed for drugging intracellular protein targets. To address this unmet
need, this project seeks to develop a new class of computationally-designed mRNA therapeutics that encode
peptide-guided protein degraders, known as ubiquibodies (uAbs), for potent and selective degradation of
historically undruggable targets not addressable by conventional drugs. Specifically, uAbs are modular,
programmable proteins consisting of a genetically engineered fusion between an E3 ubiquitin ligase, linker, and
protein/peptide guide. Following ectopic expression in cells, these heterobifunctional chimeras direct the activity
of an E3 to a protein of interest (POI), leading to polyubiquitination and subsequent degradation of the POI by
the endogenous ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (UPP). The objective of this Phase I STTR is to design
customized uAbs against β-catenin and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (CHOP), two
intracellular transcription factors that hold promise as drug targets for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), alpha-1
antitrypsin deficiency (AATD), and other liver diseases. The hypothesis of this project is that uAbs can be
designed to selectively remove cytosolic/nuclear β-catenin and CHOP, with the potential to inhibit the tumorigenic
and proteotoxic potential, respectively, of these drug targets while also limiting toxicity. The plan to address these
hypotheses includes first leveraging an artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML)-powered platform to
create designer uAbs that selectively degrade cytosolic/nuclear β-catenin and CHOP (Aim 1) and then to develop
and evaluate a lipid nanoparticle (LNP)-based strategy for systemically delivering synthetic uAb-encoding
mRNAs in cultured cells and mice. The best performing mRNA-LNP formulations will then be evaluated in mice
to assess biodistribution, efficiency and duration of target degradation, and biological impacts. Overall, the
proposed studies will demonstrate a new paradigm for drugging the proteome based on computational design
of peptide-guided uAbs, with proof-of-concept studies in this Phase I proposal focused on accelerating the
removal of two key intracellular disease drivers through LNP-mediated delivery of mRNA encoding customized
uAbs. Successful completion of this project will lead to a future Phase II application that will explore the
therapeutic potential of uAbs following systemic delivery of optimized mRNA-LNP formulations in relevant animal
models of HCC and AATD. These studies will serve to advance the development and commercialization of
UbiquiTx’s proprietary therapeutic candidates towards an IND.

A key deliverable of the 4DN consortium consists in the sharing of data that pertains to the integration of chromatin
conformation capture (3C) information with the 3-dimensional physical mapping in nuclear space of the corresponding
sequences by multiplexed FISH imaging experiments. To facilitate this integration, the 4DN Imaging Working Group
(IWG) and the Data Coordination and Integration Center (DCIC)1 have developed a data format and metadata annotation
specifications that allows standardized data exchange for multiplexed FISH/FISH Omics datasets2,3. This community
standard is called 4DN FISH Omics Format (FOF) for Ball-and-Stick Chromatin Tracing (FOF basCT)3 and allows the
exchange of processed results deriving from various imaging techniques for basCT4,5,6,7,8–10,11. The release of FOF basCT
in early 20213 has resulted in the deposition to the 4DN Data Portal of over 70 multiplexed FISH datasets2, adoption
of the format by public repositories12, 13–16, and the development of downstream processing and visualization
pipelines17–19.
Despite these advances, the production of formatted datasets and their upload to the 4DN Data Portal imposes a significant
curation and management burden, negatively impacting productivity. With this supplement, we propose to address this
challenge and significantly improve the efficiency of data exchange. This will be achieved by developing automated FISH
Omics data deposition and sharing pipelines that scientists can use both in 4DN and outside 4DN.
1. We will develop a data format and standardized annotation specifications to describe the results of volumetric Chromatin
 Tracing (vCT) FISH Omics experiments. These specifications will be built specifically to extend the already available
 FOF-basCT, be applicable to technologies such as OligoSTORM, and Oligo DNA-based Point Accumulation for
 Imaging in Nanoscale Topography (OligoDNA-PAINT)20–23, and it will incorporate specifications for the description of
 Oligopaint probes for genomic loci imaging to be compatible with existing genome browsers.
2. We will develop pipelines to ensure that laboratories within 4DN can produce and successfully transfer both FOF-bas
 and vCT (FOF-CT) datasets to the DCIC for incorporation into the 4DN Data Portal. These pipelines will include
 software tools to minimize the burden of manual curation and expedite data ingestion, Quality Control (QC) procedures
 to promote the upload of high-quality datasets, and automated rating of datasets (i.e., minimal, recommended, ideal)
 depending on standardized criteria such as the presence of quality metrics or common coordinated framework (CCF)
 nuclear mapping information.
3. We will develop prototype pipelines to establish the feasibility of sharing metadata-rich raw image data associated with
 FOF-CT results deposited to the 4DN Data Portal2 via general public repositories such as the OME-IDR12, or the BioImage
 Archive 24,25, 2.
The overall impact of the described deliverables will be to generate integrated public datasets to be used to benchmark the
development of tools for different aspects of the multiplexed FISH processing (i.e., drift and chromatic correction, single
particle detection and localization, spot fitting, filtering and calling, and feature segmentation) and post-processing
computational (i.e., machine learning classification and integrated modeling) pipelines.

depression worsens poverty, compromising economic productivity. Efforts to increase access to
depression treatment in LMIC have been hampered by low treatment uptake/engagement and weak
treatment effects. Recently, researchers & policy makers have pointed to the importance of poverty
alleviation in the fight again the global depression pandemic. Our ongoing NIMH funded study, ASHA,
is implementing an integrated poverty alleviation/depression treatment intervention for low-income

is key to improving science in this area. This application describes a fellowship training program, via the
Diversity Supplement mechanism, that will offer intensive training to a young psychologist who is the
first in her family to attend college. Ms. Shidad will participate in didactic, pragmatic, and hands on
research and training activities both in the US and in Bangladesh. She will work closely with ASHA PIs
and will conduct a small-scale study of the social network impacts of the ASHA trial. The traineeship will
support Ms. Shidad’s graduate school applications and prepare her in other ways for a career in global

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The increased incidence of autoimmune and inflammatory disorders highlights the need for improved
therapeutics to treat these diseases. Our work places RIPK1 kinase at the apex of inflammatory pathways
where it regulates a form of inflammatory cell death called necroptosis mediated by RIPK1, RIPK3 and
MLKL. In the work proposed, we will delineate novel necroptosis pathways important in autoimmunity and
immune-mediated liver injury operative in autoimmune and viral hepatitis.
We demonstrate that mice with a dendritic cell RIPK1-deficiency (Ripk1DC KO) develop inflammation and
autoimmunity; unexpectedly revealing that RIPK1 restrains necroptosis in dendritic cells (DC) in contrast to
it well established role as an initiator of necroptosis. During development, RIPK1 prevents necroptosis
mediated by the nucleic acid sensor Z-DNA binding protein (ZBP1) leading us to hypothesize that ZBP1-
mediated dendritic cell necroptosis breaks tolerance and induces autoimmunity. We will test this hypothesis
in Aim 1 by determining whether a ZBP1-deficiency prevents inflammation and autoimmunity in Ripk1DC KO
mice. We will identify the nucleic acid species bound to ZBP1 and will establish whether nucleic acid binding
is required to induce inflammation and/or autoimmunity. Nucleic acids in the Z-form are known to be highly
immunogenic and anti-Z-DNA autoantibodies occur in lupus patients; therefore, we will test genetically
whether inhibiting ZBP1 or necroptosis ameliorates disease in other autoimmune prone mice. In Aim 2, we
will investigate whether RIPK1-kinase-dependent necroptosis contributes to a mouse model of autoimmune
hepatitis (AIH) induced by the plant lectin Concanavalin A (Con A). Based on our preliminary data in
reciprocal hematopoietic chimeras we hypothesize that AIH is mediated by canonical necroptosis in
hematopoietic cells and noncanonical necroptosis in hepatocytes. Consistent with increased RIPK1 and
MLKL expression in the livers of AIH patients, our preliminary data implicate RIPK1 and MLKL but not
RIPK3 in hepatocyte cell death, leading us to hypothesize that a novel RIPK3 independent necroptosis
pathway is induced in hepatocytes. Going forward we will test this hypothesis rigorously by generating mice
that express kinase inactive RIPK1D138N or delete Ripk3 or Mlkl specifically in liver parenchymal cells. An
additional goal will be to delineate this non-canonical necroptosis pathway, by identifying the RIPK1-
interacting kinase responsible for MLKL activation in hepatocytes and to assess its contribution to AIH.
Successful completion of these Aims will elucidate the contribution(s) of these new necroptosis pathways
to autoimmunity and acute liver inflammation with the long-term goal to identify those
autoinflammatory/immune diseases that might benefit from RIPK1 kinase targeted therapy

This proposal describes the framework of an NIAID New Innovators DP2 award for Kiera Clayton, PhD. Dr.
Clayton is currently a postdoctoral fellow under the supervision of Dr. Bruce Walker at the Ragon Institute of
MGH, MIT and Harvard, whose current research focuses on T cell and NK cell-mediated killing of HIV-infected
macrophages, and the implications for HIV reservoir persistence and macrophage-mediated inflammation. In
addition to Dr. Clayton’s published work suggesting that macrophages are resistant to T cell-mediated killing,
preliminary results included in this proposal suggest that HIV exploits macrophages to evade NK cell-mediated
killing, by mechanisms distinct from those used to evade T cell responses. As macrophages also act as the
primary cellular reservoir for other chronic pathogens, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the question
remains whether macrophages provide a common “Hide-Out” for immunoevasion. Thus, the overall goal of this
proposal is to characterize the mechanisms employed by macrophages infected by different chronic pathogens
to evade immune-mediated clearance and explore the possibility of targeting a common immunoevasion
pathway to enhance T cell and NK cell killing of infected macrophages. This proposal focuses on three Research
Areas. The first Research Area will build on preliminary data to define the mechanisms by which HIV-infected
macrophages prevent NK cell-mediated killing. To quantify the resistance of macrophages infected with Mtb to
T cell and NK cell-mediated elimination and characterize the accompanying immunoevasion mechanisms, the
second Research Area will characterize the interactions between Mtb-infected macrophage and antigen-specific
T cells and NK cells. Finally, as Dr. Clayton’s published work suggests that inefficient killing of macrophages is
a result of resistance to apoptosis-inducing T cell-derived granzymes, the third Research Area will probe for the
identities of granzyme inhibitors expressed by macrophages, and subsequently knockout candidate genes to
enhance T and NK cell-mediated killing of infected macrophages. Together, these studies will provide insight
into whether targeting natural granzyme inhibitors can provide a common method to enhance immune-mediated
clearance of macrophages infected by different pathogens. The goals of this proposal are highly relevant to the
mission of NIAID, and will enhance our understanding of distinct pathogen-specific immunoevasion mechanisms
and those inherently characteristic of macrophages that allow for pathogen persistence despite strong immune
responses. Ultimately, this work will aid the design and development of therapeutics to target HIV and Mtb
infection in macrophages, and will potentiate future studies to assess how macrophage-mediated
immunoevasion contributes to persistence of other pathogens, including human cytomegalovirus.

The University of Massachusetts Chan Medical School seeks funding to continue its summer undergraduate
research program for undergraduates from groups traditionally underrepresented – by race, ethnicity, economic
and education disadvantage and disability status – in the biomedical sciences. The research training
opportunities available through this short-term training experience span the range from basic to translational to
clinical/epidemiologic research. Therefore, the program is very well suited to support the research interests of a
broad range of trainees. Many of these research training experiences are in areas supported within the research
portfolio of the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute. Importantly, UMass Chan Medical School provides a
very intensive research environment attracting almost $300 million in research funding in 2021.
The NIH funded program will support 16 trainees annually, a number readily justified by the large number of high
caliber applications received by the program each year. The program also benefits from sustained and significant
investment by UMass Chan in the form of personnel and direct financial support. This financial support provides
funds each year for an additional 10 trainees, most of whom do not meet NIH eligibility criteria. This support
additionally allows the program to provide critical activities and materials for the trainees, the costs of which are
not allowable under the NIH award.
The UMass Chan summer undergraduate research program is a highly structured residential program. Students
perform research in a group aligned with their interests. Students are introduced to critical tenets of Responsible
Conduct of Research that support rigor and reproducibility and ethical research conduct. Students enhance their
scientific communication skills through a series of small group sessions led by junior faculty and postdocs,
culminating in a poster presentation at the end of the program. A research lecture series and luncheon research
discussions expose participants to a broad range of research areas, potentially expanding the range of their
scientific interests, while also expanding their professional networks. Networking sessions with key leaders and
program directors at UMass Chan demystify the application process for doctoral degree programs and provide
additional opportunities for network growth. Program-organized social activities, to which former program
participants are invited, support social and professional networks. Program participants are also included in
institution-wide social activities at which current UMass Chan students are present, to enhance their sense of
belonging at the institution.
Participant outcomes indicate the impact of the program. Of 550 unique NIH-funded participants, 249 (45%)
have completed or are enrolled in a doctoral degree program - 185 in MD or DO programs, 54 in PhD programs,
and 10 in combined MD/PhD programs. Continued NIH funding will allow this successful program to continue for
an additional five year period.

Oligonucleotide-based therapeutics is an exciting and rapidly advancing field of research, spurred by the
groundbreaking discovery of RNA interference (RNAi) by Professor Craig Mello, Nobel Laureate, at the
University of Massachusetts Chan Medical School (UMass Chan). RNAi and antisense-based drugs have
shown clinical efficacy and are expected to become a significant class of therapeutic modalities. Fourteen
siRNA or ASO drugs have been approved, with many more in clinical development. The recent progress in
chemically modified guides for CRISPR-based therapies has also generated significant excitement. Advances
in oligonucleotide delivery to organs throughout the body, including liver, lung, central nervous system (CNS),
muscle, and kidneys, has led a growing number of investigators at UMass Chan to apply their disease and
target knowledge to develop transformative RNA-based therapeutics. The pharmacokinetic properties of
oligonucleotides are strongly influenced by their chemical structures, emphasizing the importance of advanced
modification patterns and design expertise. Unfortunately, academic investigators cannot readily access a
large number of therapeutic-quality, chemically modified oligonucleotides to identify drug leads. The RNA
Therapeutics Institute (RTI) at UMass Chan is widely recognized as a leading center in RNA chemical
innovation and translational research. Leveraging our expertise in chemistry, informatics, and delivery, we seek
to accelerate the development of innovative RNA-based technologies and therapeutics by establishing a high-
throughput production capability to synthesize 10,000 complex therapeutic RNA leads. This will allow
investigators to evaluate a large number of optimally modified oligonucleotides and identify the most potent
sequence-chemistry configurations. We are therefore seeking funds through a High-End Instrumentation Grant
to acquire the necessary equipment for high-throughput synthesis, purification, and quality control of
chemically modified RNA. The requested funds will be used to purchase state-of-the-art equipment, including
the Advion puriFlash XS520, Biolytic Dr. Oligo 192 XLc, Heated Pressure Chamber, Dr. Oligo Processor,
Agilent 1290 Infinity II Preparative LC/MSD and 6230B Time of Flight (TOF) LC/MS, Metrohm Compact Ion
Chromatograph (I.C. Flex), and Thermofisher SpeedVac SPD210. These cutting-edge instruments will allow us
to efficiently synthesize, purify, and analyze large numbers of chemically modified RNAs. This acquisition will
significantly enhance our basic and translational research programs, enabling the development of novel RNA-
based therapies for Huntington's Disease (HD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), organ rejection,
nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and other diseases, including rare/orphan diseases. The equipment will
support ongoing studies funded by 17 NIH grants and multiple grants from private foundations.

 National data from several non-communicable diseases (NCD) risk factors surveillance surveys in
Vietnam have shown disturbing increases in the prevalence of HTN between 2010 and 2020 (16% vs. 28%) in
persons aged 25-64 years old. Both urban and rural populations showed significant increases in the prevalence
of HTN over time in these surveys, though urban (15% to 31%) populations demonstrated greater negative
trends compared to rural (16% to 27%) communities. This can be attributed to increasing adverse lifestyle
practices, including unhealthy diets, physical inactivity, excessive alcohol consumption, and high levels of stress.
Urban residents were more likely to have important NCD comorbidities and reported having less time to manage
their HTN. The need for a large-scale and sustainable intervention approach for HTN control is emphasized in
the 2022-2025 national strategic plan of Vietnam. In our recently completed NIH-funded study, we developed a
multi-level, integrated approach for controlling HTN and successfully deployed it in rural northern Vietnam.
Preliminary results showed that our intervention is well-accepted and effective. We now propose to adapt this
work tailored to an urban Vietnamese setting using innovative implementation strategies to enhance intervention
delivery (mHealth platform and Integrated Health Care Delivery System). Our intervention adaptation process
will be guided by ADAPT-ITT model. Implementation and evaluation of the study will be guided by the EPIS
(Exploration, Preparation, Implementation, and Sustainment) framework. The HTN-URBAN intervention includes
three integrated components: (1) a storytelling intervention; (2) home BP self-monitoring; and (3) expanded
community health worker services.
 Our specific aims for the R61 phase are to: 1) conduct an HTN Needs Assessment (30 semi-structured
interviews) in Hai Phong city; 2) develop and refine HTN-URBAN based on the results of our HTN Needs
Assessment and the ADAPT-ITT model for adapting a proven intervention to a new setting and condition. Our
specific aims for the R33 phase are to 3) implement a cluster randomized type II Hybrid Effectiveness and
Implementation trial in 14 communities in Hai Phong, including 700 patients with uncontrolled HTN, randomized
to an intervention (HTN-URBAN of three integrated components) or comparison group (“Learn More” module -
didactic material only without stories) to assess the primary clinical effectiveness outcome (changes in BP) and
implementation outcomes including intervention acceptability, appropriateness, feasibility, adoption, and fidelity;
4) prepare for dissemination of HTN-URBAN by integration with the National Strategy on Prevention and Control
for Non-Communicable Diseases and building capacity in policy-relevant Implementation Science. This project
will address gaps in hypertension (HTN) control for adults living in urban setting in Vietnam by testing a multi-
level, evidence-based intervention with the promise of nationwide scalability and sustainability.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
Heterogeneity is a hallmark of the circulatory system and is manifest in a wide range of anatomical, cellular
and molecular differences that correlate with diverse blood vessel functions. A notable example of this
heterogeneity is found across the distinct capillary beds in multiple different organs and tissue types. These
capillary beds are the central functional unit of the circulatory system and serve as the sites for gas exchange,
filtration, hormone secretion, and immune cell trafficking. Each capillary bed is uniquely tuned to its organ-
specific function. For example, endothelial cells in liver capillaries are highly fenestrated and allow large
macromolecules to traverse their boundaries, while brain capillaries exhibit highly selective barrier function to
prevent toxic plasma components from damaging neurons. In this latter case, the function of these blood brain
barrier (BBB) capillaries is governed in part by vascular mural cells known as pericytes, which share a
basement membrane with endothelial cells. In the absence of pericytes, BBB function is lost, leading to
leakage, deficits in neurovascular flow, and eventual neuronal apoptosis. Accordingly, recent observations
indicate that pericyte loss may be a precipitating event in a number of neurodegenerative disease. Thus,
pericytes play an essential role in regulating organ-specific function of capillary beds in the circulatory system.
Despite their importance for vascular homeostasis, nothing is known about how pericyte identity is specified
and maintained during embryonic development, in contrast to most other cardiovascular cell types. By
leveraging our expertise using the zebrafish as a model system to investigate vascular development, we have
applied an integrated single cell molecular approach to identify candidate transcriptional networks that may be
responsible for establishing pericyte identity. Through this approach we have identified the first pericyte-
specific enhancer elements, including those that display organ specificity, along with cognate transcription
factors responsible for their expression. Our proposed studies will combine cutting edge genetic approaches,

regulatory programs responsible for pericyte identity. Taken together, our results will shed major new insights
into how this important cell type develops during embryogenesis.

Our proposal will examine a central mechanism of cell death pathways—the formation of large membrane
pores during the final stages of cell death. Recent studies have demonstrated that this process involves
Ninjurin1 (Ninj1), a membrane-spanning protein that multimerizes to form large membrane pores that lead to
membrane rupture. These membrane ruptures are essential for advanced signs of cell death and for the
release of larger inflammatory molecules required to mount an effective response to pathogens. The
multimerization of Ninj1 is critical for membrane rupture, but little is known about the specific mechanisms
underlying Ninj1 multimer formation or the direct implications of this oligomerization. This proposal will
determine how Ninj1 is activated by upstream steps of the cell death pathway, including caspase-8 and
caspase-1-driven signaling, and how gasdermin family members regulate this process. We will also examine
the contribution of Ninj1 activation in cell death pathways in the innate immune response to pathogens using
mouse models of Yersinia infection.
Our preliminary experiments demonstrated that Ninj1 expressed in myeloid cells is required for the host
response to Yersinia bacteria. We also showed that Ninj1 controls myeloid-cell driven defenses to Yersinia
infection in mice, underscoring the importance of Ninj1 in the innate immune response to bacterial infections.
Furthermore, our data suggest that GSDMD has a regulatory role in Ninj1 oligomerization initiated via both
caspase-8 and caspase-1. We hypothesize that GSDM proteins are modulating Ninj1 oligomerization and host
responses to caspase-8 and caspase-1 stimulations, and that Ninj1 oligomerization is a critical component in
effector-mediated immunity to Yersinia infections. Using Yersinia infections, cytokines, inhibitors, expression
systems and other tools, we will define the pathway controlling Ninj1 oligomerization during innate immune
signaling to cell death and inflammation to elucidate how this central step in multiple cell death pathways is
regulated.

 Metabolism is a well-established regulator of innate immune responses. Previous literature examined
metabolic changes upon activation of dendritic cells (DCs) by pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs)
from planktonic (free-living) bacteria, like the LPS, while little is still known about the metabolic reprogramming
induced by bacterial biofilms. Most bacterial pathogens thrive in biofilms, multicellular communities of bacteria.
Biofilms are potent virulence factors associated to recurrent and chronic infections and are resistant to DNAses,
proteases and even to antibiotics, providing a formidable challenge for clinical treatment. We have recently
reported that a bacterial amyloid termed curli, a dominant component in E. coli and Salmonella biofilms, forms a
natural complex with bacterial DNA and is a potent PAMP, activating DCs and macrophages.
 The objective of this exploratory project is to determine whether DCs acquire a specific metabolic profile
upon recognition of biofilm-specific PAMPs vs. PAMPs expressed also by planktonic (free-living) bacteria, with
the long-term goals of 1) understanding whether DCs mount distinct responses during biofilm-driven infections
vs. planktonic infections, 2) discovering new therapeutics to improve host defense. We hypothesize that
curli/DNA induce in inflammatory DCs a specific reprogramming that promotes innate and adaptive immune
responses against biofilms. This project will provide the foundation to study murine and human innate responses
to biofilms. In Aim 1, we will perform high resolution mass spectrometry to comprehensively profile the metabolic
changes that occur in DCs upon recognition of bacterial amyloid curli/DNA. We will compare these results with
better-known PAMPs LPS, CpG and Pam3CSK4, the latter two triggering the same TLR2/TLR9 that recognize
curli/DNA. We will test murine GM-CSF-monocyte-like DCs and human monocyte-derived DCs, as models of
inflammatory DCs. To confirm the metabolomics results, changes in the main metabolic pathways will be followed
using stable isotope tracing, the Seahorse Flux Analyzer, and biochemistry assays. In Aim 2, we will analyze the
transcriptome and cytokine secretome to identify the molecular pathways associated with the metabolic
reprogramming stimulated in DCs by bacterial amyloids and characterize the induced innate response. We will
compare these results with those from DCs exposed in vitro to bacterial biofilms. To start dissecting in depth the
underlying molecular mechanisms, we will study the purine salvage pathway, a metabolic pathway novel in DC
biology that was suggested by our Preliminary studies.
 This project will explore the innate immune response against bacterial biofilms through the recognition of the
most stimulatory component, the bacterial amyloids. It will indicate which metabolic pathways are candidates as
therapeutic targets to modulate immune responses to biofilms, starting with the purine salvage pathway, an
understudied pathway in DC biology, to strengthen innate responses against biofilm-driven infections.

largely unknown. Th1 immunity is the dominant mechanism of control. In contrast, how type 2 immunity affects
immunity to TB is a clinically important knowledge gap. Th2 immune responses are elicited by helminths
parasites, and half of the 180 million school age children in Sub-Saharan Africa are estimated to be infected
with helminths. Chronic helminth infection induces Th2 and Tregs, both which inhibit Th1 immunity, and impair
BCG efficacy. IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 are the canonical cytokines of Th2 cells. These cytokines are also produced
by innate cells including eosinophils and mast cells. We discovered that BCG vaccination worsens subsequent
Mtb infection in CC040 mice and is associated with the emergence of IL-4-producing cells in the lung. Our
overarching hypothesis is that IL-4 production in CC040 mice permits Mtb growth and exacerbates disease in
BCG vaccinated mice. While the mouse has been outstanding in developing immunological concepts that
translate into humans, standard inbred strains lack the genetic diversity of people. Th1 immunity develops
following Mtb infection in C57BL/6 (B6) mice, the “go to” strain for immunologists. However, B6 mice poorly
model other immune responses including Th2 and Th17 responses, and MAIT cells. To address the short-
comings of the murine TB model, we are using Collaborative Cross (CC) mice to study mechanisms of
vaccine-induced immunity against TB. CC mice are derived from eight founder strains that include wild-derived
mice. The breeding schemes captured >90% of the diversity present in the Mus species and led to the creation
of ~70 CC strains. In one of these, the CC040 strain, we detect a clinically relevant phenotype that is not
detected in traditional mouse models (i.e., B6). Using the CC040 mouse strain, we will ask how IL-4 affects
vaccine-induced protection against Mtb infection. We will determine which cell types produce IL-4 and whether
IL-4 is induced by BCG and/or Mtb infection. Next, we will measure how immunity is altered in an IL-4-sufficient
environment by performing scRNAseq of lung cells from IL-4-sufficient or depleted CC040 mice, following BCG
vaccination and Mtb infection. Two strategies will be used to determine how IL-4 affects vaccine-induced
protection against Mtb infection. Whether IL-4 is detrimental to BCG-mediated protection and heightens the
susceptibility of CC040 mice to TB will be tested by depletion of IL-4 or IL-4-producing cells. Another approach
will use genetic segregation and mapping analysis to determine the role of IL-4 signaling and identify genetic
susceptibility loci specifically driving IL-4-enhanced Mtb disease. New insights into how mast cells and
eosinophils affect TB susceptibility are changing the way we view immunity to mycobacteria. Clinical and
epidemiological data indicates that IL-4 production during chronic helminth infection could impair BCG efficacy
and immunity to TB. The CC040 strain will be an important tool to unravel how IL-4 and IL-4 producing cells
affect immunity to Mtb.

Cause Lung Pathology?
Respiratory viruses such as SARS-CoV1, Influenza and recently SARS-CoV2 (COVID-19) have caused the
major pandemics in the 21st century and influenza causes high levels of death from yearly circulating outbreaks.
T cells can target internal viral proteins, that mutate less frequently. Thus, T cell memory induced by previous
vaccination or infection can still be effective against emerging mutant viral strains. Tissue resident memory
(TRM) cells, that develop in the lung are at the first line of defense of our adaptive immune response against
respiratory infections because of their location. However, lung CD8 TRM, which are most- studied, are short-
lived. The few studies that have examined lung CD4 TRM suggest that they may decay less rapidly. We know
relatively little about lung CD4 TRM longevity and mechanisms of function, though they are known to protect
against many respiratory infections such Influenza, Sendai, B.pertussis, pneumococcal pneumonia and
tuberculosis infections. Moreover, we know little about the CD4 effectors that are precursors to the lung CD4
TRM. If CD4 lung TRM are longer-lived, they might compensate over the long-term for the rapid decline in CD8
lung TRM, thus making them good vaccine targets to provide strong more durable immunity.
A majority of the CD4 and CD8 T cells in human lung express TRM features, so it is vital to understand their
impact when they are reactivated during an immune response, both their positive effect on protection against
pathogens and negative effects on lung function and tissue damage. In many respiratory infections such as
influenza and COVID-19 there is also potential for severe lung damage leading to poor prognosis. We show that
cytotoxic CD4 T cells, that are resident effectors in the lung and that contribute to damage, can be precursors
oflung CD4 TRM. Thus, it is vital that we learn how CD4 TRM can both protect and cause lung pathology on
reactivation, especially if they are maintained long-term.
Here, we propose to identify the precursors of CD4 lung TRM from CD4 lung effectors, and better define their
protective and pathogenic potentials. We will phenotypically and molecularly characterize the CD4 TRM formed
from subsets of lung CD4 effectors. We will study their longevity and their maintenance via mechanisms such
as homeostatic proliferation and recruitment from circulation. Finally, we will study in detail their functional
mechanisms of eliciting protection vs those causing lung immunopathology by direct cytolysis, inflammation and
helper function. Understanding mechanisms/conditions driving protection and pathology by CD4 TRM will enable
design of interventions like vaccines and immunotherapies, that favor the development of protection while
minimizing pathology. Identifying precursor CD4 effectors that give rise to protective CD4 TRM will also allow us
to finetune vaccine approaches that drive generation of those CD4 effector subsets. In future studies, we will
use the knowledge gained here, to identify transcriptional networks that regulate the development of CD4 TRM
from CD4 effectors and naïve CD4.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
ADAM10 is a membrane-anchored endopeptidase that cleaves a range of membrane proteins at membrane-
proximal external sites, and thus causes the shedding of their ectodomains. We now find that HIV-1 virions
selectively incorporate considerable amounts of the active form of ADAM10. Our data indicate that ADAM10
cleaves the HIV-1 transmembrane protein gp41 within the membrane-proximal external region (MPER),
which leaves behind a C-terminal fragment (CTF) and causes the shedding of the gp41 ectodomain from
virions. Interestingly, Nef protects gp41 from cleavage by ADAM10, and thus increases the amount of virion-
associated Env glycoprotein. Furthermore, Nef-deficient HIV-1 replicates strikingly faster in the absence of
ADAM10, including in primary human CD4+ T cells. Additionally, we find that ADAM10 potently inhibits the
propagation of Nef-deficient strains bearing primary Envs from different HIV-1 clades, and that ADAM10
inhibits HIV-1 replication through its catalytic activity.
 To understand the role of ADAM10 in HIV-1 spreading, we propose to examine its effects on virus
infectivity and transmission, including the possibility that cellular ADAM10 substrates are involved. We also
propose to examine whether the suppression of gp41 cleavage by ADAM10 is a core function of Nef, and
whether it depends on the engagement of the clathrin adaptor AP-2.
 Interestingly, we have obtained a revertant with a point mutation in the gp41 MPER, the putative site of
ADAM10 cleavage, that fully rescued a Nef-deficient HIV-1 in the presence of ADAM10. We propose to test
the hypothesis that the MPER mutation protects gp41 from cleavage by ADAM10 because it alters the N-
capping propensity of the mutated residue. We also intend to examine whether the sensitivity of gp41 to
cleavage by ADAM10 correlates with the accessibility of the MPER in the unliganded Env spike.
 ADAM10 is regulated by TSPANC8 tetraspanins, which form complexes with ADAM10 and are thought
to determine its substrate specificity. We thus plan to determine the roles of individual TSPANC8 family
members in the cleavage of gp41 by ADAM10, and to explore whether Nef protects gp41 by altering the
repertoire of TSPANC8/ADAM10 complexes. We also plan to explore the possibility that Nef suppresses the
ADAM10-mediated cleavage of gp41 by reducing the exposure of phosphatidylserine, which is known to
activate ADAM10. Interestingly, this possibility is suggested by recent evidence that the Nef targets SERINC3
and SERINC5 are lipid scramblases that promote phosphatidylserine exposure on virions.
 The proposed studies have the potential to yield fundamental new insights into what constitutes a novel
mode of HIV-1 neutralization through the incorporation of a host protease. Of particular significance would be
the identification of specific TSPANC8/ADAM10 complexes as being responsible for the cleavage of gp41, as
this would offer the prospect of inactivating HIV-1 through agonists that selectively target these complexes.

E-cigarette use (vaping) in 18-24-year-olds is a public health crisis. It is an urgent public health
priority to communicate to young adults about the health harm of vaping to stop and prevent
them from vaping. However, effective communication has become challenging in the new age of
health misinformation and low trust in health experts. My goal is to investigate the role of a
trusted source and strategic message presentation to increase young adults’ acceptance of e-
cigarette education messages to impact their behavior. In this two-phased study, I will determine
an optimal source and message presentation type for young adult vapers and non-vapers,
respectively (K99) and examine the effects of messages optimized for source and presentation
on young adults’ vaping cessation and vaping prevention (R00). In phase 1 (K99), I will use a
multi-method approach to examine two source (expert and peer) and two message presentation
types (one-sided and two-sided) to identify the optimal message type for each vaping status
population. First, I will use crowdsourcing testing to collect self-report measures on message
acceptance, source trust, message reactance, and harm perceptions. Second, I will use
psychophysiological testing to measure participants’ eye-tracking, heart rate, and skin
conductance to assess their visual attention, orienting responses, and arousal during message
exposure. I will produce a single dataset integrating the crowdsourced and psychophysiological
data to determine the optimal source and presentation type for vapers and non-vapers. In phase
2 (R00), I will use a text messaging intervention in a randomized trial to examine the behavioral
effects of messages optimized for source and presentation to one’s vaping status (vapers and
non-vapers). Participants in each vaping status will be randomized to either the treatment
(receiving e-cigarette education messages with a source and presentation type optimized to
one’s vaping status) or control arm (receiving non-tobacco health messages) via text messaging
over the course of 6 months. I will examine vaping cessation rates among vapers and vaping
initiation rates among non-vapers. Results will inform the public health communication
campaign development and may apply to other public education campaigns to reduce tobacco
use in young people.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Hypertension in pregnancy is highly prevalent and increasing in the United States, and 40% of maternal deaths
involve women with hypertension. In adults from racial/ethnic minority groups, hypertension is two-fold more
prevalent and leads to higher rates of preeclampsia and stroke, thus resulting in devastating health
consequences in the infant and mother alike. The time required for frequent in-person visits, inadequate
counseling, and the asymptomatic nature of hypertension are major barriers to effective blood pressure (BP)
control in pregnant women. These issues can be addressed through home BP monitoring (HBPM), which holds
the potential to reduce preventable and devastating clinical events while also proven to reduce racial inequities
in pregnant women. Obstetric societies recommend HBPM for all pregnant women with hypertension, but our
pilot work suggests that rates of HBPM counseling and uptake are low. With the increasing use of mobile health
apps in pregnancy, there is an opportunity for digital health approaches with culturally appropriate storytelling to
improve HBPM and allow pregnant women with hypertension to learn from others with similar lived experiences.
This K23 Award proposes to develop Moms@Home, a digital health approach to support HBPM in pregnant
women with hypertension. Moms@Home will integrate storytelling videos with a Social Cognitive Theory-based
proven approach to support behavior change and address the cultural and literacy needs of a diverse population
of pregnant women. Incorporating storytelling with a successful digital health approach may increase the
adoption of HBPM. Guided by Patient and Clinician Advisory Groups, Aim 1 will adapt the existing mobile health
app MyDataHelpsTM to create Moms@Home for pregnant women with hypertension by incorporating stories from
women with similar lived experiences. Aim 2 will refine the Moms@Home components with obstetric caregiver
and patient interviews. Aim 3 will pilot test the Moms@Home approach in pregnant women with hypertension,
enriched in those from racial/ethnic minority groups, to assess HBPM adherence, feasibility, and acceptability.
Beyond the research plan, the K23 will provide Dr. Kovell with advanced research training, protected time, and
mentoring to become an independent physician-scientist focused on improving outcomes for pregnant women
with hypertension. Dr. Kovell will be guided by experienced mentors with expertise in digital health and study
design (Dr. McManus), behavior change (Dr. Lemon), peripartum/women’s health (Dr. Moore Simas), storytelling
and health equity (Dr. Allison), and biostatistics (Dr. Person). Her advisory team are experts in hypertension,
clinical trials, and informatics. In addition, her comprehensive career development plan will lead to a Master of
Science in Clinical Investigation degree and expertise in digital health, behavior change, and clinical trials. This
K23 award will set the stage for Dr. Kovell’s future R01 application examining digital behavioral health
interventions on BP control for pregnant women with hypertension. This innovative and scalable proposal has
tremendous potential to positively impact and support women with hypertension through healthy pregnancies.

The overarching goal of this proposal is to gain a deeper understanding of oligodendrocyte progenitor cell (OPC)
phagocytosis and determine how it compares to the phagocytic ability of microglia and its relevance for neurological
disease. Oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) are a pool of progenitors found in the adult brain that give rise to
mature, myelinating oligodendrocytes throughout life. Recent work has established that OPCs function as phagocytes
and engulf synapses within both the developing and adult brain. This challenges the long-held notion that the sole
function of OPCs is to generate new oligodendrocytes and establishes a role for OPCs in synapse pruning, similar to
microglia. However, there is currently no understanding of how OPC phagocytosis impacts their progenitor function or
how their phagocytic function compares to microglia. It is also unknown if OPCs function as phagocytes in the context of
neurodegeneration. I will now use a combination of in vitro and in vivo phagocytosis assays and live cell imaging to
compare OPC and microglial phagocytosis under steady-state conditions and during neurodegeneration and determine
how phagocytosis impacts OPC function as progenitor cells. In Aim 1, I will use in vitro phagocytosis assays coupled with
live cell imaging, OPC differentiation analyses, and RNA-sequencing to compare microglia and OPC phagocytosis of
synaptic substrates and determine how phagocytosis impacts OPC differentiation. In Aim 2, I will utilize an animal model
relevant to multiple sclerosis (MS) where the Schafer lab has shown early synapse loss and AAV-driven inhibition of
complement C3 deposition to determine if OPCs function as phagocytes in the context of neurodegeneration, and if this
phagocytosis is complement C3-dependent. The proposed studies will build on emerging work that challenges the
current thinking that microglia are the primary phagocytes of the CNS. It will reveal the role of OPC phagocytosis in
modulating the differentiation capacity of OPCs. It will also determine if OPC phagocytosis is dependent on the
deposition of the complement protein C3. These results will have implications for neurodegenerative diseases, as lack of
OPC differentiation is observed in multiple neurodegenerative states. Additionally, complement is now a target for
therapeutic intervention in a variety of neurological diseases, so understanding how this pathway regulates other cells of
the brain is essential for the effective use of these therapeutics. Finally, the experiments outlined here combine my
strength in OPC biology from graduate school with the expertise in microglia and mechanisms of phagocytosis in my
postdoctoral lab. Together, these studies will give me ideal training to achieve my goal of becoming an independent
researcher studying glia-glia interactions in neurodegeneration.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Project Abstract:
Certain viruses in the picornaviridae family, specifically enterovirus-D68 (EV68), have emerged as global health
concerns over the last decade with severe symptomatic infections with EV68 able to result in long lasting
neurological deficits and death. There are currently no US Food and Drug Administration approved drugs for any
non-polio enterovirus, highlighting the need to develop strategies against these lethal enteroviral strains. One
particularly attractive class of potential drugs are small molecules inhibitors, which can act as direct-acting
antiviral (DAA) inhibitors towards the conserved active site of EV68 3C protease. This main viral protease is a
cysteine protease conserved in the 3C family, responsible for cleaving eight sites along the viral polyprotein,
which is essential for viral propagation. DAAs designed to target 3C proteases can potentially achieve robust
inhibition across enterovirus species. However, as drug resistance in viruses can be prevalent, it is paramount
to design inhibitors less susceptible to resistance mutations. It was demonstrated previously in the Schiffer Lab
that when bound to protease, viral substrates occupy a conserved three-dimensional volume called the substrate
envelope. It was also demonstrated that inhibitors that extend beyond the substrate envelope are more
susceptible to drug resistance mutations. By utilizing the substrate envelope and cocrystal structures of the
proteases, DAAs designed to fit within the three-dimensional consensus volume as naturally occurring substrates
will interact primarily with functionally important residues and be less susceptible to drug resistance mutations.
The central hypothesis of this proposal is that cocrystallization of EV68 3C protease with its natural substrates
will enable the calculation of the substrate envelope to inform on substrate specificity, which will also aid in the
design of robust pan-3C-protease inhibitors. In Aim 1, I will determine the cocrystal structures of EV68 3C
protease bound to viral substrates. I will then use these structures to elucidate the molecular mechanism of
substrate specificity for EV68 3C protease and calculate the substrate envelope. These data will aid in small-
molecule design to create DAAs with improved resilience to mutations that can confer drug resistance. In Aim 2,
I will design and test novel DAAs that target EV68 3C protease. I will first characterize previously designed
inhibitors for other 3C and 3C-like proteases with the substrate envelope to establish a starting compound based
on potency. Inhibitors based on the scaffold will be designed, synthesized, and tested in a FRET-based enzyme
inhibition assay. Crystallization of novel potent compounds with EV68 3C and their characterization within the
substrate envelope will assess inhibitors’ susceptibility to drug resistance mutations. Overall, this study aims to
develop a robust, novel compounds with resistance-thwarting protease inhibition against the emerging pathogen
that is EV68.

HIV and food insecurity pose severe and interrelated problems in Latin America and the Caribbean, including
in the Dominican Republic (DR), where HIV ranks as one of the top 5 causes of death and our prior studies
have found that nearly 70% of people with HIV (PWH) have moderate or severe food insecurity. Despite the
established, detrimental role of food insecurity on poor HIV treatment outcomes, evidence on sustainable
interventions that address the cycle of food insecurity and poor HIV health is scarce. To address this gap, we
developed and piloted ProMeSA (through an R34 grant), an integrated urban gardens and peer nutritional
counseling intervention, and found it feasible, acceptable, and with preliminary efficacy at 6 and 12 months of
improving food security and HIV virologic suppression. The purpose of this five-year study is to conduct a fully-
powered cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) of ProMeSA to assess intervention efficacy evaluated over a
longer period (18 months) as well as mediators and barriers and facilitators to intervention uptake,
implementation, and sustainability. The specific aims are: (1) Determine the efficacy of an integrated urban
gardens and peer nutritional counseling intervention on the primary outcome of HIV viral suppression
[undetectable HIV viral load (VL)] and secondary outcomes of ART adherence and HIV care retention care
among people with food insecurity across diverse regions in the DR; (2) Examine the intervention effects on
intermediate outcomes posited to mediate the impact of ProMeSA on ART adherence, care retention, and viral
suppression; (3) Evaluate process-related factors associated with intervention uptake and implementation
(facilitators, barriers, fidelity, and replication costs) to inform future scale-up. The trial will include 20 HIV clinics
randomized to intervention or usual care control (n=25 per clinic; 500 total study participants). VL and other
key outcomes will be assessed at baseline, and 6-, 12- and 18-months. Following our intervention causal
framework and pilot findings, we hypothesize that ProMeSA will improve food security and diet quality and
reduce stigma and competing needs, which in turn will improve HIV clinical outcomes. The predominant causal
paths identified will inform tailoring ProMeSA to enhance impact in future dissemination and implementation. In
addition, we will collect extensive quantitative and qualitative data on intervention implementation and
participant experiences with the intervention across diverse settings and participants to inform scale-up. The
study involves a partnership among researchers from the University of Massachusetts Amherst, University of
California, San Francisco, RAND, and the Universidad Autonóma de Santo Domingo as well as the Dominican
Ministries of Agriculture and Public Health, the Dominican National HIV/AIDS Council, and the United Nations
World Food Program. To our knowledge, this will be the first full-scale trial to integrate nutritional counseling
with food-generating activities among PWH with food insecurity, in support of national and international goals
to achieve viral suppression and reduce the disease- and economic burden of HIV.

 Suicide is a leading cause of death worldwide, accounting for nearly 800,000 deaths each year.1,2
Suicide rates continue to increase in the U.S.3 Most research on suicide risk factors has identified static,
dispositional factors.4 These data inform us about groups at actuarial risk, but do very little to predict with useful
precision when people will have suicidal thoughts or act on suicide thoughts. Thus, there is an urgent need to
identify proximal risk factors for suicide risk.
 Two of the leading factors distally associated with increased suicide risk are dysfunctional emotional
responses5 and decision-making deficits.6 Suicidal individuals have poorer reinforcement learning,6,7
demonstrating impaired ability to learn and modify behavior in response to reward and punishment. Individuals
at high risk for suicide (i.e., borderline personality disorder) also show difficulties learning from punishment and
reward,8,9 and the PI’s data show that negative emotions uniquely impair learning in such high-risk populations
relative to healthy and clinical controls.10 It is necessary to understand the interactive effects of emotion and
reinforcement learning as factors elevating near-term risk for suicidal thoughts and behaviors.
 Therefore, the proposed study examines both emotional and cognitive processes associated with suicidal
thoughts and behaviors among 170 patients with a range of suicidal risk recently treated in an emergency
department for a suicidal crisis. Using innovative ecological momentary assessment methods (EMA), the
proposed study will examine behavioral measures of reinforcement learning and both physiological and
subjective measures of momentary emotions. Aim 1 identifies the main and interactive effects of emotional
responses, reinforcement learning, and emotion-related decrements in learning on recent suicidal thoughts and
behaviors among suicidal patients recently seen in the emergency department. Aim 2 examines how emotions
and learning interact to predict momentary suicidal thoughts and behaviors over four weeks. Aim 3 tests emotion-
related decrements in learning as prospective predictors of future suicide risk over a six-month follow-up.
 The research team (PI: Dixon-Gordon, Co-Is: Ammerman, Boudreaux, Rathlev; Consultants: Hackel;
Collaborator: Laws) has access to world-class expertise, with extensive experience recruiting suicidal
participants from medical settings, EMA, computational modeling, and experimental psychopathology.
 The most important challenge facing suicide prevention today is unraveling the complex emotional and
cognitive proximal drivers that transform nascent suicide risk into action. Combining state-of-the-art behavioral
measures and EMA, we will tease apart the complex longitudinal relations between dysfunctional emotional
responses, reduced capacity to learn from reward and punishment, and fluctuations in suicidal thoughts and
behaviors. Given the high societal costs of suicide, this work has important health significance. Findings will
inform the development of treatments that target emotion dysfunction and learning in samples at-risk for suicide.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Genetic analyses of polygenic brain disorders, such as autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) and schizophrenia
(SZ), have revealed “synaptic dysfunction” as a key cellular substrate for these disorders. Yet, translating this
synaptic hypothesis to in vitro disease modeling and extracting disease-relevant biological information has
been challenging. The PI has previously established a human neuronal model of SZ, combining isogenic
genome engineering, patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), and induced neuronal
differentiation (iN cells). Human neurons bearing mutations in the synaptic cell adhesion molecule Neurexin-1
(NRXN1, 2p16.3), a bona fide risk allele for SZ, display deficits in excitatory synaptic strength and
neurotransmitter release probability as well as a consistent upregulation of calcium/calmodulin-dependent
serine protein kinase (CASK) protein level, by which the mechanism is currently not understood. It remains
unclear how these phenotypes arise and lead to synaptic pathology and abnormal neuronal networks
implicated in the disease. In this grant, we aim to understand the cell type- and developmental-specific
functions of NRXN1-CASK interaction in normal synapse development and their mechanistic contributions to
SZ. Using synaptic molecules as a proxy, we will dissect how disruptions in the synaptic pathway can prime or
actively participate in SZ. We will achieve this by studying aberrant CASK signaling in NRXN1 mutant
background (Aim 1), investigating CASK’s normal function at human synapses using CASK KO induced
neurons (Aim 2) and by revealing key cellular events mediated by NRXN1 and CASK during human forebrain
development using KO cortical spheroid models (Aim 3). Our work integrates techniques in imaging,
electrophysiology, biochemistry and single cell RNA-seq with rigorous experimental designs using isogenic
engineered and patient-derived iPSCs from multiple genetic and gender backgrounds, differentiation of pure
induced neuronal subtypes with defined synaptic characteristics and differentiation of 3-D cortical spheroids
with characterized cellular features. Findings of this grant will provide mechanistic understanding of the
molecular and cellular underpinnings of neuropsychiatric disorders and such information will translate to other
disorders of the synapse, including intellectual disability, ASDs, and bipolar and mood disorders.

Heparin is arguably the most versatile biopolymer, capable of interacting with and modulating the behavior of an
impressive variety of biomolecules even outside of its native environment (mast cell granules). A large fraction
of heparin interactome in the human body are key players in a variety of physiological processes (including
several pathologies) and are considered high-value therapeutic targets, although at present antithrombin
remains the only protein whose interaction with heparin has been successfully exploited in medicine. Successful
exploitation of heparin’s unique versatility for other therapeutic purposes critically depends on the ability to
characterize its interactions with relevant proteins; however, specific molecular mechanisms remain elusive
outside of the very few extensively studied systems. In the previous period of support, we developed powerful
analytical tools capable of providing information on protein/heparin interactions at the whole molecule level, as
well as identifying specific structural motifs within highly heterogeneous heparin macromolecules that enable
their association with specific proteins. Building upon this success, we now propose to focus our inquiry on
understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying etiology of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), a
serious (and potentially fatal) immune disorder affecting up to 5% of patients receiving heparin as an
anticoagulant. Despite the central role played by heparin in formation of antigenic aggregates that may lead to
development of HIT, relatively little is known about the specific molecular mechanisms governing these
interactions. This not only creates a tremendous challenge vis-a-vis the ability to design efficient anti-HIT
therapeutic strategies, but also prevents a reliable prognosis of the occurrence of this pathology. Recognizing
the importance of multiple factors that may modulate interaction of heparin with relevant proteins (mostly platelet
factor 4, PF4), we will use a multi-level strategy to study the mechanism of PF4/heparin association, architecture
of these aggregates and specific features that make them immunogenic and trigger the onset of HIT. The work
will be carried out in close collaboration with the Hematology team at McMaster University Health Centre headed
by Dr. I. Nazy, a leading expert in the field of thrombocytopenia and thrombosis. This knowledge will catalyze
efforts to develop reliable diagnostic and prognostic tools for HIT, and will be critical for designing safe and
effective therapeutic intervention strategies.

Arsenic contamination in the food chain is a global health problem and causes damage to most human organs.
A significant need exists to develop approaches for addressing environmental arsenic. The long term goal is to
develop a plant-based phytoremediation approach for contaminated land that is cost-effective and ecologically
friendly as an alternative to conventional remediation methods. The objective of this study is to develop a
genetics-based phytoremediation strategy for arsenic uptake, translocation, detoxification, and
hyperaccumulation into the fast-growing, high biomass, non-food crop Crambe abyssinica. Nanosulfur will be
utilized to modulate the bioavailability and phytoextraction of As from soil and to increase the storage capacity
via enhanced sulfur assimilation. The engineered Crambe will be evaluated for removing arsenic from the soil in
laboratory, greenhouse, and field conditions. Our central hypothesis is that organ-specific expression of genes,
which control the transport, oxidation state, and binding of As, can be tuned to yield efficient extraction and
hyperaccumulation into above-ground plant tissues. To test our hypothesis, we propose the following specific
aims. 1) Genetically engineer Crambe abyssinica lines for co-expressing bacterial ArsC, gECS, and AtABCC1
and RNAi suppression of endogenous arsenate reductase CaACR2; 2) Evaluate the engineered Crambe lines
for metal(loids) tolerance and accumulation; 3) Synthesize and apply nanosulfur to modulate the bioavailability,
phytoextraction, and accumulation of toxic metal(loids); and 4) Conduct a pilot field study of engineered Crambe
lines for phytoextraction on a contaminated site. After initial screening in tissue culture media supplemented with
metals, the best performing quadruple gene stacked (ArcS+gECS+AtABCC1+CaACR2Ri) Crambe lines with wild
type controls will be tested using contaminated soils with arsenic as well as co-contaminants in greenhouse. A
pilot field-scale study will then be carried out at a site contaminated with arsenic. The soil will be extensively
characterized, and analysis for metal content and arsenic speciation will be determined using ICP/MS, HPLC-
ICP/MS as well as XANES (X-ray Absorption Near-Edge Spectroscopy). Last, soil amendments with engineered
nanosulfur will be used to evaluate the impacts on soil structure and contaminant availability and phytoextraction.
Nanosulfur will also be foliarly applied to plants to increase the metal storage capacity via enhanced sulfur
assimilation. The expected outcome of this project is a mechanistic understanding of the biogeochemical and
plant processes of arsenic remediation that connects key soil characteristics with the efficiency of phytoextraction
and hyperaccumulation of arsenic. The results will have an immediate and important positive impact because
the knowledge generated from this study will enable efficient and effective phytoremediation approaches to
minimize or remove arsenic contamination in the food chain and enhance public health.

Early life stage exposures to toxicants can result in islet malformations, which may predispose individuals to
diabetes. The glutathione redox microenvironment plays fundamental roles in embryonic development and cell
signaling, perturbation of which can result in functional or structural alterations that only become apparent with
subsequent stress or age. Surprisingly little is known about how embryos respond to oxidative stress, or the
impact of toxicant exposures on pancreatic β-cell development. This project takes a multi-level approach using
state-of-the-art techniques to elucidate the complex pathophysiological mechanisms by which exposures to
Per-and-polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) that cause oxidative stress derail islet development, and the
consequences for β-cell function. We test the central hypothesis that deviations from the GSH redox
microenvironment and aberrant activation of the transcription factor Nrf2- at the wrong place and the wrong
time- impair β-cell development and function. There are three overarching goals of this project: 1) to deepen
our understanding of the role of Nrf2 activation in embryonic β-cells and islet development; 2) ascertain the
impact of PFAS on insulin biosynthesis; and 3) identify β-cell fragility and bioindicators of later-life metabolic
impacts that can be translated to human health. We will use transgenic zebrafish, confocal microscopy and
immunofluorescence, redox proteomics and insulin misfolding assays, and cultured β-cells to investigate
exposures to two common PFAS (PFOS, PFHxS), and a legacy aqueous film-forming foam (AFFF). This work
will have a sustained and powerful impact on the fields of developmental toxicology, redox biology, and the
developmental origins of health and disease and provides critical advances towards developing science-based
PFAS guidelines, targets for clinical interventions, and public health policies.

Targeting of Bioorthogonal Chemotherapeutic Nanozymes to Tumor-Associated Macrophages
 In our proposed research we will use bioorthogonal chemistry to target tumor-associated macrophages
(TAMs) in breast cancer, using bioorthogonal chemistry to turn them into ‘drug factory’ platforms for generation
of chemotherapeutics at the tumor site. We will use our ‘nanozyme’ platform to encapsulate and protect transition
metal catalysts (TMCs) within the monolayer of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). These nanozymes will be targeted
the mannose receptor strongly upregulated in TAMs. Systemic delivery of these nanozymes is anticipated to
provide effective localization to TAMs that are highly accessible in tumors. Subsequent administration of non-
toxic prodrugs will then provide uncaging of the chemotherapeutic localized to the tumor site.
 In our proposed research we will optimize the activity of our nanozyme platform. We will then engineer the
nanozymes for selective TAM uptake through ‘stealth’ zwitterionic coating and suitable targeting elements. The
targeting and therapeutic efficacy of the nanozymes will be quantified in vitro using mono- and co-culture models,
Optimized particles will then be downselected for in vivo evaluation. Our specific aims are:
Aim 1: Fabrication of Bioorthogonal Nanozymes. Goal: Engineering of monolayer structure to provide highly
 active and stable nanozymes. We will fabricate nanozymes coated with a zwitterionic layer to minimize
 non-specific uptake and mannose to target TAMs. We will optimize catalyst loading and stability in serum,
 and determine catalyst reactivity with prodrugs.
Aim 2: In Vitro Activity and Targeting Studies. Hypothesis: Targeted nanozymes will provide highly cell-selective
 activation of prodrugs. We will quantify the intracellular activity of nanozymes in cells through catalytic
 uncaging of prodyes and prodrugs. Targeting efficacy to TAMs will assessed versus unpolarized
 macrophages and other cells, and in vitro therapeutic efficacy determined using co-culture models,
 optimizing the system based on specificity, efficacy/therapeutic window, and timing.
Aim 3: Targeting of Prodrug Activation In Vivo. Hypothesis: Targeted nanozymes will localize prodrug activation
 to tumor sites, providing highly effective tumor therapy. We will use systemic injection of mannose-
 targeted nanozymes to activate profluorophores and prodrugs at tumor sites using 4T1 orthotopic breast
 carcinoma models. Quantitative tumor and intratumoral nanozyme distributions will be obtained using
 inductively-coupled mass spectrometry, and efficacy quantified by tumor size and mouse health.
 The overall goal of this project is to perform therapeutic ‘jiu-jitsu’, using TAMs that normally protect tumors
to provide launch points for highly localized therapeutic delivery to tumors. This bioorthogonal therapeutic
strategy is expected to reduce off-target effects and increase therapeutic efficacy relative to current
chemotherapeutic approaches.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Abstract/Summary:
The vertebrate craniofacial skeleton is a dynamic organ that arises and is maintained through an
intricate balance of genetic and environmental inputs. Disruptions to either can lead to deleterious
health outcomes. While significant progress has been made toward understanding the genetic and
cellular mechanisms that underlie early craniofacial patterning, much less is known about the basis for
craniofacial variation that manifests over extended periods of development, and depends upon the
environmental context in which it occurs. Whether it's the physical interactions between cells and
tissues within the developing embryo, or the mechanic forces imposed on the system, these contexts
will determine how genetically-encoded systems unfold over time to determine craniofacial geometry.
 Implicit to these ideas is feedback in the system. Feedback is how disparate developmental units
come together to form integrated functional systems - e.g., reciprocal signaling between adjacent but
developmentally distinct tissues. It is also necessary for normal growth and homeostasis in kinetic
systems - e.g., progenitor cells must sense environmental inputs, including mechanical load, and adjust
developmental processes accordingly. Broadly speaking this proposal seeks to understand how both
types of feedback are regulated at the genetic level. In doing so, three specific questions will be
addressed: (1) What are the genes that contribute to craniofacial shape? (2) Do they exert their effects
on more than one tissue, either via pleiotropy or as part of the same signaling pathway? (3) How do
these loci interact with the environment, via mechanosensing, to affect variation in facial form?
 Cichlid fishes will be used as the experimental model, as they have undergone extensive
evolutionary modifications of their skulls and jaws in a very brief period of time, making them ideal for
genetic/genomic mapping. Cichlids are also well known for their capacity to remodel their jaws under
different foraging environment, but not all cichlids share this ability, and thus plasticity itself is
genetically determined and has diverged in this system. Cichlids therefore represent an ideal model to
identify and parse the genetic, environmental, and GxE effects that underlie craniofacial variability. This
proposal leverages these experimental attributes, and integrates advanced phenotypic, genotypic and
functional tools to provide a more holistic understanding of the mechanisms that underlie craniofacial
shape.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：SUMMARY
Sound localization is a fundamental auditory ability that is facilitated by differences in the sound reaching each
ear. Localization is important for safety and for auditory awareness in natural 3D environments. Binaural
hearing also supports spatial release from masking, where detection and recognition are improved by spatially
separating the primary source – the target – and interfering sources – the masker. Spatial release from
masking is critical for speech recognition in noisy backgrounds, especially when the background contains
competing speech. What we do not understand yet is the relationship between these two phenomena of
binaural hearing – localization and spatial release from masking. The studies in this project ask whether sound
localization and spatial release from masking arise from the same binaural mechanisms but are otherwise not
closely related, or whether sound localization is the basis of spatial release from masking, particularly in
situations were targets and maskers are highly confusable with one another. It is an important question,
because listener complaints about hearing difficulties in noise might well be due to poor sound localization,
although this is not evaluated in clinical practice. While there have been hints of a causal relationship in the
literature, the question is a difficult one to answer and the field has not come to a consensus. This three-year
project will be the first that we are aware of to singularly and comprehensively focus on the relationship
between sound localization and spatial release from masking, using rigorous psychoacoustic methods with
recently developed signal processing tools and stimuli that dissociate binaural difference cues and perceived
intracranial location. The findings will help us make sense of the conflicting literature that has been difficult to
interpret, and will move the field toward theoretical and practical advances that will help inform professional
management of hearing loss and its consequences for listening in noise.

 Aromatase inhibitors (AIs) are drugs that inhibit estrogen synthesis and that are prescribed to prevent
the recurrence of estrogen responsive breast cancers. However, AIs, such as the commonly prescribed Letrozole
(LET), are associated with severe side-effects that further burden the quality of life, including insomnia, hot
flashes, depressive symptoms and cognitive deficits. The precise mechanisms by which AIs may give rise to
these CNS symptoms remain unclear and difficult to study in humans, as control for individual differences in
disease severity, treatment history and experienced stress is lacking. Furthermore, AI treatment is recommended
for 3 to 5 years, yet little is known about the effects of long-term AI use on the brain and behavior, especially
with regards to age-related cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk. We propose to develop a primate
model for AI-induced CNS effects to advance our knowledge in this area and facilitate the design of novel
therapeutics.
 This application uses the marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), a small primate with a brain architecture, sleep
patterns, cognitive abilities, emotional responses and thermoregulation patterns that are comparable to those of
humans (1) to study the effects of chronic LET use on the brain and behavior and (2) to test whether DHED, a
prodrug that delivers E2 selectively to the brain, can effectively and safely prevent LET-associated adverse
effects.
 To achieve these aims, middle-aged male and female marmosets treated with LET, LET + DHED or
Vehicle for 3 years will be studied longitudinally for changes in sleep/wake patterns, cognitive performance,
emotional regulation, and thermoregulation. The monkeys will be outfitted with an activity monitor for sleep/wake
patterns analysis. Cognitive function will be assessed via an automated computerized battery. Thermal imaging
will be used to measure changes in facial skin temperature during a thermal challenge. Emotional regulation will
be assessed by measuring heart rate variability and facial skin temperature in monkeys viewing emotional and
neutral videos. Following these in vivo behavioral assessments, analyses of brain tissues from underlying brain
regions (hypothalamus, hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, locus coeruleus) will be carried out to quantify gene
expression of selected genes, tauopathies, β-amyloid deposition and neuronal excitability.
 The results will have important translational applications for AI-treated patients by (1) characterizing the
effects of AIs on multiple neural and behavioral outcomes; (2) determining whether long-term estrogen
suppression promotes the development of an AD-like phenotype and (3) whether providing the brain with an
alternate source of estrogen can counteract the adverse effects of AIs on the brain and behavior.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
CD8 T cells play a critical role in the elimination of infected and cancerous host cells. The success of these
immune responses depends on the proper maintenance (survival and proliferation) and precise differentiation of
CD8 T cells. Upon antigen stimulation, activated antigen-specific CD8 T cells undergo clonal expansion and
differentiate into effector lymphocytes with cytolytic function. Although the majority of effector cells die after
antigen clearance, a few antigen-specific cells survive and form long-lived protective memory CD8 T cells.
However, during chronic infection and cancer, the immune response is often compromised: CD8 T cells exhibit
defects in survival and proliferation, fail to form memory cells and instead are diverted to differentiate into
exhausted cells which are characterized by the loss of effector function. Thus, it is of utmost importance to
understand the underlying mechanisms that regulate the maintenance and differentiation of CD8 T cells. We
have already demonstrated that let-7-mediated posttranscriptional mechanism controls the differentiation and
function of effector T cells. Furthermore, our preliminary results suggest that modulation of let-7 levels have a
profound impact on the maintenance of T cells, memory formation and diversion into exhaustion. To investigate
the molecular mechanisms of let-7 regulation in CD8 T cells we propose the following aims:
Aim-1 will determine the molecular basis of let-7-mediated effects on CD8 T cell maintenance: bcl-2-dependent
survival and cdc34-driven proliferation. Aim-2 will dissect let-7-mediated mechanisms that guide CD8 T cell
differentiation: Eomes-dependent and Eomes-independent molecular programs. To address these aims we will
analyze the maintenance and differentiation of CD8 T cells with different levels of let-7 microRNAs into effector,
memory and exhausted T lymphocytes using infection and tumor models. We expect to identify novel
posttranscriptional mechanisms that regulate the outcome of CD8 T cell-mediated immune responses. It is
anticipated that these experiments will define let-7 as a new therapeutic target.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Various forms of chronic distress have been linked with premature aging, and development of cardiometabolic
diseases (CMD), which are leading causes of death for older adults. Both chronic distress and CMD conditions
are strongly linked with risk of Alzheimer's Disease and Alzheimer's Disease-Related Dementias (AD/ADRD).
While metabolic changes affecting vascular health are proposed as a key pathway driving the relationship
between chronic distress and major diseases of aging, understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying
such metabolic changes is limited. High-throughput technologies permit simultaneous measurement of
hundreds of metabolites in plasma (“metabolomics”) and provide a broad picture of an individual’s metabolic
profile. In our first funding cycle, we developed and validated a liquid chromatography-tandem mass
spectrometry (LC-MS)-based metabolomic score of chronic distress (anxiety and depression), in independent
data sets of largely non-Hispanic White women; this score was associated with higher risk of incident CMD. In
this renewal, using cutting edge metabolomic and biostatistical approaches along with several additional cohort
studies, we propose to extend our initial findings and address the following specific aims: (1) Strengthen our
existing chronic distress metabolite-score by adding novel, previously unknown metabolites strongly
associated with the distress phenotype, and biochemically identify these validated but unknown metabolites to
provide new mechanistic insight; (2) Assess our chronic distress metabolomic score (and its components) in
key populations including African-American (AA) and Hispanic men and women and White men, and optimize
the score in each population. We will also evaluate associations of the score (and components) with CMD and
secondarily AD/ADRD risk in AA men and women, White men, and preliminarily in Hispanic men and women,
and (3) Evaluate if chronic distress influences the distress-related metabolite score using causal methods and
evaluate the distress-metabolite score as a potential mediator of the relationships of chronic distress with CMD
risk and secondarily with AD/ADRD risk. We will achieve our aims by leveraging the robust data resources of
five prospective studies: the Jackson Heart Study (n=5,306; 100% AA men and women), the Multi-Ethnic
Study of Atherosclerosis (n=6,814; 39% White, 28% AA, 22% Hispanic, 12% Asian-American men and
women), the Nurses’ Health Study (NHS; n=121,700, 98% White women), the Women’s Health Initiative
(n=161,808 women; 18% non-White), PREDIMED (n=7,447; White men and women). Each cohort has
similarly assessed chronic distress, blood metabolomic profiles, relevant covariates, CMD and dementia risk
outcomes over up to 20 years of follow-up. NHS and MESA also have genetics data and repeated
metabolomics measures. This work will extend our understanding of biologic pathways underlying chronic
distress and their association with subsequent CMD and dementia risk among both women and men and
across racial and ethnic groups.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Slightly over 1 in 5 children in the United States are growing up in a household that speaks a language other
than English. For these children, developing bilingual skills will allow them to communicate both with family
members who have limited English skills and with English-speaking teachers and peers. However, for children
with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), there is limited research about how to facilitate their bilingual
development. Professionals and parents have often assumed that learning two languages would be too
challenging, especially for children with minimal spoken language skills. While several studies over the past
decade have demonstrated that bilingual exposure is not detrimental for language development in children with
ASD, these studies have focused mostly on the acquisition of English rather than examining factors that
promote development of both languages. Furthermore, bilingual studies have generally excluded children with
minimal/low verbal skills. The proposed sequential mixed-methods project places a new emphasis on
variability within the bilingual experiences of children with ASD and their families. It seeks to identify factors
associated with children’s skills in both languages, as well as their social-cognitive skills such as perspective-
taking and cognitive flexibility. The quantitative phase will include 60 Spanish-speaking families with children
with ASD (ages 4-6), including children who are minimally verbal. The first aim is to characterize sources of
variation in the types of bilingual language environments experienced by children with ASD (e.g., different
languages from caregivers vs. therapists; different languages from different caregivers; code-switching by
bilingual caregivers; changes in language choices over time). The second aim is to examine predictors of
children’s dual-language communication and social-cognitive skills, including the role of quantity and contexts
of Spanish exposure. In a qualitative phase conducted with a subset of 30 families, the third aim is to interpret
the quantitative findings in reference to family perspectives, priorities, experiences, and challenges with
language choices and support services. The long-term goal of this work is to collaborate with families and
service providers to develop interventions that support bilingual families and promote the linguistic and social-
cognitive development of children across the autism spectrum. This career development proposal includes an
expert team of mentors from Psychology, Communication Disorders, and Public Health. The training goals
focus on conducting research with minimally verbal children with ASD, mixed methods, and using community-
based participatory research to develop and evaluate interventions. The research aims and training goals of
this career development award reflect current priorities in the strategic plan of the NIDCD for Voice, Speech,
and Language, including Improving Diagnosis, Treatment, and Prevention in Understudied Populations
(Priority Area 3) and Improving Outcomes for Human Communication through community-based research
(Priority Area 4).

 The “brain-eating amoeba” Naegleria fowleri causes a disease with a 97% fatality rate. Current
treatments are not reliable and risk significant side effects, including brain damage. Because cell proliferation is
essential for disease progression, and the microtubule network in Naegleria has evolutionarily diverged from
that in humans, targeting the mitotic spindle is a promising strategy to develop effective therapeutics with
limited side effects. However, we lack key information about the basic cell biological mechanisms that organize
the Naegleria mitotic spindle, hampering progress towards rational therapies. In particular, dynamic
microtubule turnover is critical in other cells for assembling a bipolar spindle, but it is not known to what extent
the Naegleria spindle relies on microtubule dynamics. A major obstacle is that inhibitors that block microtubule
dynamics in other species are ineffective against Naegleria’s divergent tubulins. Further, while microtubule
motor proteins play key roles in assembling spindles from diverse species, the function or even the identity of
microtubule motors within the Naegleria spindle is completely unknown. Lack of knowledge about the
mechanistic contributions of microtubule turnover and molecular motors to Naegleria spindle organization
constrains identifying key proteins and processes to target for antimicrobial development.
 This proposal will address this knowledge gap by testing the hypothesis that microtubule dynamics and
molecular motors both contribute to Naegleria spindle organization. To identify the role of microtubule
dynamics, microtubules will be stabilized with a class of inhibitors that was recently shown to block Naegleria
cell division, and the effect on the organization of the spindle will be measured with super-resolution
microscopy. Comparing untreated and drug-treated spindles at different mitotic stages will reveal which stages
require microtubule turnover. To determine the function of molecular motors in the spindle, motor genes
upregulated during cell division will be identified with RNA sequencing of mitotically synchronized Naegleria
cultures. These motors will be knocked down, and phenotypes scored by microscopy. The proposed project
will provide comprehensive training to prepare the applicant for a career as an independent investigator. With
support from a sponsor, who is a Naegleria expert, and a co-sponsor, who has decades of experience studying
cell division, the applicant will learn: new experimental techniques, such as super-resolution microscopy and
high-throughput sequencing; new conceptual approaches, including the biology of microtubules and mitosis;
and career development skills. This proposal will determine the impact of microtubule stabilization on the
Naegleria spindle and will identify the role of spindle associated molecular motors in spindle organization,
providing new targets for future treatments for the devastating disease caused by Naegleria.

Knowing how to act in response to cues in our environment is a critical behavior. Making optimal choices involves
engaging the necessary neural networks to seek rewards (e.g., food etc.), avoid negative outcomes (e.g., injury
etc.), and ignore irrelevant information. Aberrant network activity in response to cues leads to maladaptive
behavioral responses, something characteristic in many psychiatric disorders including PTSD, addiction, autism
spectrum disorder, and schizophrenia. The brainstem nucleus locus coeruleus (LC) and brain-wide levels of
norepinephrine (NE), a majority of which originates from LC, are vital for engaging appropriate behaviors in
response to cues. Recent discoveries emphasize the unexplored complexity in the organization of LC and its
role in responding to cues that elicit behavior. Distinct ensembles of LC neurons encode different cognitive
processes and behaviors. Furthermore, discrete LC subcircuits are required to parse various LC functions. My
long-term goal is to dissociate the complex role of LC and NE in regulating adaptive and maladaptive behaviors.
The specific objective of this proposed research is to identify the functional LC neural ensembles and projection
targets necessary to appropriately respond to positive and negative reinforcement cues. To achieve this goal, I
will (1) characterize LC neural activity acquired from high density electrophysiology probes and (2) identify and
modulate LC projections with an activity dependent viral labelling strategy during an active avoidance and reward
seeking task. My central hypothesis is that opposing cue-outcome associations recruit separate LC neuron
ensembles and circuits necessary for appropriate behavioral responses, even when outcome-associated
behaviors are similar. In Aim 1 I will analyze large scale electrophysiology data obtained from high-density
Neuropixel probes to characterize LC neuronal activity during active avoidance and reward cue presentation. I
hypothesize that there will be separate and distinct ensembles of neurons that respond to cues prompting similar
actions to either receive a positive outcome vs avoid a negative outcome. In Aim 2 I will use calcium-dependent
genetic tagging, Cal-Light, to identify and inhibit discrete LC projections driven by behavior-evoking cues. I
hypothesize that LC ensembles for active avoidance and reward seeking cues preferentially target different brain
regions forming functional subcircuits. Furthermore, I will test my hypothesis that activity in these LC subcircuits
is necessary for appropriate behavior. The proposed research will identify LC ensembles and projections
underlying optimal behavior, highlight circuits that may contribute to maladaptive behavior, and inform circuit-
based treatment targets for PTSD and other psychiatric disorders.

Targeting of Bioorthogonal Chemotherapeutic Nanozymes to Tumor-Associated Macrophages
 In our proposed research we will use bioorthogonal chemistry to target tumor-associated macrophages
(TAMs) in breast cancer, using bioorthogonal chemistry to turn them into ‘drug factory’ platforms for generation
of chemotherapeutics at the tumor site. We will use our ‘nanozyme’ platform to encapsulate and protect transition
metal catalysts (TMCs) within the monolayer of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). These nanozymes will be targeted
the mannose receptor strongly upregulated in TAMs. Systemic delivery of these nanozymes is anticipated to
provide effective localization to TAMs that are highly accessible in tumors. Subsequent administration of non-
toxic prodrugs will then provide uncaging of the chemotherapeutic localized to the tumor site.
 In our proposed research we will optimize the activity of our nanozyme platform. We will then engineer the
nanozymes for selective TAM uptake through ‘stealth’ zwitterionic coating and suitable targeting elements. The
targeting and therapeutic efficacy of the nanozymes will be quantified in vitro using mono- and co-culture models,
Optimized particles will then be downselected for in vivo evaluation. Our specific aims are:
Aim 1: Fabrication of Bioorthogonal Nanozymes. Goal: Engineering of monolayer structure to provide highly
 active and stable nanozymes. We will fabricate nanozymes coated with a zwitterionic layer to minimize
 non-specific uptake and mannose to target TAMs. We will optimize catalyst loading and stability in serum,
 and determine catalyst reactivity with prodrugs.
Aim 2: In Vitro Activity and Targeting Studies. Hypothesis: Targeted nanozymes will provide highly cell-selective
 activation of prodrugs. We will quantify the intracellular activity of nanozymes in cells through catalytic
 uncaging of prodyes and prodrugs. Targeting efficacy to TAMs will assessed versus unpolarized
 macrophages and other cells, and in vitro therapeutic efficacy determined using co-culture models,
 optimizing the system based on specificity, efficacy/therapeutic window, and timing.
Aim 3: Targeting of Prodrug Activation In Vivo. Hypothesis: Targeted nanozymes will localize prodrug activation
 to tumor sites, providing highly effective tumor therapy. We will use systemic injection of mannose-
 targeted nanozymes to activate profluorophores and prodrugs at tumor sites using 4T1 orthotopic breast
 carcinoma models. Quantitative tumor and intratumoral nanozyme distributions will be obtained using
 inductively-coupled mass spectrometry, and efficacy quantified by tumor size and mouse health.
 The overall goal of this project is to perform therapeutic ‘jiu-jitsu’, using TAMs that normally protect tumors
to provide launch points for highly localized therapeutic delivery to tumors. This bioorthogonal therapeutic
strategy is expected to reduce off-target effects and increase therapeutic efficacy relative to current
chemotherapeutic approaches.

 HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) causes the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). HIV/AIDS
is one of the most serious public health challenges in the world. Early diagnosis of HIV can improve health
outcome and reduce HIV transmission effectively. Currently nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) and
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) are the common methods for HIV detection. However, they can
be only performed by professionals in a central laboratory. There is an essential need for development of point-
of-care (POC) tools for early HIV detection. The p24 antigen is a protein biomarker that can be used for early
detection. However, current POC testing tools have a poor limit of detection (LOD) toward p24 detection, which
cannot be used for testing HIV within less than two weeks of post-infection
 The objective of this project is to develop a paper-based lateral flow strip (PLFS) for rapid, in-field
detection of the p24 antigen in finger-prick whole blood samples. A plasmon-enhanced fluorescent sensor will
be developed by utilizing a hierarchical three-dimensional nano-architecture. The chip-based fluorescent
sensor and a plasma-separation unit will be integrated into a single paper-based microfluidic strip to enable
blood sample pretreatment, fluid transport and analyte detection. The performance of the integrated PLFS will
be tested in terms of limit of detection, sensitivity, selectivity and applicability to clinical patient samples.
 This need-driven work capitalizes on the expertise and skills of a multidisciplinary project team in device
development, statistical modeling, medicine, HIV biology and clinical diagnosis. The discovery-driven research
is novel because of the several appealing features. That is, incorporation of a blood plasma separation unit into
the PLFS will eliminate the need of sample pretreatment in a central laboratory. The three-dimensional
plasmonic nanostructure will enhance the sensitivity of the near-infrared fluorescence sensor. The PLFS can
be read out by a commercial, battery-powered, hand-held fluorescence reader. The portable device can be
employed as a POC tool for measuring p24 antigen in finger-prick (or heel-prick) blood samples in a minimally
invasive way at home, in a clinic or other resource-limited settings. It can be used for self-testing by an
untrained lay-person, and for early infant diagnosis. The data obtained from this portable device will assist
early diagnosis of HIV within first two weeks of post-infection. Early detection of HIV infection will improve
medical intervention outcome, and reduce HIV transmission, leading to substantial reduction in HIV/AIDS-
related mortality and morbidity as well as economic costs.

Mosquito-borne pathogens, including malaria, Zika, dengue, and chikungunya continue to be a major public
health concern globally. As only older mosquitoes are infectious and represent a risk to human health, scientists
have sought to age-grade mosquitoes based on this understanding; however, no reliable, cost effective and
practical methods exist to age mosquitoes despite the tremendous epidemiological value of this approach. The
overall objective of this R01 is to establish a novel approach to age-grade mosquitoes Aedes aegypti in the field.
The approach we took is based on surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) to analyze the biomolecules
from mosquito water extract that are bound with silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) and then the SERS spectra are
used in modern machine learning models to age-grade the mosquitoes. Our central hypothesis is that AgNPs
interact with specific biomolecules enabling SERS to generate unique and predictable spectral information for
establishing modern machine learning models to determine the age of mosquitoes. Our prior work demonstrates
the feasibility of SERS and Artificial Neuron Networks (ANNs) to determine the age of both lab (error <1 day)
and field-collected (error < 2 days) mosquitoes Ae. aegypti. In the proposed work, we will establish robust lab
and field-deployable protocols to produce reliable and repeatable SERS data of mosquito water extract. Then,
we will manipulate the lab and field conditions to determine the impact of biotic (food and infection status) and
abiotic (temperature) to SERS characteristics. Robust and accurate machine learning model based on modern
ANNs and Domain Adoption (DA) strategies will be established and validated for age-grading mosquitoes in the
field. In addition, we will explore the Multi-task Learning (MTL) strategies to simultaneously determine the age
and infection status. Our long-term goal is to establish a rapid, cost-effective, and field-deployable system that
enables real-time analysis and data sharing to facilitate epidemiological studies, risk assessment, vector control
intervention monitoring and evaluation.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：The Kritzer lab focuses on inhibiting protein-protein interactions involved in autophagy. Autophagy is a protein
degradation pathway that is active in all human cells, and inhibiting autophagy shows promise as a therapy for
late-stage cancers especially in combination with DNA-damaging chemotherapies. Autophagy research and
drug development currently rely on compounds that inhibit autophagy indirectly. Better, more specific inhibitors
of autophagy would be broadly adopted. A large amount of genetics and cell biology work supports that
inhibiting the LC3/GABARAP family of proteins can block autophagy selectively. In one series of projects, we
will develop novel stapled peptide and small molecule inhibitors of LC3/GABARAP and evaluate them in
models of late-stage cancers and other diseases.
Because of our expertise in compounds that bind LC3/GABARAP proteins, we also propose to evaluate related
compounds as autophagy-targeting chimeras (AUTACs). These compounds could be used to selectively
degrade any proteins in the cell, similar to proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) but potentially more
versatile and easier to develop. Based on strong preliminary data that validate the AUTAC concept, we will
develop novel AUTACs and demonstrate their ability to degrade endogenous proteins, unlocking a
broad new area for drug development in targeted protein degradation.
Over the course of developing stapled peptides as autophagy modulators, the Kritzer lab encountered a
common problem in the field: how to measure the amount that actually reaches the cytosol. In an
independent series of projects, the Kritzer lab has developed novel assays that quantitate the cytosolic
penetration of large-molecule therapeutics. In this proposal, we describe new opportunities to address
challenging problems in drug development for large-molecule therapeutics. We describe new methods to
measure penetration to different cellular compartments in any cell type, including primary cells. We also
describe a molecular evolution approach to develop a new “turn-on” assay that measures the real-time
kinetics of cytosolic penetration. We describe pooled CRISPR screens to reveal the cellular components
that mediate endosomal escape. Finally, we describe a novel screening platform that will allow us to screen
thousands to millions of molecules at a time for those that are most cell-penetrant; the new screen will be
incorporated into a design-test-learn cycle to produce data-driven design algorithms for cytosol-penetrant
molecules. All together, these data will represent a huge leap in our understanding of structure-penetration
relationships for several classes of large-molecule therapeutics.

 Almost half of the human genome is composed of repetitive DNA elements, and about three percent of
the genome is composed of microsatellites, short tandem repeats of 1-6 DNA bases. Many repeat sequences
can form alternative DNA structures that interfere with replication and repair. This can lead to disease-causing
repeat expansions, such as the CAG/CTG expansions that cause Huntington’s disease, myotonic dystrophy,
and many spinocerebellar ataxias. Breaks within structure-forming repeats cause chromosome deletions and
rearrangements, which are common in cancer cells undergoing replication stress. The goal of my laboratory is
to study mechanisms of genome instability caused by structure-forming repeats, and to elucidate cellular
pathways that have evolved to prevent these deleterious mutations. We recently discovered that long tracts of
structure-forming CAG repeats relocate to the nuclear periphery to facilitate replication through the tract and
prevent chromosome breakage and repeat expansions. This pathway depends on modification of proteins at
the replication fork by sumoylation, and subsequent interaction of the sumoylated proteins with components of
the nuclear pore complex (NPC) in late S phase, followed by release back into the nuclear interior in G2 phase.
Recent data shows that this pathway is relevant for several types of replication barriers, including protein
blocks and other structure-forming repeats. Therefore, it is vital to better understand the purpose of this
relocation to the NPC and its role in facilitating replication and preventing genome instability, which is our long-
term goal.
 We have developed a system to follow the location of an expanded CAG tract or other structure-
forming repeats in the cell nucleus using microscopy, complemented by biochemical techniques to detect
proteins interacting with the repeat locus. We will use the budding yeast (S. cerevisiae) system which allows us
to combine these approaches with the powerful genetics of the yeast system. Yeast replication and repair
pathways retain a high level of conservation with human cells, but the smaller size of the yeast genome and
proteome and wild-type (non-transformed) state of cells are advantages that will allow us to make significant
progress on our goals. We plan to elucidate the purpose of relocation of stalled replication forks to the nuclear
pore complex and the mechanisms that occur there to allow restart of replication forks, using both established
and novel approaches. We will also determine how nuclear pore-linked fork restart prevents chromosome
breaks and repeat instability and determine how repeat expansions occur during fork recovery. Our aim is to
understand NPC-dependent modification of replisome-associated proteins and fork remodeling that occurs at
replication barriers, and in so doing understand vital cellular processes that maintain genome stability. This is
important because understanding how mutations arise is critical to developing strategies to prevent their
occurrence.

Osteoarthritis (OA) is a highly prevalent and debilitating disease that currently has no effective therapy. OA has
many risk factors, such as joint injury and aging. However, many people with these risk factors do not develop
OA or develop it to a lesser extent. Individual responses to the same treatment are often also highly variable,
hampering the testing of therapy in a reasonable-sized population. Thus, there is an urgent need to understand
the basis for the diverse manifestations of OA. One driving factor of OA is proposed to be local inflammation.
As prolonged inflammation elicits catabolic changes in the joint, the ability of each individual to resist
inflammation could be directly linked to the trajectory of disease progression. Identifying factors that provide
the competence to resist inflammation may be key to elucidating the cause of OA progression in individuals.
Our long-term goal is to investigate OA pathogenesis to improve its treatment. The goal of this grant is to
investigate the competence to resist inflammation and joint destruction conferred by an underexplored
molecule (Wnt7a) from the Wnt signaling family. This proposal is based on our study that showed a striking
negative-exponential relationship between Wnt7a and catabolic genes in individual human cartilage
specimens. When Wnt7a expression was below a certain threshold, the samples were almost always of OA
background, as if low levels of Wnt7a signify a higher risk of OA. In this way, Wnt7a may be a key factor
associated with OA variability. Ectopic expression of Wnt7a under normal conditions did not impact cartilage
matrix levels, but strongly halted joint destruction in experimental OA, suggesting that Wnt7a provided the joint
with a certain ability to resist OA. Thus, we hypothesize that the level of Wnt7a within articular cartilage
determines the competence against inflammation and impacts the trajectory of OA in each individual,
forming the basis for OA variability. This hypothesis will be tested in two Specific Aims by 1) investigating
whether Wnt7a alters the course of inflammation and the trajectory of cartilage loss and joint destruction in OA
and 2) identifying downstream pathways and upstream regulators of Wnt7a. We will use gain- and loss-of
function approaches on mouse OA and human cartilage specimens. The novelty of this study lies in the
concept of Wnt7a as a competence factor for OA resistance in individuals to explore the mechanism of
heterogeneity in OA, and in the use of advanced imaging technologies to test these concepts. These studies
will define the role of Wnt7a in curtailing prolonged inflammation and the propensity for degenerative changes
in OA. Furthermore, it will identify fundamental mechanisms for enhancing or preserving endogenous Wnt7a
function in cartilage for joint protection. Thus, this work will provide important mechanistic insights into OA
progression and its variability and the design of strategies to treat this disease.

 Neutrophils (PMNs, polymorphonuclear cells) are pivotal innate immune cells that directly mediate
pathogen clearance through release of reactive oxygen species (ROS), degranulation, neutrophilic
extracellular traps (NETs) and phagocytosis. The bacterial pathogen, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis (Yptb)
antagonizes these antimicrobial actions by injecting critical virulence proteins, called Yops, into PMNs. We
seek to understand mechanisms that mediate clearance of bacterial pathogens in tissue infection by
understanding the processes that are disrupted by YopH and YopO. We have shown that SKAP2 is one
essential target of YopH in PMNs in tissue infection; however, SKAP2 is not the only essential target of YopH
in tissue infection. Missense mutations in SKAP2 are associated with the development of autoimmune
disorders and cancers. This suggests that PMN dysfunction downstream of SKAP2 signaling has wide ranging
implications beyond infection control. We have further shown that SKAP2-dependent mechanisms in
neutrophils are critical for limiting growth of another Gram-negative pathogen, Klebsiella pneumoniae (Kp), in
lungs. Using PMNs derived from myeloid progenitor (MP) hematopoietic stem cells, we found that SKAP2 is
essential for extracellular (ROS) production but is not required for degranulation after Kp infection. Surprisingly,
SKAP2 is required for Syk phosphorylation after infection by Kp, but not for Syk phosphorylation after
stimulation of CLRs and integrin receptors, indicating that neutrophil recognition of Kp is via a distinct receptor,
possibly a G protein coupled receptor (GPCR). The objective of this application is to use our expertise in
murine infection models, MP-PMN genetic manipulation, bacterial genetics and live-cell visualization of protein
complexes, to understand pathways in PMNs that are targeted by YopH and YopO. We will further investigate
whether these targets play crucial roles in the control Kp. To this end, our specific aims are to (1) Dissect the
modular functions of SKAP2 required for generating anti-microbial responses in neutrophils after infection with
Kp. (2) Understand the effects of YopO on GPCR signaling in PMNs during murine infection. (3) Identify the
SKAP2-independent pathways that are targeted by YopH to inactivate neutrophil degranulation. After
completion of these studies, we will understand how SKAP2 and other Yop-targeted proteins work in PMNs to
control infection by Kp and Yptb. A thorough understanding of molecular mechanisms that signal for the
release of the tissue damaging bactericidal factors, ROS and granules, by PMNs during infection should lead
to novel and targeted approaches to manipulate these pathways to enhance these activities during infection
with multidrug resistant bacteria and to stop excessive damage due to uncontrolled PMN responses in a
variety of auto-immune diseases.

Macrophages are key effector cells of the immune system, with critical functions in killing of microbes,
production of inflammatory regulators, and tissue repair. However, an excessive macrophage response
contributes to the pathology of cancer as well as inflammatory and degenerative diseases. In addition,
unchecked proliferation of macrophage precursors in lieu of differentiation leads to acute myeloid leukemia. To
better address how to modulate macrophage function to help abate diseases that involve changes in
macrophage biology, we must understand the critical molecular pathways that govern macrophage
differentiation and regulate their activity.
We propose that one of these pathways will involve mRNA polyadenylation, an essential maturation step in
which mRNA precursor is trimmed at its 3' end and a poly(A) tail (pA) added. Changing the position of the pA
site through a process called alternative polyadenylation (APA) plays an important, increasingly appreciated
role in regulation of gene expression. Shortening of the 3' untranslated region can remove regulatory
sequences that control RNA stability, translation, and subcellular localization, whereas coding region
shortening can dramatically alter protein function. While global changes in APA have been observed in tumor
progression and other types of cellular differentiation, the contribution of APA to macrophage differentiation
has not been studied.
We hypothesize that a global shift in APA is required for macrophage differentiation and that this shift is
driven by changing levels of APA regulators. Our objective is to determine how APA contributes to
macrophage differentiation, with the long-range goal of defining how this might be manipulated in therapeutic
settings to promote differentiation and modulate macrophage function. Our specific aims will 1) determine the
global pattern of APA during macrophage differentiation, the functional classes of genes impacted by APA,
and sequence features that might characterize these sites, 2) define drivers of macrophage APA and the
consequence that altering their expression has on differentiation as well as well-characterized macrophage
functions such as cytokine production, migration, and phagocytosis, and 3) determine the molecular
mechanisms that alter the levels of the proteins that regulate APA. Because macrophage are a first line of
defense for many diseases and dysregulation of their differentiation leads to leukemias, our proposed studies
should ultimately inform new therapeutic tools to modulate macrophage production. They will also broadly
advance our understanding of general and tissue-specific APA paradigms. s

Tuberculosis (TB) requires the simultaneous administration of multiple antibiotics to eradicate heterogeneous bacterial populations. Treatment duration ranges from 6 months for drug susceptible TB to 24 months and longer for extensively resistant TB. With a number of recent drug approvals and promising clinical development candidates, there is hope for much needed treatment shortening. However, we need high-throughput methods to rank the very large number of possible drug combinations and reduce them to a feasible number for testing in clinical trials. Currently, drug regimens are prioritized based on efficacy in the mouse model, which despite its ease of use, is available for only a small subset of all possible combinations. In addition, differentially drug-susceptible bacterial subpopulations that are found in human pulmonary lesions are not well recapitulated in murine lungs. A hallmark of TB is the formation of lesions and the coincident remarkable ability of Mycobacterium tuberculosis to persist in a variety of lesion types during drug treatment. These hard-to-treat bacterial subpopulations cause disease relapse. Therefore, key to prioritizing new regimens is systematic, high-quality in vitro measurement of multidrug regimen potencies and a framework that links in vitro measurements to efficacy in different types of human-like lesions. To do so requires that we develop in vitro models that capture key lesion-specific stressors and harness the potential of combination therapies to identify drugs that act synergistically. We propose to bridge this gap by developing a data-driven pipeline to rapidly prioritize drug regimens by combining in vitro and in vivo measurements of drug action with mathematical modeling. (1) We will utilize efficient measurement of drug combinations in a variety of growth conditions for direct comparison of combination drug effects in lesions. (2) We will leverage the human-like properties of pathology in non-human primates to query drug efficacy in distinct lesion compartments. (3) We will apply the power of multiscale (molecular, cellular, granuloma and organ scales) mathematical modeling to identify the stressors that are most predictive of in vivo efficacy. To build the pipeline, we will leverage a new drug regimen that has performed surprisingly well in clinical trials but the components of which antagonize in standard potency assays in vitro: the NiX-TB regimen comprising bedaquiline-pretomanid-linezolid. Once validated for NiX-TB versus standard of care, the pipeline will be used to rationally optimize and re-invent the NiX regimen using data-driven computational simulation.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Many pathogens grow within host cells by building membrane-bound replication compartments essential for
growth. The compartments provide important protection from host innate immune cytoplasmic surveillance
systems and interfere with trafficking organisms into degradative compartments. Growth in the compartment
is driven by microbial proteins which promote compartment construction, protection against innate immune
surveillance and provide regulatory control over the host cell. How these different arms of the pathogen are
coordinated is poorly understood. A bacterium that uses this strategy is Legionella pneumophila, which
grows in a vacuole within macrophages during pneumonic disease. A group of over 300 Legionella proteins
are translocated into host cells, controlling all aspects of the intracellular lifestyle, including formation of the
replication compartment, blocking host cell translation, and preventing cytosolic recognition of the
replication compartment. The organism hijacks host tubular endoplasmic reticulum (ER) as one of the
earliest steps in replication compartment formation, an event promote by the bacterial Sde proteins.
The proposed studies will test two models for Sde function. First, it will test the model that the Sde proteins
controls ER tubule formation, replication compartment formation, and immune avoidance by promoting a
three-step pathway. Secondly, it will test the model that manipulation of host translation initiation plays a
role in coordinating replication vacuole construction and immune avoidance. The first model proposes that
the Sde deubiquitinase activity liberates free ubiquitin (Ub) from the polyUb on the replication compartment.
This would serve as a pool for ADPribosyltransferase and phosphodiesterase domains to promote Ub
modification of the tubular ER protein Rtn4 and host translation initiation factors (eIFs). In the final step, the
protein family masks the replication compartment with a phosphoribose to prevent recognition by the host
autophagy pathway. The model will be tested by manipulating polyUb pools in the cell, performing electron
microscopy on mutants deranged in this pathway, and reconstructing tubular ER rearrangements in a cell-
free system. To determine the role that targeting of eIF proteins plays in these processes, the targets will be
verified using purified components and the regulated initiation step will be identified. In addition, it will be
determined if eIF proteins are inactivated to remove ribosomes from rough ER and allow close docking of
ER sheets to the replication compartment, and if eIF manipulation skews the host translational response to
favor bacterial replication. Extensive preliminary studies support the proposed experiments, providing a
solid underpinning for this work. Throughout these studies, the objective is to identify a weak link in the
microbial strategy of manipulating ER tubules to promote intracellular growth, with an eye toward
developing antimicrobials that target this process.

The human pathogen Vibrio cholerae, the causative agent of the disease cholera, regulates
virulence factor production, biofilm formation, competence, and other important processes
through quorum sensing (QS), a cell-cell communication mechanism that relies on the production,
detection, and response to chemical signal molecules called autoinducers. QS allows bacteria to
coordinate population-wide gene expression and function as coordinated groups. We have
identified four QS signaling pathways that integrate into the central QS circuit of V. cholerae.
Importantly, we found that disruption of these four sensory pathways altogether renders V.
cholerae unable to colonize animal hosts. Our data also suggest that ethanolamine and cyclic
AMP (cAMP), respectively, are responsible for controlling two of these receptors, CqsR and VpsS.
In Aim 1, we will determine how ethanolamine and other related molecules regulate CqsR. In Aim
2, we will determine how cAMP regulates VpsS. In Aim 3, we will define the regulatory hierarchy
in the V. cholerae QS circuit. Specifically, we will determine the roles of a recently discovered
cyclic dinucleotide called cyclic GMP-AMP in QS gene regulation. Together, our work will not only
define the role of QS in V. cholerae pathogenesis, it will also illustrate how integration of multiple
signals results in a coherent response in a bacterial cell-cell communication process. It is now
well established that QS is employed by many bacterial species to regulate both harmful and
beneficial traits. A long standing goal in the field is to develop pro-QS and/or anti-QS molecules
to manipulate bacterial group behaviors. Our hope is to harness the knowledge on QS to enable
the design of interference strategies that can be translated into new therapies to combat infectious
diseases.

Calorie restriction (CR) is a promising nutritional strategy with the potential to slow the aging process. The
Comprehensive Assessment of Long-term Effects of Reducing Intake of Energy (CALERIE) trial, funded by the
National Institute on Aging, was the first clinical trial to demonstrate the feasibility of achieving sustained,
moderate CR in healthy, young and middle-aged adults without obesity. During the 2-year CR intervention,
participants achieved 12% CR on average and, compared to an ad libitum intake control group, experienced
remarkable improvements in markers of healthspan and a slower rate of biological aging. The overarching goal
of this proposed study is to examine whether 2 years of CR results in long-term improvements in the biological,
phenotypic, and functional hallmarks of human aging. We hypothesize that exposure to a 2-year CR
intervention in early to mid-adulthood results in sustained lower rates of biological aging, delayed
manifestations of phenotypic aging, superior indices of functional aging, and greater quality of life compared to
ad libitum intake. To test this hypothesis, we will conduct an observational follow-up study of CALERIE
participants 10 to 15 years after the end of their trial participation. Participants from the CALERIE CR group will
be compared with an ad libitum intake comparison group composed of the CALERIE ad libitum control group
and a matched community-dwelling cohort from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA). The well-
characterized BLSA cohort is included as a comparison sample to address the concern that the highly
screened CALERIE controls may have been healthier than the general population and highly motivated for
behavior change. The BLSA also has the rigor, quality control, and several of the same outcome
measurements as the CALERIE trial to facilitate comparisons. The proposed CALERIE follow-up study will
include a comprehensive set of physical and functional assessments, including resting metabolic rate, body
composition, cardiorespiratory fitness, grip strength, and cognitive function, in addition to psychological and
quality-of-life measures. Blood and urine also will be collected and analyzed for markers of biological aging and
cardiometabolic disease risk. Comparisons will be made between CALERIE CR participants and the combined
ad libitum intake comparison group (the CALERIE ad libitum control group and the BLSA cohort). Evaluating
legacy effects of the CALERIE trial will determine the effectiveness of a CR intervention in early to mid-
adulthood for preventing the development or delaying the progression of age-related chronic disease. The
proposed trial will augment the CALERIE data and biospecimen repository for future research to advance our
understanding of human aging.

Skeletal muscle loss and impairment – prominent features of the aging process – lead to physical disability.
There is plausible evidence that altering components of the diet, mainly protein intake and acid/base balance,
may improve indices of muscle health in older adults and thus translate to a reduction in physical disability. A
growing number of studies suggest that increasing protein intake using a whey protein supplement may benefit
muscle health in older adults. However, a main concern is that high protein results in a large dietary acid load
from the breakdown of protein to acidogenic byproducts, which could in turn promote muscle degradation
particularly in older adults with age-related declines in renal excretion of acid. Thus, our hypothesis is that the
balance between the amount of protein in the diet (anabolic component) and the net acid load of the diet
(catabolic component) in part determines whether the diet as a whole has a net anabolic or catabolic effect on
muscle. Preliminary data from our group have suggested that a daily potassium bicarbonate (KHCO3)
supplement improved lower extremity muscle power in postmenopausal women. Based on our preliminary data,
we plan to conduct a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2x2 factorial study in which sedentary men
and women age 65 and older on baseline lower protein diets will be enrolled. Participants will assigned to one
of four groups: either a whey protein supplement (to raise protein intake to 1.5 g/kg/d) with or without KHCO3
81 mmol/d or an isocaloric placebo supplement with or without KHCO3 81 mmol/d for 24 wks. The primary
outcome is lower extremity muscle power. Secondary outcomes are lower extremity muscle endurance,
physical performance, lean mass, and 24-hr urinary nitrogen excretion. Twenty-four-week changes in these
outcomes will be compared in the 4 groups. Our central hypothesis is that higher protein intake plus a
neutralizing alkaline salt will have additive effects on muscle performance and mass in older adults to either
intervention alone. If successful, this research could result in a paradigm shift in dietary advice to older adults
to reduce physical disability. As 1 in 5 US adults will be over age 65 by year 2040, a safe dietary intervention
that reduces age-related musculoskeletal decline will be an important preventative health step for our aging
society.

Osteosarcoma (OS), the most common malignant bone tumor in humans and dogs, shares several features in
both species including clinical presentation and molecular alterations. Despite numerous efforts there have been
no improvements in disease outcome for either species in the past three decades: 30% of people and 90% of
dogs still die of metastasis. While some approaches have shown promise in the setting of microscopic disease,
in both species, macroscopic metastasis exhibits inherent resistance to multiple agents (kinase inhibitors,
chemotherapy, immunotherapy, among others). I recently characterized the canine OS genome and found that
as with human OS, the somatic mutational load is low, copy number aberrations/structural variants predominate,
and no clear molecular drivers are evident. These data, along with a history of failed clinical trial efforts suggest
that contemporary approaches to therapeutic advancement such as kinase inhibitors and immune checkpoint
blockade will likely have limited clinical impact, necessitating the development of innovative therapeutic
strategies. A distinguishing feature of cancer cells is their ability to undergo aerobic glycolysis, allowing them to
thrive in a variety of microenvironments. Monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs) are key facilitators of this, moving
lactic acid across the plasma membrane, and are critical for growth and metastasis of glycolytic tumors, such as
OS. In previous work, I found that loss of MCT1 or MCT4 function in OS cells decreases basal and compensatory
glycolysis, cellular proliferation and invasive capacity. I also showed that MCT4 is a direct transcriptional target
of STAT3 and FOXM1, both of which exhibit constitutive activation in OS, supporting a link between
MCT4/STAT3/FOXM1 and aerobic glycolysis. Building on these data, I will by leverage a comparative cross-
species approach to first define regulatory circuits that support aerobic glycolysis mediated by MCT1/MCT4 in
OS and then identify and validate therapeutic vulnerabilities related to MCT control of cellular metabolism. I
hypothesize that in OS cells, sustained MCT1/MCT4 expression is driven by constitutive STAT3/FOXM1
activation and increased MYC copy number, thereby promoting aerobic glycolysis. I further predict that
loss of MCT1/MCT4 through genetic manipulation or targeted inhibitors will impair tumor growth in vivo,
and that this can be maximized through rational drug combination. To accomplish this, I will first
characterize the transcriptional regulation of MCT1/MCT4 in OS using a combination of ChIP-sequencing,
bisulfite sequencing and 4C/ChiA-PET analysis. Xenograft studies in mice will complement in vitro analyses to
assess how loss of MCT1/4 function affects OS metabolic profile, tumor phenotype and tumor growth. Lastly, I
will use a zebrafish model to screen select agents for synthetic lethality with MCT blockade, then validate findings
in mice. The rich research environment afforded by Tufts University and its partners ensures access to resources
and expertise necessary for completion of the proposed work. My training in veterinary oncology, clinical trials
and genetics along with guidance from my mentoring team with expertise in genomics, bioinformatics, animal
models and translational oncology make me well positioned for successful transition to independence.

 Decision-making is critical for survival but is a complex process to understand at the level of brain function.
Animals and humans alike can use two strategies to solve problems of decision-making: goal-directed or habitual
behavior. Habits emerge late in training as animals transition from reliance on a goal-directed strategy to a habit
with experience. Biologically, habits are known to develop via communication between a network of areas that
span across the brain. Of particular interest for habit formation are the prefrontal cortex (IL), the sensorimotor
striatum (DLS), dopaminergic projections to the striatum (SNc), and the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA).
Previous work has shown that a characteristic neuronal signature develops in IL and DLS, where as a habit
develops, single-unit neuronal activity accentuates the beginning and end of actions of the behavior as it
becomes well-learned. Importantly, as habits are comprised of multiple components (e.g. efficiency of action
sequences and insensitivity to goal value), these individual features correlate with neural activity in distinct brain
areas across the habit network (IL: outcome devaluation insensitivity, DLS: action vigor). However, there is a
gap in knowledge in how activity in the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) codes habits or how that activity
relates to the function of these other interconnected areas
 The objective of this project is to define how neural activity in CeA contributes to habit formation and
whether a distinct component of behavior correlates with neural activity. The rationale is that the habit network
is conserved across mammals as habits are ubiquitous and the potential for basic research to translate into
bettering the human condition is high. The central hypothesis is that CeA neurons will develop a “chunking”
pattern of activity that is necessary for a habit to develop, with behavioral correlates of this neural activity similar
to those that correlate with IL. Guided by methods and data from Specific Aim 1, where behavioral phenotypes
of habit and methodology to test habit formation are addressed, Specific Aim 2 will, through in-vivo
electrophysiology, determine if CeA activity brackets in a manner similar to IL, DLS, and SNc as a habit forms
on an elevated plus-maze task. Specific Aim 3 details a plan to identify and pursue a postdoctoral research
fellowship upon completion of the dissertation work described in Specific Aim 2. Overall, the proposed
experiment has the potential to provide mental health clinicians and researchers significant insight into how
compulsive actions may arise from improperly timed amygdalar activity and will further define how neural activity
can contribute to psychological phenomena such as habit formation.

The overarching objective of this proposal is to investigate a novel mechanism for sudden unexpected death in
epilepsy (SUDEP). Our laboratory recently made the unexpected discovery that mice genetically engineered for
hyperactive stress circuits exhibit an increased incidence of SUDEP, a finding that was verified to be
translationally relevant from observed neuroendocrine abnormalities in patients that died of confirmed or
suspected SUDEP. Given that both stress and SUDEP link to disruption of central circuits responsible for the
regulation of cardiorespiratory function, we propose that exaggerated activity of central stress circuits on
downstream brainstem autonomic control centers represents a novel mechanism contributing to increased
SUDEP risk. Corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus
(PVN) are at the apex of the stress axis and project directly to brainstem regions critical for autonomic regulation,
including the nucleus of the solitary tract (PVN-NTSCRH). PVN-NTSCRH has a well-established role in integrating
cardiorespiratory responses to stress, making them a likely driver of cardiorespiratory dysfunction related to
central stress axis hyperexcitability and, potentially, SUDEP. In fact, our preliminary data demonstrate that
chemogenetic activation of PVN-NTSCRH increases SUDEP incidence. The current application will build on the
expertise of, Drs. Jamie Maguire and Carie Boychuk, to test the hypothesis that HPA axis hyperexcitability in
chronically epileptic mice increases the risk for SUDEP through increased PVN-NTSCRH drive, exaggerating
cardiac vagal output during homeostatic challenges. We will investigate this hypothesis by examining whether
there is increased PVN-NTSCRH drive associated with SUDEP risk and whether excessive activation of this
pathway is sufficient to increase SUDEP incidence. We will interrogate potential, novel pathophysiological
mechanisms mediating the impact of hyperactive stress circuits on SUDEP risk by examining the impact on
cardiac vagal output. Finally, we will investigate whether environmental factors associated with hyperactive
stress circuits, such as chronic stress, can impact cardiac vagal function and SUDEP risk. This application has
the potential to uncover a novel mechanism contributing to SUDEP risk, which may also be relevant to other
forms of sudden death.

at Tufts University’s Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences (GSBS), BDBS has trained 220 students in the
past 15 years, all of whom have either completed or are still enrolled in undergraduate training. Among those
who have completed college, 129 have entered health-science-related graduate programs. Another 74 have

mentored summer lab experience focused on NHLBI research. A merger of Tufts Medical School with its major
clinical affiliate permits us to increase the number of preceptors – especially those in NHLBI research (from 40
to 52), and we provide them with culturally-aware mentor training. These preceptors are clustered into seven
areas of focus, such that trainees can further learn the value of interdisciplinary collaboration in small groups.
Their lab experience is complemented by Skills Workshops for training in scientific skills that enhance self-
confidence and identity as a scientist. Lunch with a Professor and Meet the Scientist introduce trainees to the
breadth of biomedical science careers and provide career models through interactions with faculty (beyond
their own preceptor), GSBS alumni who are biomedical leaders, BDBS alumni, graduate students, post-
baccalaureate, and postdoctoral scholars. BDBS trainees are housed together close to labs and public
transportation at the Tufts University Medical School residence, building their cohort community, while social
events that include GSBS students, faculty and alumni provide a diverse and welcoming community (25% of
our PhD students are from URG compared to 11% in 2018). A novel aspect of our social events are our
STEAM-based activities (STEM+Art to inspire our trainees to creative thinking), taking advantage of the Tufts
School of the Museum of Fine Arts and an outreach program for near-peer mentoring. By achieving our aims,
BDBS gives trainees the skills and confidence needed to persist and compete effectively for advanced training
positions, and eventually to assume leadership roles in the biomedical workforce. Our record demonstrates
that BDBS is making a strong contribution toward diversifying the biomedical workforce, and we anticipate that
our new approaches will build on this strong foundation to continue enhancing diversity in the biomedicine.

metabolites that influence human health. Characterizing these metabolites and their relationships with major
disease endpoints is critical to elucidate new pathways of risk and corresponding novel preventive and
pharmacologic treatments. Phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan are the three aromatic amino acids (AAA),
centrally involved in protein synthesis and metabolized to a range of bioactive compounds. Gut microbial
enzymes ferment AAA into a plethora of small molecules via deamination, oxidation, and/or reduction. The gut
microbe-derived metabolites can be further metabolized by host liver enzymes before they reach systemic
circulation. Several AAA-derived microbial metabolites have been previously identified as of potential interest
in human health, such as indole-3-propionic acid (I3PA), derived from microbial metabolism of tryptophan and
implicated in diet induced obesity, advanced atherosclerosis, gut permeability, and brain health. However, the
health effects of this and other AAA-derived microbial metabolites remain understudied.
This project resubmission will leverage the power of serial biomarkers measures to investigate the
interrelationships of novel microbiome-generated AAA metabolites with initiation, extent, and clinical onset of
subclinical CVD, clinical CHD, and total mortality. Primary aims include: (1) To investigate the independent
relationships of serial measures of plasma aromatic amino acid (AAA)-derived microbial metabolites with
longitudinal onset and progression of subclinical CVD. (2) To investigate the independent relationships of serial
measures of plasma AAA-derived microbial metabolites with incident CVD events. (3) To investigate the
independent relationships of serial measures of plasma AAA-derived microbial metabolites with total mortality.
Secondary Aims include focuses to investigate (a) the independent dietary, lifestyle, and demographic
predictors of plasma AAA-derived microbial metabolites and change in these metabolites over time in two
diverse community-based populations; and (b) potential effect modification of metabolite-outcome associations
by age, sex, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, background diet, lipid-lowering medication use, renal
function, and prevalent CVD.
This project will provide novel, impactful evidence on how AAA-derived microbial metabolites, measured
serially over time, relate to subclinical CVD, clinical CVD, and mortality in the Multi-Ethnic Study of
Atherosclerosis (MESA; 6,800 middle-aged white, Black, Hispanic, and Chinese adults) and the
Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS; 5,148 older white and Black adults). In pilot work, we have evaluated the
long-term reproducibility of these AAA analytes using serial blood samples collected at baseline (year 2) and 9
years later (year 11) in a random subset of 100 CHS participants.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Project Abstract. Defects in ER protein homeostasis (proteostasis) perturb the ER proteome and lead to the
accumulation of misfolded proteins which is detrimental to the cell. This is underscored by the fact that numerous
human diseases from cystic fibrosis to neurodegeneration are caused by defects in ER proteostasis. Historically,
the field has focused on how ER protein misfolding is sensed and rectified resulting in the detailed
characterization of the unfolded protein response (UPR) and ER-associated degradation (ERAD); pathways that
aim to mitigate protein misfolding. However, whether processes exist that prevent ER protein misfolding in the
first place were largely unknown. Recent studies indicate the presence of a surveillance system that acts during
protein synthesis to tune ER protein translation based on the status of the ER proteome. This process, termed
pre-emptive ER quality control relies on local regulation of translation at the ribosome to modulate the biogenesis
of ER proteins and ubiquitin dependent degradation of misfolded proteins prior to ER insertion. Therefore, pre-
emptive ER quality control oversees translation to prevent folding defects. Because this system is powerful way
to maintain a pristine ER proteome without eliciting the UPR or ERAD, mechanisms that activate this process
may be pursued to advance therapies for a variety of diseases caused by protein misfolding. However, we do
not know the identity of the molecules or mechanisms regulating pre-emptive ER quality control. This level of
understanding is critical to develop a framework understanding how ER proteostasis defects cause disease.
 In ongoing studies in my lab, we have found that UBXN1 is a new modulator of pre-emptive ER quality
control. UBXN1 is best studied as an adaptor to the p97 ATPase, a critical player in ERAD and a major research
focus of my group. In cells lacking UBXN1 we find a significant upregulation of many ER proteins and robust
activation of the unfolded protein response. Our studies suggest that UBXN1 represses translation. Surprisingly,
UBXN1 does not function in ERAD and its role in translation is independent of p97. The objective of this proposal
is to characterize this new role of UBXN1 as a pre-emptive ER quality control factor. We will test the central
hypothesis that UBXN1 interacts with unique ribosomal proteins in a ubiquitin-dependent manner to regulate the
specific translation of ER proteins. We will further investigate the pathway through which translation impacts
UPR activation. In Aim 1 we will identify the mechanisms by which UBXN1 regulates translation, in Aim 2 we will
delineate the pathway through which UBXN1 represses the UPR, and in Aim 3 we determine whether UBXN1
enables selective translation of ER proteins. The proposed work is conceptually innovative as we do not fully
understand how preemptive ER quality control is regulated. This work is of significance because we will define
how UBXN1 maintains ER proteostasis by modulating translation. Successful completion of these studies will
position UBXN1 as an important regulator of protein translation and provide molecular-level insight into how
modulating translation can maintain ER proteostasis and protect against disease.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Schistosomes are parasitic flatworms that cause a chronic, debilitating disease afflicting
>200 million people in >70 countries. The parasites live for years in what should be a very
hostile environment – the blood of vertebrates – yet they appear to elicit little if any
damaging responses from the host’s hemostatic systems. We hypothesize that proteins at
the host-interactive surface, identified in the previous funding cycle, are central to this
ability. In this competing renewal, we propose to test several key hypotheses concerning:
1) the hemostatic roles of tegumental ectoenzymes SmNPP5 & SmATPDase in vitro and
in vivo, 2) the ability of tegumental ectoenzymes SmAP & NACE to generate key nutrients
- adenosine and nicotinamide respectively - that are vital for schistosome survival and
growth and 3) the ability of tegumental calpain to impede coagulation, promote
thrombolysis and to block local thrombus formation in vivo. These studies aim to reveal the
physiological functions of these proteins and will yield significant new information on the
molecular mechanisms used by schistosomes to blunt both arms of the host thrombotic
response (platelet function and the coagulation cascade) while maintaining access to vital
nutrients. In addition, the work may identify tegumental proteins critical for parasite survival
leading to subsequent screens to discover potential schistosome-killing drugs that inhibit
these molecules and/or to trials testing their vaccine potential. In this way, our planned
experiments have the potential to reveal novel and valid targets, as well as new
treatments, for intervention in a parasite that remains a widespread and major cause of
human disease. Additionally, given wide interest in understanding the mechanisms
governing coagulation control, knowing how schistosomes regulate this process will be of
interest beyond the field of eukaryotic pathogen research.

Microfold (M) cells are specialized cells of the intestinal epithelium that are concentrated in the epithelium lying
over the lymph follicles, called the follicle associated epithelium (FAE). M cells are designed to deliver antigens
to underlying lymph tissues. Their specialized function is facilitated both by a host of receptors on their apical
surface that bind to antigens and particles and their ability to rapidly transcytose these bound antigens from the
apical surface to the basolateral surface where they are captured by immune cells within the Peyer’s patches.
M cells are also exploited as cellular portals by many enteric bacterial and viral pathogens to gain access to
the lymph system, including the bacterial pathogen Yersinia pseudotuberculosis (Yptb). In our previous work,
we established a differentiated human ileum organoid model system on Transwells and induced M cell
development in order to study molecular mechanistic interactions between Yptb and M cells. We found that
Yptb that are not expressing the type III secretion system (T3SS) are internalized by M cells and found in the
basolateral chamber in high numbers. By contrast, Yptb that are expressing the T3SS remained bound on the
extracellular surface of M cells and induced M cell extrusion from the monolayer. Strikingly, YopE, a T3SS
effector protein, caused extrusion of M cell from the monolayer. Thus, we hypothesize that oral infection of
mice with Yptb leads to transient M cell depletion due to the YopE RhoA-GAP activity and this M cell depletion
limits superinfection by other pathogens and re-infection by Yptb. The objectives of this application are two-
fold. (1) We will use our expertise in murine infection models and determine if infection with WT-Yptb and a
type III secretion mutant, yscNU, impacts the numbers and functions of M cells in the follicle associated
epithelium. (2) We will build murine organoid/enteroid cell lines that express Cas9 only in developing M cells
and then exploit CRISPR-Cas9 techniques to selectively delete RhoA and other putative Yop targets in M cells.
This will permit us to evaluate the roles of the proteins targeted for inactivation by Yops in M cell homeostasis
and functions. By building these tools and establishing that Yptb infection depletes M cells, we will have a firm
basis to investigate the molecular mechanistic and immunological implications of Yptb-M cell interactions in a
planned R01 proposal.

CD14 is a coreceptor that facilitates the innate immune responses triggered by a broad range of pathogen-
derived molecules and host damage-derived danger signals. These properties, which contribute to the rapid
mobilization of the immune system, can also contribute to the exacerbation of inflammatory immune
responses, particularly when tissue damage is extensive. Because of this, CD14 is an attractive target for the
modulation of the 'cytokine storms' associated with severe bacterial sepsis, cancer immunotherapies, and the
acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) that is seen in severe cases of COVID-19. Tumor necrosis factor
(TNFα) is one of the most prominent inflammatory cytokines associated with these storms, and TNFα-blocking
biologicals have proven useful in treating these inflammatory syndromes. However, we currently lack therapies
for the persistent immune paralysis associated with sepsis and ARDS. Here, we build on recent findings from
our collaborators, who have extended the in vitro coreceptor-like functions of CD14 to the death domain-
containing receptors FAS and TNFR1. This is clinically significant, because it suggests that CD14 participates
in the induction of inflammatory cytokines and in the effector responses set in motion by those very cytokines.
Further studies established that CD14 and TRIF are required for the induction of lethal sepsis by TNFα. In
conjunction with in vitro biochemical data, these findings indicate that CD14 modulates the signals initiated by
TNFR1 in precisely the same way that it augments LPS-induced signals: by engaging endosomal signaling
pathways that act via TRAM, TRIF, TBK1, and IRF3 to promote type-I interferon production and inflammatory
cell death. Thus, CD14 may contribute to septic immunoparalysis by inducing the death of immune cells
exposed to FasL or TNFα. For this reason, it is crucial to understand how CD14 interacts with these receptors.
However, these receptors do not share ligands, and CD14, which is a GPI-anchored protein, lacks the
transmembrane and cytoplasmic regions typically associated with signaling effectors. Via an exhaustive
analysis of the evolutionary histories of CD14, TNFα, and TNFR1, we identified features that appear to have
coevolved in placental mammals and that could plausibly link CD14 to TNFα/TNFR1 complexes. In order to
clarify how CD14 contributes to septic phenomena in vivo, this proposal will evaluate the hypothesized link
between CD14 and TNFα/TNFR1 complexes (Aim 1), and will determine whether CD14 promotes sepsis via
cell-intrinsic signaling events occurring in myeloid cells and/or stromal tissues (Aim 2). These efforts are
intended to rapidly narrow the scope of future enquiry by identifying viable mechanisms with the greatest
explanatory power. In so doing, this work will set the stage for examinations of these pathways in vivo.

Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its receptor TrkB play essential roles in the central regulation
of energy and glucose homeostasis. BDNF signaling greatly influences many aspects of neuronal function,
including survival, differentiation and synaptic plasticity and transmission. Deficits in BDNF function have been
linked to over feeding and severe obesity in humans and mice. Accordingly, we showed that mice with BDNF
depletion in the brain (BDNF2L/2LCk-cre) exhibit increased food intake, obesity, insulin resistance and
dyslipidemia. Diminished a2d-1 (Cacna2d1) function in ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) of BDNF2L/2LCk-cre
mice contributes to the metabolic alterations that they exhibit. In support, viral-mediated rescue of deficient
a2d-1 expression in the VMH of BDNF2L/2LCk-cre mice mitigated their hyperphagia and obesity. Importantly, it
dramatically improved hepatic lipid accumulation and normalized deficits in glycemic control even though
rescued mutants remained significantly heavier than wild type controls. Furthermore, a2d-1 knock down in the
adult VMH resulted in susceptibility to diet-induced obesity (DIO). a2d-1 serves as a receptor for astrocyte-
derived thrombospondins (TSP) to mediate excitatory synapse assembly. Electrophysiological analysis
indicates that the metabolic effects of a2d-1 are related changes in the excitatory tone onto VMH neurons,
implicating thrombospondin signaling. This project will test the hypothesis that TSP/a2d-1 signaling in the
VMH facilitates synaptic remodeling during conditions of positive energy balance to increase the excitatory
drive onto neurons mediating energy, glucose and lipid homeostasis. Aim 1 will determine how gain or loss
of a2d-1 function in the adult VMH affects metabolic function and mechanisms activated by a2d-1 that prevent
hepatic steatosis and glucose intolerance during obesogenic conditions. Aim 2 will examine the effects of gain
or loss of astrocytic TSP function in the adult VMH in the regulation of metabolic function and whether these
effects are a2d-1-dependent. Aim 3 will determine whether a2d-1 and TSP mediates the effects of caloric
status on the excitatory synaptic physiology and activity of VMH neurons. Finally, Aim 4 will map the
connectivity of VMH a2d-1+ neurons, examine their responses to caloric signals in vivo and the effects of
stimulating or inhibiting these cells on metabolic function. Findings from this project will inform novel
mechanisms facilitating metabolic health in individuals who are persistently overweight and new targets for
the treatment of metabolic dysfunction. Importantly, they have the potential to inform pathological
mechanisms underlying metabolic disturbances in individuals administered the anti-epileptic and anti-
nociceptive drugs gabapentin and pregabalin, which bind and inhibit a2d-1.

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the US, accounting for approximately 22% of all cancer
deaths. Annual screening with low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) is recommended in adults aged 50-80
years who have a history of pack-years to 20 and are current smokers or quit in the past 15 years, but
screening with LDCT remains controversial due to the very high false-positive rates, increased radiation
exposures, and costs. Moreover, many adults are diagnosed with lung cancer who are not eligible for
screening. In the 2021 USPSTF recommendation statement, the task force identified “Future Research
Needs,” which includes conducting more research on biomarkers, noting that: “Biomarkers could potentially be
used to identify high-risk candidates for screening with LDCT”. For this project, we propose to measure DNA
methylation levels in blood leukocytes obtained from samples that were collected prior to screening (and at
multiple time points) in participants of the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST). Our first objective is to
develop a pre-screening tool that would classify high-risk participants into additional risk categories to reduce
number of scans needed. Our second objective is to examine whether differences in DNA methylation markers
can distinguish participants with positive screening results who developed lung cancer from those with false
positives (i.e., did not develop cancer). Our third objective is to examine whether differences in DNA
methylation markers can discriminate participants who had a negative scan and were diagnosed with lung
cancer during follow-up and through the end of 2014 from those with a negative scan who did not develop lung
cancer. Using the NLST archived samples will allow us to efficiently evaluate whether DNA methylation
markers can improve models for risk stratification, thus reduce unnecessary scans needed to be performed, as
well as potentially assist in identifying true positive and false negative LDCT scans.

This application seeks continued support for a new project, based on discoveries made during a research
program, funded by the NCI for over 45 years, on biology and evolution of retroviruses and their roles in AIDS
and cancer, with a particular focus on Human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs). The studies described in this
proposal will ccenter on a provirus in the relatively recent HERV-K (HML-2) group that integrated in a site on
chromosome 3, band q12.3 of a common human/gorilla ancestor at least 8 million years ago. In prior work, we
discovered that this provirus has several unique features consistent with its having evolved into a restriction
factor capable of strongly blocking the virion assembly step in replication both of the reconstructed, infectious,
HERV-Kcon and, remarkably, also of HIV. Adaptations to this role include an LTR mutation that leads to
widespread expression in all normal human solid tissues and a mutation (or mutations) in the gag CA encoding
region that lead to transdominant misassembly of the Gag precursor of the infecting virus at the cell membrane.
The current proposal will follow up on these observations with the aims of obtaining a detailed understanding
of the mechanism of co assembly and inhibition of HIV Gag assembly and release, understanding the evolution
of the 3q12.3 provirus and the scope of its activity against other retroviruses, isolation of HIV escape mutants
resistant to 3q12.3 inhibition, and testing the feasibility of using reactivation of the 3q12.3 provirus in HIV target
cells as a novel method of prevention of HIV replication.

patients with B cell malignancies that are refractory to standard treatment. Numerous clinical trials are focused
on improvements of the approach and applications for a much broader range of hematologic malignancies and
solid tumors. However, this targeted therapy is also associated with high relapse rates and the development of
severe toxicities that are challenging to predict. Thus, improved tools to optimize and monitor response are
critically needed. Our ultimate goal is to develop a simple, quantitative, and non-invasive point-of-care device to
monitor CAR-T cell interactions in vivo dynamically with the needed frequency. The objective of this proposal is
to demonstrate proof-of-principle of the approach and its translational potential for human studies. Our approach
relies on in vivo flow cytometry (IVFC) assessments using endogenous and exogenous sources of optical
contrast and its optimization and use to detect CAR-T/B cell interactions in vitro and in vivo. The proposed
method relies on the confocal detection of endogenous light scattering and fluorescence (label-free or LF) signals
of flowing CAR-T/B cells that are interacting. Previous studies support the hypothesis that interacting CAR-T/B
cells will likely yield unique optical signatures. We anticipate that utilization of advanced signal processing
approaches will enable us to optimize detection of these signals in the challenging milieu of flowing blood in vitro
and in vivo. Initial measurements with fluorescent protein (FP)-expressing human CAR-T and B cells spiked in
whole blood will allow us to develop, implement, and assess enhancements in hardware and software to realize
accurate LF-IVFC assessments of interacting CAR-T and B cells. (Aim 1.1). The translational potential will be
tested on blood samples isolated from patients undergoing CAR-T cell therapy at different time points over the
first month of therapy. We expect to detect variations in the numbers of interacting CAR-T and B cells using LF-
IVFC and this expectation will be corroborated with antibody-based flow cytometry measurements (Aim 1.2).
Finally, we will perform in vivo LF and FP-based IVFC measurements using mice infused with human B
lymphoblasts and CAR-T cells at concentrations known to induce variations in the relative circulating levels of
these cells. Our goal will be to demonstrate that LF-IVFC measurements can be performed with high enough

to generate a robust set of data that will motivate development and application of LF-IVFC monitoring of
interacting CAR-T/B cells for dynamic, non-invasive monitoring of patients receiving CAR-T cell therapy. Such a
device may enable acquisition of information regarding individual patient responses with a combined time
resolution and sensitivity/specificity that is not possible to achieve currently. We anticipate such data will yield a
novel paradigm for patient monitoring to optimize response and identify patients that may need more timely
interventions to optimize outcomes.

Much of the world’s music has periodic rhythms with events repeating regularly in time, to which people clap,
move, and sing. The ability to detect and predict periodic auditory rhythms is central to the positive effects of
music-based therapies on a variety of neurological disorders, including improving phonological processing in
dyslexia, enhancing language recovery after stroke, and normalizing gait in Parkinson’s disease. Yet the neural
mechanisms underlying rhythm perception are not well understood, and progress is impeded by the lack of an
animal model that allows precise measurement and manipulation of neural circuits during rhythm perception.
Human neuroimaging studies indicate that perceiving periodic musical rhythms strongly engages the motor
planning system, including premotor cortex and basal ganglia, even when the listener is not moving or preparing
to move. Here, we test the hypothesis that the motor planning system is actively involved in learning to recognize
temporal periodicity and communicates predictions about the timing of periodic events to the auditory system.
We propose to take advantage of the well-described auditory-motor circuits in vocal learning songbirds and
leverage the mechanistic studies possible in an animal model to test these ideas. Like humans (and unlike non-
human primates), vocal learning birds have strong connections between motor planning regions and auditory
regions due to their reliance on complex, learned vocal sequences for communication. Auditory-motor circuits in
songbirds and humans have many structural and functional parallels. Recently, we showed that songbirds can
readily learn to recognize a fundamental periodic pattern (isochrony, or equal timing between events) and can
detect this pattern across a broad range of tempi. In Aim 1, we will test whether neural signals from premotor
regions play a causal role in this ability to flexibly recognize periodic rhythms. In Aim 2, by recording in auditory
cortex while reversibly silencing activity in a reciprocally connected premotor region, we will test whether
premotor signals influence auditory processing of periodic rhythms. In Aim 3, by recording activity in a premotor
region as birds learn to recognize isochrony as a global temporal pattern, we will determine whether premotor
neurons develop sensitivity to temporal regularity and exhibit activity that predicts the timing of upcoming events.
Establishing an animal model for rhythm perception will be transformative for music neuroscience, allowing
detailed investigation of the neural mechanisms underlying rhythm perception and informing rhythm-based
musical interventions to enhance function in normal and disease states.

Chemotherapy remains the standard of care for patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), which
affects 20% of patients with breast cancer. However, 50% of patients with localized TNBC treated with
neoadjuvant chemotherapy display residual cancer burden after treatment and up to 25% of patients who
receive this treatment will suffer metastatic recurrence within five years. The poor association between
chemotherapy and patient outcome emphasizes two major problems for TNBC patients: chemoresistance,
where tumor cells within the local environment are protected and do not die in response to chemotherapy, and
chemotherapy-induced metastasis, where chemotherapy-induced changes in tumor intrinsic properties and the
tumor microenvironment drive invasion which leads to recurrence. Previous studies have demonstrated that
cell migration and extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling are associated with chemoresistant TNBC. The goal
of this proposal is to understand the mechanisms by which the ECM contributes to chemoresistance and
chemotherapy-induced metastasis in TNBC.
We provide preliminary data that individual proteins upregulated in TNBC tumors drive resistance to
chemotherapy drug Paclitaxel and that expression of Cathepsin B (CTSB), a protease which degrades these
ECM proteins into small fragments, protects against the development of chemoresistance. We will dissect the
mechanism by which the protease CTSB and the ECM proteins it degrades influence response to Paclitaxel in
TNBC and whether these fragments can be used to track and target chemoresistance in vivo. We have also
found that chemotherapy treatment leads to changes in the ECM composition of mammary tumors.
Specifically, Paclitaxel treatment leads to an increased abundance of Collagen IV, an ECM protein which
promote invasion and metastasis in TNBC. Our goal is to determine the cell types that secrete ECM proteins
such as Collagen IV after chemotherapy treatment, determine the contribution of these ECM proteins to
chemotherapy-induced metastasis, and whether these pathways can be targeted to prevent the development
of recurrence.
Upon successful completion of the proposed research, our contribution is expected to be an understanding of
how ECM proteins upregulated in TNBC tumors contribute to chemoresistance and how chemotherapy alters
the ECM to promote recurrence and metastatic dissemination. These contributions will be significant because
all TNBC patients receive chemotherapy and metastatic recurrence is a current unmet clinical need. Results
from these studies will provide novel conceptual insights on mechanisms of chemoresistance and
chemotherapy-induced metastasis and will allow us to develop new strategies to track, predict and overcome
chemoresistance in TNBC.

The focus of my lab is to understand the mechanisms of genome instability caused by structure-prone
DNA repeats. We are particularly interested in the mechanisms of repeat expansions that are responsible
for over fifty hereditary diseases in humans. Recent advances in long-read sequencing revealed a new
paradigm: massive genome-wide expansions of structure-prone DNA repeats in human cancers. Thus,
understanding the mechanisms responsible for large-scale repeat expansions is fundamentally important
and has broad biomedical implications.
My lab was the first to show that expandable DNA repeats stall replication fork progression in every
experimental system studied, including bacteria, yeast, and human cells. This led us to propose that
repeats can be added while replication fork escapes from a “repetitive trap”. We first confirmed this idea in
a yeast experimental system. Depending on the mode of replication fork progression through a repeat,
expansions occur by incorporation of unprocessed flaps during Okazaki fragments maturation, replicative
or post-replicative template-switching, or break-induced replication. Recently, we developed a new
experimental system to study large-scale expansions in human cells, which implicates DNA replication as
well. Repeat expansions also occur in terminally differentiated somatic cells that do not undergo DNA
replication. We have, therefore, adjusted our experimental system to study repeat expansions in non-
dividing yeast cells. Our results point to DNA nick repair as a possible mechanism.
We plan to move our research in several directions. First, we will elucidate the role of DNA nick repair in
expansions of Friedreich’s ataxia (FRDA) (GAA)n repeats in dividing and non-dividing yeast cells by
introducing targeted nicks with Cas9 nickases. We will establish its genetic controls and study the role of
the human FAN1 nuclease expressed in yeast. Second, we will unravel the mechanisms of large-scale
repeat expansions in human cells by conducting candidate gene analysis in a plasmid system utilizing
SV40 replication machinery. We will also study the effects of compounds that disrupt or stabilize DNA triplexes
formed by these repeats on their replication and expansion. We will further extend our studies into a different
system based on the EBNA1-dependent replication which involves regular cellular replication fork. Third, we will
carry out structure-functional analysis of other expandable homopurine-homopyrimidine repeats, including the
(AAGGG)n repeat, which is responsible for cerebellar ataxia, neuropathy, vestibular areflexia syndrome
(CANVAS), the (CCCTCT)n repeat that modifies the expressivity of X-linked dystonia parkinsonism (XDP), and
the (GAAA)n repeat, which recurrently expands in many human cancers. At present, there are no data on DNA
structures formed by those repeats or on the mechanisms of their expansions. We will address these matters by
using the broad arsenal of methods and experimental systems developed and existing in the lab.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Project Summary
Physical activity has been associated with several chronic disease markers for the past 25 years, and
countless studies have tested interventions to improve physical activity of sedentary populations. Most of these
intervention studies have attempted to improve physical activity behaviors by changing individual level drivers
of activity, like motivation, attitudes, and self-efficacy for being active. Unfortunately, these efforts to change
activity levels are often not sustained beyond the initial intervention period. One possible cause of this lack of
sustainability is that insufficient attention was paid to environmental factors that facilitate physical activity.
Thus, attention is shifting to more complex environmental and social contributions to physical activity, with the
aim of identifying multi-level strategies to better target interventions to groups that need help. Very few tests of
changing environment levels to increase physical activity exist in the literature. A focus on interventions at
environmental levels, as called for by recent reviews as well as reports from the Institute of Medicine, might
provide the long-term sustainable change that is needed to change physical activity in low-income populations.
This project seeks to test a new multi-level, multi-component package to increase moderate intensity physical
activity levels of people living in public housing developments. Our aims are to evaluate the effects of an
intervention package focused on the environment level to produce changes in moderate physical activity
among public housing residents. Furthermore, we will evaluate the added effects of an efficacy-tested
individual-level eHealth phone program to produce further changes in moderate intensity physical activity. The
design of this study is a prospective, cluster randomized controlled trial, with housing developments as the
units of randomization. In this four group, factorial, cluster randomized controlled trial, we will compare an
environmental intervention alone (E only), an individual intervention alone (I only), an environmental plus
individual intervention (E+I), all against a control group. Mediation and moderation of our intervention will be
assessed. Lastly, we will assess factors from the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research
domains to examine future implementation of a multi-level physical activity intervention among key informants in
public housing developments.

Human babesiosis caused by the hemoparasite Babesia microti is an emerging tick-borne disease in the
United States. Symptoms include fever, chills, sweats, headache, myalgia and anorexia. In young and healthy
individuals, symptoms tend to be few and mild. In individuals >50 years of age and in immunocompromised
patients, symptoms can be severe and hospital admission required. Despite medical care, complications such
as severe anemia, adult respiratory distress syndrome and renal insufficiency or failure can develop. Death is
the outcome in 2-3% of hospitalized cases. Prophylaxis is limited to endemic area avoidance and tick exposure
reduction. These measures have been ineffective in curtailing the emergence of babesiosis. No vaccine is
available and no chemoprophylaxis has been tested for babesiosis. Tafenoquine is approved for pre-exposure
prophylaxis of malaria and radical cure of Plasmodium vivax infection. The prophylactic regimen consists of a
loading dose taken for three consecutive days followed by a weekly maintenance dose until one week after
travel. The therapeutic regimen is a single dose taken along with chloroquine. Tafenoquine has never been
tested as prophylaxis for babesiosis. Pre-clinical studies indicate that i) prompt resolution of B. microti infection
is achieved by single dose tafenoquine but ii) radical cure is attained only if tafenoquine is administered over
several consecutive days. In a recent case report, we were the first to document the therapeutic benefit of
tafenoquine in an elderly immunocompromised patient who suffered from relapsing babesiosis in the context of
broad antimicrobial resistance. Cure was achieved following initiation of tafenoquine. We hypothesize that
tafenoquine can be used for the prophylaxis of babesiosis, including when the host immune response is
weakened by advanced age or severe immune suppression. In Aim #1, we will use the DBA/2J mouse strain to
model the severe babesiosis of old age. We will initiate our studies by infecting young DBA/2J mice and, in
doing so, identify regimens that offer a prospect of conferring prophylaxis in old age. Briefly, we will administer
tafenoquine for three consecutive days during the “window period”, starting on day 3 post-infection. We will
monitor the course of parasitemia from its onset (day 7) until day 35 post-infection. We will ascertain whether
radical cure is achieved by adoptive transfer of blood to rag-deficient mice. We identify the protective regimen
that uses the lowest daily dose and test whether this regimen confers prophylaxis to old DBA/2J mice. We will
detect tafenoquine in plasma by use of LC/MS/MS and identify the maximal concentration and the overall drug
exposure required for prophylaxis in young and old DBA/2J mice. In Aim #2, we will use young rag-deficient
BALB/c mice to model severe immune suppression. We will test whether prophylaxis of rag-deficient mice
requires a daily dose higher than those used for prophylaxis of young and old DBA/2J mice. If successful, the
work will lay the ground for a clinical trial that will test tafenoquine for post-exposure prophylaxis of babesiosis.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：ABSTRACT
 Two clinical measures are currently used to stage chronic kidney disease (CKD), the estimated glomerular
filtration rate (eGFR) and urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR). The elevated morbidity and mortality risk that
is experienced by persons with CKD is overwhelmingly a result of progressive atherosclerotic cardiovascular
disease (ASCVD) and heart failure (HF) rather than kidney failure. Unfortunately, eGFR and ACR inadequately
depict the kidney’s complexity because they represent glomerular function and injury respectively; yet the
kidney is predominantly comprised of tubules, and the kidney tubules are responsible for myriad homeostatic
functions that likely have more direct influence on the cardiovascular system than does damage to the
glomerulus. Moreover, pathology studies have convincingly demonstrated that tubule damage is more
prognostic for loss of kidney function than glomerular scarring.
 Novel urine measures that quantify the health of the kidney tubules have recently allowed us to define four
additional dimensions of kidney health that independently influence risk for progressive CKD: proximal tubule
injury, proximal tubule function, tubule fibrosis and repair, and tubule synthetic function. Our team has selected
eight distinct urine measures that capture each of these four dimensions and comprise the Kidney Tubule
Health Panel (KTHP). In specific, high-risk populations, the KTHP dimensions are strongly associated with risk
for ASCVD, HF and mortality; but no studies have evaluated the contributions of kidney tubule health to the
development of ASCVD and HF in the general population. Our global hypothesis is that kidney tubule damage
and dysfunction are related to the onset and progression of ASCVD and HF.
 Within two well-established, general population cohorts, CARDIA and MESA, this proposal will address the
following research questions that are critical to understanding the development of each dimension of kidney
tubule disease and their role in promoting ASCVD and HF: 1) Does kidney tubule disease develop earlier and
progress faster with advancing age than ACR and eGFR? 2) Is kidney tubule disease more severe in Black
and Hispanic persons compared with White persons? 3) Which atherosclerotic risk factors have the strongest
associations with each dimension of kidney tubule disease? 4) How strongly associated is kidney tubule
disease with several subclinical CVD measures? 5) How strongly associated are kidney tubule disease
markers with ASCVD and HF, and do they improve prediction of these endpoints? If these Aims are
successful, these easily measured, non-invasive indices of kidney tubule health may have value for population
screening, to provide insights into race/ethnic differences in kidney and cardiovascular disease, and to
identifying pathways for novel therapeutics that target kidney tubules, such as the SGLT2 inhibitors and the
non-steroidal aldosterone antagonists, that reduce risk for both kidney and cardiovascular adverse outcomes.

Athymic patients, or those born without a thymus, have a complete absence of functional T cells; such patients
will die within the first two years of life without functional T cells from complications associated with
immunodeficiency. There are several causes of athymia, including 22q11.2 deletion (i.e., DiGeorge Syndrome),
which is estimated to occur in 1 in 3,000 to 6,000 live births with reports suggesting even higher prenatally (as
frequent as 1 in 992). Roughly 0.5-1% of these patients have a complete lack of T cells called Complete
DiGeorge. These patients all require a thymic implant to restore T cells in their immune system to prevent death.
Current treatment approaches rely on harvesting primary tissue from children during open-heart procedures, an
approach that is not scalable and is limited by scarcity of tissues. Moreover, supply is further limited as there
must be minimal HLA matching between donor and recipient, which may contribute to post-thymus implant
autoimmunity. Thymmune Therapeutics, Inc. (“Thymmune”) has developed proprietary insights in thymic
differentiation from pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and is using this knowledge to develop a cell-based
therapy (“THY-001”) for patients with athymia that addresses the key issues associated with current
treatment methods (i.e., collection and availability of tissues). The Thymmune team has a collective 100+
years of drug development experience to support this effort. Importantly, our previous development work has
shown that upon transplantation, our thymic epithelial progenitor cells (TEPs) differentiate in vivo into thymic
epithelial cells (TECs), forming thymic like tissues, though the composition of these grafts are variable. In this
SBIR Fast Track proposal, Thymmune will improve upon its existing protocol to produce its TEPs in a scalable
and reproducible manner necessary for clinical applications and establish the thymopoietic potential of this
therapy in vivo for the treatment of athymia. In Phase I, we will develop a differentiation protocol for TEPs in full
suspension conditions to enable industrial scale-up of THY-001 and derive a set of biomarkers that can be used
to define the cell product in anticipation of regulatory requirements for taking THY-001 into the clinic. In Phase II
work, we will test the in vivo function of the iPSC-TEPs that we have developed following our optimized protocol
developed in Phase I. Also in Phase II, we will develop a protocol for thymic engraftment in skeletal muscle
transplantation since current practices for thymic cell tissue therapy experiments in animals transplant tissue
directly into the subrenal capsule, which is not a clinically viable site. This SBIR Fast Track proposal will
establish the necessary protocols for commercial production of TEPs, determine their efficacy in vivo,
and establish a translatable method for transplantation to advance THY-001, Thymmune’s stem-cell
derived thymic cell therapy to treat patients with athymia. Following this work, we will test our cell product
in large pre-clinical animal model and prepare for submission of pre-IND and IND applications.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Molecularly targeted cancer therapies, such as Abl-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), have
converting many terminal cancers, including chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), into chronic diseases.
Despite the targeted approach, vascular toxicities have emerged. Specifically, the first-generation CML
TKI imatinib is safe, yet newer generation TKIs frequently used for resistant CML (nilotinib, dasatinib,
ponatinib) confer a 2-5 fold increased risk of arterial thrombosis causing MI, stroke, or limb ischemia.
With no validated models to test for vascular toxicity prior to drug approval, this side effect was identified
only when adverse events accrued and once recognized, there are no data to guide clinicians as to how
to prevent this or to treat these cancer survivors. This proposal addresses these gaps in knowledge by
leveraging the CML TKIs, a drug class with both safe and toxic members. We and others showed that
toxic CML TKIs damage ECs in some in vitro models and enhance atherosclerosis in mice. As CML
patients with underlying CV risk factors are predisposed to toxicity, we hypothesize that the toxic CML
drugs impair specific endothelial cell (EC) functions that lead to plaque development, inflammation,
rupture, thrombosis and ischemia. As these drugs are kinase inhibitors, we further posit that the toxicity
is caused by modulation of the phosphorylation state of signaling proteins in a manner that is deleterious
to EC function and have shown this using proteomic approaches. Thus, we now propose to test the
hypothesis that toxic CML TKIs act on ECs to impair barrier integrity, enhance leukocyte trafficking, slow
wound healing, and increase interaction with platelets, thereby promoting an atherosclerosis phenotype
prone to rupture and thrombosis, and that the drug-induced EC proteomic profile can predict vascular
toxicity and identify mitigating treatments. We test this with 2 aims using multiple innovative approaches:
SA1 interrogates the impact of each CML TKI using human engineered microvessels (hEMVs) to
examine the impact on vascular permeability and platelet aggregation and in mice using intravital
microscopy to quantify leukocyte-EC interaction, carotid wire injury to measure vascular re-
endothelialization, and Apo-E-KO mice with FACS to quantify vascular inflammation in atherosclerosis.
SA2 uses a targeted mass spectrometry based phosphoproteomic assay to profile the effects of emerging
CML TKIs and a broad range of drugs approved for CV disease in human ECs to determine if this can
predict toxicity of new TKIs and identify mitigating therapies. Predicted toxicities and “antidotes” that
oppose the toxic proteomic signature will be tested using the in vitro and in vivo models described in SA1.
Completion of the aims will transform cardiooncology by validating preclinical models to predict vascular
safety of CML TKIs and identify potential treatments for vascular toxicity that can be rapidly translated to
cardiooncology care.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Excessive sugar and fat consumption can lead to a range of metabolic abnormalities including non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), hypercholesterolemia, dyslipidemia, obesity, and insulin resistance. Emerging evidence points to a new mechanism linking carbon metabolism and fatty liver disease to the G protein-coupled Protease Activated Receptor-2 (PAR2), a receptor previously known to be involved in inflammation. To provide key support for the potential importance of hepatic PAR2 in humans, in a cross-sectional study of liver specimens and clinical data from 108 NAFLD patients and controls, we found that PAR2 protein expression in hepatocytes was low in control livers and progressively increased in patients with mild NAFLD fibrosis and in NAFLD with higher stages of fibrosis. The high PAR2-expressing NAFLD patient cohort had significantly elevated plasma LDL cholesterol as compared to the low PAR2-expressing cohort. However, a definitive role for PAR2 in metabolism, cholesterol homeostasis, and liver pathology remains unknown. The overarching goal of this grant proposal is to examine the role of PAR2 signaling in the etiology and pathogenesis of fatty liver disease to test our central hypothesis that hepatic PAR2 is a novel contributor of hypertriglyceridemia, obesity, and insulin resistance. PAR2 is expressed by many tissues and cell types and a conventional mouse whole-body knockout (KO) has been used to date. Therefore, it is unclear how much of the KO phenotype or effects of PAR2 inhibition on steatosis, lipid metabolism, and weight loss is mediated only at the level of the hepatocyte and how much is due to loss of PAR2 at other sites of expression. We will use our new hepatocyte-specific PAR2-KO, PAR2∆Hep mice to define and validate the specific involvement of liver PAR2 in these profound metabolic effects in aims 1-3. It is unclear how PAR2 promotes insulin resistance in diet-induced obesity models. Aim 2 will explore a novel mechanism whereby PAR2 activates a Gq-PLC pathway to stimulate calcium flux and CaMKK2 to interfere in insulin activation of AKT-glucose signaling. To explain our preliminary data that global PAR2-deficiency lowers basal plasma glucose, but increases liver glucose and glycogen in both lean and obese mouse models, Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that hepatocyte PAR2 suppresses the major liver glucose transporter GLUT2 through a mechanism potentially involving Gq-MAPK-FoxA3. Aims 1-3 will utilize our pepducin technology developed to allosterically target G-protein coupled receptors on the inside surface of the plasma membrane to help delineate specific PAR2-effector signaling pathways in aberrant liver metabolism and insulin resistance in vitro and in vivo.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Accurate assessment of kidney function is fundamental to the care of all patients, but current methods to
estimate GFR have error rates of 35-60% in important populations as well as variable accuracy across race,
ethnicity and geography, leading to errors in critical decisions, drug dosing, and determination of prognosis.
Current GFR estimates include a coefficient for Black vs non-Black which may restrict access to care. As a
result, there are critical knowledge gaps in evaluation and management of GFR in health and disease.
Our goal is to develop a valid and robust GFR estimate optimized for an individual person that meets the
critical unmet need for a confirmatory test. The confirmatory test will use a panel of endogenous filtration
markers to estimate GFR (peGFR) from a single blood sample using an equation that does not require serum
creatinine or demographic characteristics. Our research team has extensive experience in biomarker
evaluation, GFR estimation, epidemiology, laboratory science and metabolomics. Our preliminary data
provide proof of concept that a panel of novel metabolites that does not include serum creatinine or
demographics can eliminate bias and greatly improve precision of GFR estimates in patients with heart failure
and reduced muscle mass; and that novel techniques can be used to produce a high-accuracy and
parsimonious prediction model.
Aim 1 Using global metabolomic discovery (~1000+ metabolites) on five cohorts (N=2583), we will select
candidate metabolites based on maximal joint association with mGFR as well as biological and physiological
assessment of their properties as filtration markers. Markers that show acceptable analytical properties in initial
testing will be incorporated into a liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometer (LC-MS/MS) multiplex
assay. Aim 2: We propose to use a spectrum of novel approaches, such as marginalizing predictions to down-
weight outlier metabolites and kernel nearest neighbor weighted average predictions, to maximize precision as
well as robustness across multiple diverse populations and to compare these approaches to a benchmark
model developed using superlearner ensemble modeling techniques. Development and external validation in
~3036 and ~3465 participants across 8 and 12 studies, respectively. Aim 3: We propose to evaluate the
impact of panel eGFR in patients with heart and liver failure (N=1796) on clinical decisions and outcomes.
The expected outcome is development of panel eGFR that can be used as a confirmatory test and ultimately
incorporated into clinical practice guidelines. The proposal is highly innovative as it is comprehensive
spanning discovery, validation, assessment of clinical utility in populations not previously been studied and use
of novel statistical methods to compute individualized GFR estimates. The proposal is significant because it
will enable generalizable and accurate individualized GFR estimates in health and disease, particularly
diseases with unacceptably GFR estimation high error rates and diverse racial, ethnic and geographic groups.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：There is increasing recognition of the importance of patient-reported outcomes (PROs) for assessment of health-
related quality of life in both research and clinical settings. PROs are especially important for inherently subjective
but crucial clinical phenomena such as pain, mood, and fatigue. Despite much research in PROs, concerns
about reliability and validity persist, especially when used at the individual level, particularly among patients who
may struggle to understand PRO questions, such as those with low health literacy or undetected cognitive
impairment. Over the past decade, we have developed and tested a tool with the potential to enhance PROs at
the individual level – embodied conversational agents (ECA), which are computer characters that simulate face-
to-face conversation using voice, hand gestures, gaze cues and other nonverbal behavior. We have successfully
used them in behavioral interventions for populations with limited health literacy, elderly patients, and patients
with cancer. Face-to-face encounters, in conjunction with written instructions supported by pictures, remains one
of the best methods for communicating information in general, but is particularly effective for individuals with
limited health literacy. We have also demonstrated that ECAs can be used as valid alternatives to standard
paper-based surveys for substance use screening, and that the display of empathy for patients and other
relational behavior by ECAs leads to increased engagement by patients over time. We will adapt our prior work
on ECAs to produce ECA-PRO, a framework for administering PROs over time using an ECA on patients’
smartphones in English and Spanish. The ECA-PRO system will include novel user interfaces to optimally
communicate the results to patients and clinicians using clear visualizations. To demonstrate the generalizability
of ECA-PRO, we will focus on two clinical scenarios: 1) longitudinal monitoring of symptoms and quality of life in
patients undergoing cancer treatment, and 2) monitoring of medication adherence in patients taking long-term
oral anti-cancer drugs. We hypothesize that the ECA-PRO system, designed for individual-patient-level
interactions and data collection, will improve the reliability, validity, and overall clinical relevance of PROs
collected during cancer treatment. We will develop and evaluate a PRO system that engages patients with
interactive communication and empathy, while delivering standard PROs in a way that minimizes missing data
and enables user-friendly visual sharing of results. The ECA-PRO system will create a strong foundation for
PRO-based clinical decision-making. If successful, these tools can be rapidly and broadly disseminated.

 Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) is associated with excellent cure rates. Despite early disease control, this success
comes at considerable cost, with treatment-induced morbidity (“late effects” [LE]) that manifests as early as a
year after therapy (e.g., 2nd cancers, cardiovascular [CVD] disease), compromised health-related quality of life
(HRQL), and early mortality. Over the past 20 years, while important HL clinical trials have been conducted,
there has been a lack of consensus about the preferred approach to treatment, considering both short- and
longer term outcomes. While clinical trials provide rich information about short term disease outcomes, they do
not follow efficacy beyond 5 years and rarely track post-therapy morbidity. In contrast, HL registries capture
longitudinal outcomes and can be linked to other sources including healthcare utilization via administrative
claims and cancer registries to characterize LE and survival. This proposal represents an unprecedented
opportunity to draw on the collective expertise of International clinical HL oncology experts, epidemiologists,
imaging experts, and methods & modeling experts with access to individual patient data from modern HL clinical
trials and real-world registries from across the world. In preparation for the project, we harmonized individual
patient data (IPD) for >12,000 HL patients from 12 clinical trials and 4 large HL registries. Building on data
science principles, we established a common data model & unifying data dictionary, which allows us to expand
the current database over time, incorporating future data as they become available. We will harness these multi-
source data to first, create a modern prediction model via predictive modeling of pre-treatment clinical factors;
second, we will estimate and validate disease progression and early emergent late effects, enhanced by the
addition of interim PET imaging data and alternative treatment options via multi-state Cox proportional hazards
models to estimate transition probabilities; and third, we will generate a dynamic decision model to project
precalculated outcomes of interest, such as short term and longer term outcomes, including HRQL, The
aggregated, “standardized” precalculated visualizations/projections (life expectance and quality-adjusted life
years) will provide a basis for comparing alternative treatments for a broad range of disease subgroups and
patient characteristics “on the fly.” Furthermore, both the results of the statistical models & parameter estimates
from the simulation model will be validated and re-calibrated as needed in large external cohorts (i.e., German
Hodgkin Study Group (GHSG) clinical trials data and Dutch HL registry). The simulation model will then be
converted to open source, which will allow local analyses that go beyond our precalculated standard scenarios.
Our three-step approach (predictive modeling to multi-state modeling to simulation/decision modeling) will be
designed to incorporate future prospective data as new/novel treatments, and knowledge emerges over time.
Overall, this project’s results will be significant as they are expected to delineate precise outcomes & optimal
therapy for individual HL patients and inform the development of models and paradigms for other diseases.

Baseline reduced kidney function is highly prevalent among patients with acute heart failure (AHF) and is one
of the most powerful risk factors for adverse clinical outcomes. The association between acute kidney function
declines and outcomes, however, remain controversial, with some studies showing acute declines in estimated
glomerular filtration (eGFR) to be associated with worse outcomes but other studies not. The goal of Dr.
McCallum’s proposal is to better understand the mechanisms of acute eGFR declines that occur in the setting
of AHF and examine how acute eGFR declines are related to outcomes including long term kidney function,
mortality and AHF hospitalizations. The overall hypothesis is that three key components—congestion,
cardiac hemodynamics, and neurohormonal (NH) activity—are the primary risk factors for acute eGFR
declines, and that the relation between acute eGFR declines and clinical outcomes needs to be interpreted
within the context of changes in these three factors. In order to examine these relations, her Aims would
include 1) retrospective analysis of patients admitted to Tufts Medical Center for AHF and requiring a
pulmonary artery (PA) catheter (n=890) for repeated measures of congestion and cardiac hemodynamics; 2)
prospective enrollment of 140 patients admitted to Tufts Medical Center for AHF with an indwelling PA catheter
to assay for repeated measures of plasma NH activity; and 3) adoption of multi-trajectory modeling to develop
clinical phenotypes of acute cardiorenal syndrome (CRS) by incorporating trajectories of eGFR change,
congestion, cardiac hemodynamics, and NH activity. The career development plan incorporates didactic
training in longitudinal data analysis including joint modeling and multi-trajectory modeling, biomarker
methodology, introductory informatics for electronic health record research, as well as immersion and practical
training in cardiac hemodynamics and prospective patient recruitment, all under the mentorship of an
experienced group of nephrologists, cardiologists and statisticians with expertise in various aspects of the
CRS. Successful completion of these aims is feasible, as shown by Dr. McCallum’s preliminary data under her
institutional KL2 funding, as well her track record of productivity under her primary mentor Dr. Mark Sarnak.
Her co-mentor will be Dr. Jeffrey Testani, a cardiologist and Director of Heart Failure Research at Yale
University who has expertise in the CRS, has collaborated with Dr. McCallum on several manuscripts, and has
incorporated her into his research group and sponsored several trips for her to his research lab at Yale. With
this K23 award, Dr. McCallum will receive extensive training in biostatistical methods, dataset creation, CRS
pathophysiology, biomarker methodology, primary data collection and prospective study design. In aggregate,
completion of these aims will provide Dr. McCallum with expertise in the CRS and arm her with the tools
necessary to successfully compete for independent funding.

Although Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS) is an urgent public health priority, the diagnosis and
management of NAS remains challenging. This is primarily due to the multifactorial nature of NAS and the
highly subjective measures to assess this condition. Males and females with NAS have distinct risk profiles, yet
within the current paradigm they are managed uniformly. The limited understanding of long-term outcomes
further compounds the problem and predisposes this population to a myriad of health issues. To address these
knowledge gaps, the current proposal expands upon the molecular and behavioral data from our K12-funded
pilot study to better understand the impact of prenatal opioid exposure. An early sign of withdrawal in opioid-
exposed neonates is difficulty feeding followed by hyperphagia, which often precedes severe NAS and the
need for pharmacotherapy. Using saliva collected immediately after birth, we showed higher expression of a
key reward gene (DRD2) in opioid-exposed males compared to females. The expression of DRD2 also
correlated with the caloric intake in opioid-exposed males who later developed severe NAS and required
pharmacotherapy. These transcriptomic-behavioral data indicate that prenatal opioid exposure dysregulates
brain reward signaling in a sex-specific manner, resulting in hyperphagia as a reward-seeking behavior that
offsets the acute loss of opioids. Furthermore, opioid-exposed neonates have heightened expression of
inflammatory genes (IL6, MCP1) that correlate with the expression of DRD2, particularly in females. Expanding
on these preliminary results, the current proposal will examine if prenatal opioids dysregulate brain reward
signaling and modulate pro-inflammatory pathways with increased sex-specific risks for hyperphagia and
associated long-term cardiometabolic disorders. Our overarching goal is to understand changes in sex-specific
reward and inflammatory gene expression in opioid-exposed neonates throughout the first year of life. The
hypothesis will be tested in two aims: 1) Identify sex-specific effects of prenatal opioids on reward signaling
and inflammation, 2) Evaluate effects of prenatal opioids on risk for subsequent cardiometabolic disorders. We
will collect serial saliva samples from 56 opioid-exposed and 56 sex- and age-matched non-exposed neonates
during the initial hospitalization and then in a subset of infants post hospital discharge up to 1 year of age to
evaluate the expression of reward and inflammation genes. Early cardiometabolic risk will be assessed using
serum lipid panels at 1 year of age, along with growth and nutritional data. Results will be analyzed by sex. The
impact of this proposed project lies in the potential to advance the field with a more comprehensive
understanding of the sex-specific impact of prenatal opioid exposure on the developing brain through non-
invasive molecular analyses, enabling personalized medicine and longitudinal health monitoring.

This is an application for a K23 award for Dr. Shanthini Kasturi, a rheumatologist at Tufts Medical Center. Dr.
Kasturi seeks to establish herself as an independent investigator of patient-centered behavioral interventions
for rheumatic diseases, with an initial focus on systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The goal of this proposal
is to develop (Aim 1) and pilot test (Aim 2) a theory-driven peer coaching intervention to reduce fatigue, a
critical unmet need of patients with SLE. These research objectives are paired with training objectives to build
expertise in behavioral intervention development and skills in clinical trial design and conduct. In Aim 1, Dr.
Kasturi will design an intervention that targets the multidimensional components of fatigue through
individualized coaching administered by trained peers with SLE. Coaches will leverage validated patient-
reported outcome measures to tailor behavior change support to patients’ specific drivers of fatigue. The
intervention will be deployed via a mobile health application and be iteratively refined with the input of SLE
patients using user-centered design methodologies. In Aim 2, Dr. Kasturi will conduct a randomized controlled
pilot trial to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention in patients with SLE. To achieve these
goals, Dr. Kasturi has assembled an expert mentorship team and formulated the following training objectives:
(1) to build expertise in behavioral intervention development, including health behavior theory and research
methods, patient-engaged intervention development methods, and the use of mobile health interventions for
behavior change; and (2) to develop skills in clinical trial design and conduct, including advanced
methodologies for randomized behavioral trials and the conduct of multi-site trials. This project aligns with the
priorities outlined in the NIH Action Plan for Lupus Research through its focus on fatigue, its goal of developing
a behavioral intervention, and its integration of validated patient-reported outcome measures and mobile health
technology to enhance the intervention. This proposal will form the basis for a future R01 to test the efficacy of
the peer coaching intervention on fatigue in SLE, while supporting Dr. Kasturi’s development as a research
scientist with expertise in behavioral interventions for rheumatic diseases.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Project Summary
Covert cerebrovascular disease (CCD), comprising covert brain infarction (CBI) and white matter disease
(WMD), is commonly found incidentally on neuroimaging scans obtained in routine clinical care. CBI is
believed to be pathophysiologically similar to clinically-evident stroke, but with infarct locations in clinically less
articulate parts of the brain. Epidemiologic studies based on MRI-screened cohorts indicate that CBI is far
more common than clinically-evident stroke, and WMD is even more common. Both types of CCD are strong,
independent risk factors for future stroke and dementia. The American Heart Association/American Stroke
Association has identified CCD as a major priority for new studies on stroke prevention. Identifying high-risk
individuals prior to the onset of severe cognitive decline is a central goal in dementia prevention research.
However, application of insights from studies of MRI-screened cohorts to patients with incidentally-discovered
CCD is not straightforward. Patients are not screened but are selected for clinically-indicated neuroimaging;
real-world imaging is dominated by CT scans; neuroimaging interpretation and reporting are heterogeneous
and poorly standardized. Additionally, there are no ICD-9 codes for CBI or WMD, which also do not generally
appear in a patient’s problem list or in structured fields of electronic health records. Indeed, both patients and
their providers are often unaware of these findings even after they are detected. Our team has performed the
first large-scale study of the prevalence and prognostic importance of incidentally-discovered (id)-CCD using
natural language processing (NLP) algorithms and created a real-world cohort comprising approximately
250,000 stroke- and dementia-free patients over age 50 who received either head CT or MRI, approximately
30% of whom have id-CCD. These NLP-identified id-CBI and id-WMD are both strong predictors of future
clinically-evident stroke and dementia. While this cohort has yielded important insights, there are substantial
limitations. Extractable information on WMD severity is frequently missing. Even when present in text reports,
only relatively crude information on WMD burden can be obtained. Further, other evidence of CCD—including
microbleeds, microinfarcts, prominent perivascular spaces—may also be prognostically important. Finally,
direct image analysis may discover new radiomic biomarkers predictive of future stroke and dementia that are
not captured or unknown. The ambitious goal of this project is to develop a clinically useful algorithm that can
directly read routinely obtained neuroimaging scans at scale and relate findings to stroke and dementia
outcomes through the following specific aims: Aim 1: Develop a deep learning model to identify and
characterize covert id-CCD from routinely obtained CT and MRI neuroimages and use these features, and
other deep radiomic biomarkers, to predict the development of future stroke and dementia. Aim 2: Test the
deep learning algorithms developed in Aim 1 on a large cohort of patients from an integrated health system for
the prediction of future stroke and dementia to evaluate their incremental prognostic value.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：The treatment of cancer has been revolutionized by the development of targeted and immune-based therapies.
However, many of these new therapies, as well as established ones such as doxorubicin, can damage the heart
and cause severe heart failure. A growing body of evidence suggests that perturbations in cardiomyocyte
autophagy may play a central role in chemotherapy-induced heart failure, and the ability to image this process
in vivo could provide important insights. We have recently developed an autophagy-detecting nanoparticle (ADN)
and have used this agent to image autophagy in the heart during chemotherapy with doxorubicin and dasatanib.
The core of the agent consists of ferumoxytol, an MRI-detectable nanoparticle, to which several polyarginine-
Cy5.5 moieties are attached. The polyarginine peptides facilitate the translocation of the agent into the cell,
where it is taken up by autophagosomes and trafficked to the lysosomes. Folding of the polyarginine peptides
also results in stacking and quenching of the Cy5.5 fluorochromes until the peptides are cleaved by cathepsins
in the autophagolysosomes. We have shown using chemical inhibitors/stimulators of autophagy, and cells with
genetic deletion of the key autophagy proteins ATG5 and ATG7, that the activation of ADN is specific for
autophagy. Likewise, using a transgenic mouse with overexpression of the DDiT4L transcription factor in the
heart and the canonical autophagy model of intermittent fasting, we have shown that ADN can detect autophagy
in vivo with a high degree of sensitivity and specificity. In this proposal we will use ADN to interrogate changes
in autophagy in both the heart and cancer. While the upregulation of autophagy in the heart is protective, it has
the potential to either protect or harm tumors undergoing chemotherapy. We hypothesize that the imaging of
autophagy with ADN will allow conditions and strategies to be identified where the upregulation of autophagy is
cardioprotective but does not attenuate the effect of the chemotherapy on the tumor. In aim 1 of the proposal,
we will make a small chemical modification to the probe, enabling it to be detected before and after its activation,
and use confocal/super-resolution microscopy of live cells to develop a detailed kinetic model of autophagy.
IPSC-derived cardiomyocytes and relevant tumor cell lines will be studied. In aim 2 we will assess the impact of
autophagy upregulation on a library of tumor cell lines exposed to a large panel of chemotherapies, many known
to cause heart failure. In aim 3 we will use a multispectral fluorescence approach to image autophagy, apoptosis
and inflammation in the heart and in tumors in mice in vivo. The impact of autophagy upregulation will be
assessed and a detailed kinetic model of autophagy in the heart and in tumors will be derived. Execution of the
proposed aims will provide important insights into the role of autophagy in the heart and cancer, and provide a
platform to identify safe and effective autophagy regulating strategies to protect the heart during chemotherapy.

The avascular cornea is innervated by a dense network of sensory processes derived from the ophthalmic and
maxillary regions of the trigeminal ganglion. Corneal nerves provide not only mechanical, chemical, and thermal
sensitivity to the front of the eye but also release nutrients and trophic factors that supply the cornea. Structural
and functional nerve abnormalities are the hallmarks of neurotrophic keratopathy, a degenerative disease
associated with impaired corneal healing and ulceration. These abnormatilies can also be observed in other
conditions known to cause corneal damage, such as dry eye. Most therapeutic approaches aimed to promote
corneal nerve regeneration focus on providing neurotrophic support. Recently, the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration has approved the use of recombinant nerve growth factor eye drops for the treatment of
neurotrophic keratopathy, but its use has been associated with several adverse effects and limitations.
 This proposal centers on a major gap in our understanding of the inhibitory mechanisms hampering corneal
nerve regeneration, which could prove important to develop new strategies to promote functional reinnervation.
Research during the last decade has consistently found increased levels of the carbohydrate-binding protein
galectin-3 in the tear fluid and corneal epithelium of patients with ocular surface disease. Importantly, the areas
where increased galectin-3 expression has been observed coincide with the location of intraepithelial nerve
terminals and the basal nerve plexus. It is become increasingly clear that multimerization of galectin-3 leads to
cross-linking of carbohydrate ligands and the formation of lattice-like structures on plasma membranes essential
for regulating cell survival or degeneration. We hypothesize that overabundance of galectin-3 promotes
degenerative signaling by interacting with specific surface receptors in peripheral sensory neurons and may
constitute an important therapeutic target for the full recovery of nerve sensation in corneal disease.
 The following specific aims will address this objective: (1) to examine the role of galectin-3 in modulating
neurotrophic signaling, (2) to determine the impact of galectin-3 on the neural mechanisms underlying corneal
disease, and (3) to investigate whether whether therapeutic inhibition of galectin-3 improves corneal nerve
regeneration and sensation. It is anticipated that the successful conclusion of this project will reveal a novel
mechanism by which galectin-3 regulates neurotrophic signaling in corneal nerves. Results could potentially
advance the field of corneal nerve regeneration by targeting the pathological actions of galectin-3 and lead to
the development of novel therapies to promote functional innervation.

Our objective is to develop tools that improve early diagnosis of systemic light-chain (AL) amyloidosis, a disease
that causes heart and kidney failure and early death, in patients with smoldering multiple myeloma, a disease in
which patients make immunoglobulin free light chains but are relatively asymptomatic. Based on a retrospective
study in members of the US Armed Forces who developed AL, there is a 10 to 15 year precursor period prior to
patients presenting at a median age of 63 with symptoms of AL due to toxic free light chains (FLC) and amyloid
deposits. In similar studies of patients with smoldering myeloma we know that 2% of them develop AL, meaning
that 2% have FLC that are markedly abnormal. Over half of new AL patients present with heart involvement and
it is the failure to diagnose early that underlies their 20% mortality within 6 months. In this application, we seek
support to screen patients with smoldering multiple myeloma for undiagnosed AL and risk of AL using a series
of criteria that will increase our knowledge of the likelihood of having undiagnosed AL or of being at risk for AL.
Only efforts to diagnose AL and determine risk of AL in the precursor phase of the disease will reduce the early
mortality rate. Our goal is to develop a likelihood algorithm for undiagnosed AL and risk of AL in smoldering
myeloma patients and our aims in this application are to create a network to enroll 340 patients with smoldering
multiple myeloma (SMM) on a collaborative study requiring marrow and blood specimens and collection of data
for a training set of likelihood statistics and to plan the future validation study and to validate an next generation
sequence (NGS) assay that identifies IGVL genes in clonal plasma cells. The clonal κ and λ IGVL genes in AL
cases are restricted AL-related sets of genes. The likelihood algorithm will employ 5 parameters: (1) the presence
of SMM; (2) a difference between involved (pathologic) and uninvolved FLC > 23mg/L; (3) clonal plasma cell
cytogenetics showing t(11;14) or gain 1q, (4) AL-related κ or λ IGVL genes by NGS, and (5) NT-proBNP >
332pg/mL. All subjects will have their clonal IGVL genes identified by NGS enabling the creation and validation
of a laboratory developed test in a precision medicine laboratory that is certified under regulations of the Clinical
Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA). Our long-term goal is to overcome the current inability in
patients with SMM to effectively assess for the presence of occult AL or to estimate the likelihood of developing
AL. By determining the values of the 5 parameters we will create the training set for an algorithm to estimate the
likelihood of having or progressing to AL and will be able to design the validation study. We have assembled a
collaborative team of investigators at centers across the USA to pursue our aims and an expert support group
to address the opportunities, challenges and patient care issues that will arise. We have put together a team of
expert collaborators from over a dozen academic centers and expert consultants in myeloma, AL amyloidosis,
molecular biology and protein biology, in order to pursue these aims, realizing the complexity of the endeavor
and the demands of each aim.

TETmedical Inc. is developing a tethered enzyme technology (TET) for rapid point-of-care (PoC) and/or at-home
testing of liver enzyme levels, enabling convenient and timely tracking of drug-induced liver injury (DILI) and
other sources of liver damage. When the liver is damaged or diseased, the enzymes aspartate aminotransferase
(AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) are released into the blood, making these the most frequently used
markers of hepatocellular injury. Because the liver is the primary site of drug metabolism, patients’ AST and ALT
levels are often evaluated to monitor DILI as a key component of clinical trials to determine drug safety. Currently,
to have the test performed, patients must travel to a clinic to have a blood sample drawn, which is then tested in
an in-house laboratory or mailed off to a central laboratory testing facility. Visits to the clinic place a burden on
the elderly and/or those with limited mobility, and add a geographic constraint to clinical trial participants,
reducing the diversity of subjects. The testing process is slow, burdensome, and costly, and severely limits the
frequency of testing and the speed with which a problem can be detected. In response to this need, TETmedical
is advancing a simple, rapid, and affordable test for AST/ALT measurement that can be performed at the PoC
or in the patient’s own home based on a biomimetic approach to oriented immobilization of enzymes on
nanoparticles (NPs). This method significantly improves the efficiency of coupled enzymatic reactions and is
based on the TET platform that enables ultra-rapid, highly sensitive, and quantitative detection of analytes. Of
note, TETmedical has enabled luminescence readouts of AST/ALT in the highly reducing environment of human
serum/plasma, thus overcoming a challenge that prevented luminescent quantification of AST/ALT.
TETmedical’s AST/ALT test will include disposable cartridges with the TET biosensor embedded on a paper-
based blood separator and, due to a recent partnership, a lancet based blood sample collection device to enable
repeated at-home testing of liver enzymes. Once the sample is added to the cartridge, it will then be inserted
into an electronic reader that will measure the luminescence-based readout and provide a quantitative result.
For this Phase I project, TETmedical’s Specific Aims are: 1) Optimize the tethered enzyme assays for detection
of AST and ALT including the speed, range of detection, and calibration of luminescence outputs, 2) Improve
separation of blood components and design of cartridges, and 3) Validate technology using spiked human blood
samples. Completion of these Aims will result in a cartridge integrating blood separation and TET biosensors to
quantify AST and ALT, and controls for hemolysis, which are already under development. This will provide the
necessary proof of concept for a future Phase II application, which will include a validation study in clinical
samples, integration with the at-home blood collection device, and further development of the prototype
electronic reader device, enabling simple PoC or at-home use.

 There is an enormous need for qualified people to pursue careers in STEM (Noonan,
2017). However, the lack of a strong foundation in mathematics means students are less likely
to pursue STEM majors and careers (Chen, 2013; Griffith, 2010; Huang, Taddese, & Walter, E,
2000; Kokkelenberg & Sinha, 2010; Lowell et. al., 2009; Seo, Shen & Alfaro, 2019). Students
from low-income families, women, and underrepresented minorities are also less likely to major
in STEM (Bettinger, 2010; Griffith, 2010; Hill, Corbett & Rose, 2010; Kokkelenberg & Sinha,
2010). Improving math learning in the elementary grades is important to ensure children have
the essential foundational skills and strong self-efficacy beliefs to be able to succeed with later
mathematics and pursue careers in STEM. With this Fast-Track grant, we propose to build a
mathematical problem-solving environment, Teachley Problem Solving (TPS), to transform the
way elementary students learn to solve math problems. TPS will include a set of digital tools to
help students understand and classify the underlying structure of problems, use clear visuals to
model the mathematics of the problems, and construct strong mathematical arguments. The
environment will also integrate into ASSISTments, a math curriculum platform built by The
ASSISTments Foundation and Wooster Polytechnic Institute .
 Outcomes. The proposal will encourage two main outcomes, namely: 1) improved
student math achievement and 2) increased math self-efficacy. A key research aim is to
determine whether supporting elementary students with digital problem-solving tools helps them
develop stronger problem-solving skills as compared to typical instruction. We also anticipate
that using the engaging tools with real-time feedback will also bolster students’ motivation and
self-efficacy in mathematics.
 Improving students’ academic outcomes and math self-efficacy during elementary school
will promote later success in high school mathematics. Since the number of advanced math
classes students take is correlated with likelihood to complete a STEM degree, (Chen, 2013) a
distal outcome of this proposal is increasing the number of students pursuing careers in STEM.

A diverse scientific workforce is essential to fostering scientific innovation and excellence and
providing safe and quality learning and work environments. Despite extensive efforts and some
noteworthy progress, certain groups' underrepresentation remains a concern for the health-
related scientific workforce. Undergraduate research experiences, such as summer research
programs, have been shown to increase learning skills, career ambitions, completion of a STEM
degree, and advancement to a graduate program for undergraduate students, particularly those
from underrepresented groups in science. In response to
PAR-21-168
"Summer Research
Education Experience Program (R25)", we propose the Syracuse University-Summer Training in
Alcohol Research (SU-STAR) program. The SU-STAR program aims to (1) recruit an annual
cohort of
five to seven undergraduate students from underrepresented groups
in science across
the nation who demonstrate academic potential as well as strong interests in alcohol and health
research and in advancing to a graduate school in related disciplines; (2) provide participants
with the opportunity to participate in a rigorous eight-week research internship and enrichment
activities, (3) conduct
ongoing evaluations during the summer program and bi-annual follow-ups
regarding the program's success in participant recruitment, retention, and educational and
career outcomes; and (4) disseminate program information and materials to the undergraduate
student body, academic units, and scientific community. Ultimately, this program will expand a
pipeline of diverse individuals in health research, which will enhance the science workforce's
inclusion and strengthen alcohol science by incorporating diverse perspectives and life
experiences.

Developed, together with Drs. Jenny Libien, MD, Ph.D., and Juan Marcos Alarcon, Ph.D., the Research Experience in Autism for College and High School students (REACH) summer program, provides underrepresented college students an advantage in pursuing a career in the biomedical fields. The REACH course is a research centric program with supplementary modules aimed at enhancing the participants’ knowledge of neurological disorders with emphasis in Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) through comprehensive lectures and clinical experiences. Students also receive instruction in career development with emphasis in mental health disparities and cultural competence. These experiences will inform the student-generated hypotheses and project that the students will develop throughout the summer. The program recruits basic science investigators, physicians, clinicians and graduate (PhD and medical students) students as REACH mentors. Utilizing team-based and peer-mentoring strategies, the student participants with the aid of their dedicated faculty and graduate student mentors will develop research hypotheses regarding ASD that they will experimentally resolve by the conclusion of the 8-week program. By exposing the participants to a diverse population of mentors, we hope to impress upon them the path and attainability of a life in the neuroscience and biomedical fields. Our program’s long-term goal is twofold, first to increase access and retention of underrepresented minorities into the neuroscience/biomedical field. Second, to positively impact underrepresented communities through our students.

Social connections are critical to human well-being, and people lacking in these connections (social isolation)
or who perceive that they are lacking these connections (loneliness) have lower self-management of chronic
disease, are more likely to suffer from substance abuse disorders and depression, and are at higher risk for
premature mortality. People living with HIV report a significant burden of loneliness and other indicators of
impaired social connectedness; these impaired social connections have been linked to reduced HIV adherence
and quality of life. The significant strain imposed on social relationships by COVID-19 restrictions and by
losses of family, friends, and community has brought urgency to the issue of social connections, particularly for
vulnerable populations such as those living with HIV infection. COVID-19 has also brought increased calls for
implementation of interventions focused on social connections, which in turn has highlighted a critical lack of
effective interventions in this area, rooted in evidence gaps regarding relationships between social connection
and health outcomes in diverse populations, in understanding of the unique and synergistic influences of
conceptually distinct dimensions of social connection on health over time, and on modifiable pathways linking
these connections to health outcomes. Applying a longitudinal, mixed-methods, and community-engaged
framework within a nationally-representative and well-characterized HIV cohort study, the MACS/WIHS
Combined Cohort Study (MWCCS), this project aims to: (Aim 1) characterize longitudinal and multidimensional
patterns of social connection both prior to and during the COVID-era, and identify social, behavioral and
genomic predictors of these patterns; (Aim 2) identify relationships between patterns of social connection and
HIV outcomes, including identification of mechanistic pathways via substance use disorders and depression,
and (Aim 3) assess multilevel mediators and moderators of relationships between social connection and
temporally associated outcomes including area-level socio-geographic indicators of poverty and population
density. This work utilizes the extensive platform of the MWCCS, including annual laboratory evaluation of HIV
disease indices, validated medication adherence measures, genome-wide data that will be utilized to construct
polygenic risk scores, annually updated geocoded data, and diagnostic assessments of substance use
disorders and depression (N=2000). To this, we will add an annual battery of social connection measures,
including social and emotional loneliness, social isolation, and social integration at selected MWCCS sites
(N=735), coupled with nested, longitudinal qualitative interviews (N=40). This multidimensional, longitudinal
and multilevel analysis will significantly extend previous research in this area, and findings from this project can
be utilized to identify actionable targets to support the design of effective interventions in this important area
and high priority population.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Project summary
Large datasets generated by hospitals could have a transformative effect on medical knowledge and patient
care. Yet currently the volume of data is more likely to overwhelm clinicians and the challenges of the data can
overwhelm machine learning algorithms. Intensive care units (ICUs) generate data at a resolution of seconds,
for the entirety of a patient's stay. Our long-term goal is to turn these data into actionable knowledge, like risk
factors for a disease, early intervention targets, and real-time information to support clinical decisions. This is
a broad problem, but particularly important in ICUs, which involve high stakes decisions being made in a
complex environment under time pressure. We focus in particular on understanding consciousness in adults,
and neurologic status in neonates. While 7% of ICU admissions are due to loss of consciousness, and degree of
consciousness is critical to evaluating prognosis, making difficult choices such as when to withdraw care, and
providing early interventions to improve quality of life, there are no objective or automated assessments for
consciousness (adults) or neurologic status (neonates). We have shown that unresponsive patients with brain
activation were twice as likely to regain the ability to follow commands compared to unresponsive patients
without such activation, yet these assessments are too time consuming for regular clinical use. However we also
showed that physiological data routinely collected in ICUs can be used as a proxy to classify consciousness. It is
still not known why it changes and we must be sure that the patterns we find are in fact causal to avoid treating
symptoms instead of a disease or launching unsuccessful clinical trials. There have been two key barriers
preventing a causal understanding of consciousness. First, variables measured for each ICU patient differ, and
can differ within a patient over the course of their admission. This leads to confounding when attempting to
infer causal models, and has prevented learning a single model for all patients, which limits generalizability.
Second, while the challenges of medical data require new methods, researchers are rarely able to rigorously
evaluate and compare them, since real-world data lacks ground truth and often cannot be shared for privacy
reasons. To address these challenges, we aim 1) to develop methods that learn generalizable causal models with
latent variables (by intelligently sharing and combining information across patients), 2) to develop data driven
simulations methods for testing machine learning algorithms while preserving privacy, and 3) to apply these
methods to neonatal and neurological ICU data. We aim to create better indicators for consciousness and to
uncover causes of both neurological status in ICU and its link to long-term functional outcomes. Our work
turns potential weaknesses of medical data (different variables measured across individuals) into a strength,
and will enable better use of large-scale observational biomedical data for real-time treatment decisions.

Large-scale genetic studies of major depression (MD) are primarily comprised of European descent cohorts.
Broadening diversity of study populations will empower genomic research by expanding discovery and
enhancing our understanding of the role of human genomic variation in disease etiology. This proposal
supports the formation of the Cross-Population Working Group on Genes and Environment in Major
Depression (POP-GEM) with the goal of characterizing genomic variants associated with MD across
ancestries. The overarching goal of this proposal is to leverage large-scale global collaborations to assemble
extant and emerging datasets from diverse ancestries in order to perform the largest and most inclusive cross-
population GWAS of MD to date (>70,000 diverse ancestry cases Phase I and >200,000 diverse ancestry
cases Phase II). We will delineate the genetic architecture of MD across populations, facilitating fine-mapping
of causal variants, improved polygenic risk profiling for all, examination of sex differences, and assessing
direction of causation between major comorbid traits and disorders. This application presents an exceptional
opportunity to gain insight into the etiology of MD and comorbid disease in groups underrepresented in prior
genetics research. Our broad goal is to address the major limitations in our knowledge of the genetic and
environmental risk architecture of MD in persons of diverse ancestries and lead to improvement in etiologic
understanding, diagnosis, prevention, and treatment in all populations.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Surfactant insufficiency compromises pulmonary compliance and respiratory function in multiple pulmonary
pathologies. Our understanding of surfactant metabolism in adult pulmonary disease is very limited and this
restricts the potential for therapeutic targeting. In this project, we have generated a new genetic model of
surfactant insufficiency in adult disease by deleting the low-density lipoprotein receptor related protein 1 (LRP1)
specifically in surfactant producing type 2 cells (AEC2). LRP1 functions as lipoprotein receptor and extracellular
protease clearing receptor and it is associated with decreased respiratory function in patients with COPD and
pulmonary arterial hypertension. Studies in our generated cell line of LRP1 knockdown AEC2 (LRP1 KD) and
tamoxifen-inducible AEC2-specific LRP1 knockout mice (SPC-LRP1-/-) show that LRP1 is required to maintain
surfactant lipid secretion and intracellular lipid homeostasis to ensure optimal pulmonary compliance and
respiratory function. We hypothesize that LRP1 controls surfactant metabolism in AEC2 and we will study the
regulatory mechanisms. In Aim 1 we will decipher the mechanism of action of LRP1 at the membrane level in
AEC2 and its regulation of the lipid source for surfactant synthesis in AEC2. In Aim 2 we will investigate the
epithelial to mesenchymal cross talk and the role of LRP1 in the progressive decline in lung function during
profibrotic challenges and molecular mechanisms responsible. We will attempt a new therapeutic approach to
stop the decline.
 This proposal is innovative conceptually and technically. The role of AEC2 lipid metabolism during adult
pulmonary disease is unknown. LRP1 regulates many cellular functions through lipid metabolism in different
tissues and our study shows that it also regulates pulmonary function through surfactant lipid metabolism. In
addition, we use novel techniques that include inducible and cell-specific genetic knockout models in vivo lipid
tracing and -omics analysis. Surfactant homeostasis enables basic pulmonary function, but the regulation of
surfactant homeostasis in adult disease is very little understood. The significance of this research is further
underscored by the fact that surfactant lipid is altered in multiple pulmonary pathologies, including the most
prevalent ones.

The ability of experimentalists to investigate biological systems has often been limited to pre-programmed
open-loop protocols whereby systems are probed based on assumptions and predetermined models. In
contrast, real-time feedback control allows systems to be dynamically probed with parameter perturbations
calculated as functions of instantaneous closed-loop system measurements, enabling researchers to
address questions not amenable to open-loop approaches. While there are many biological problems that
can be made more tractable by such feedback control – such as dynamic probing of ion-channel function in
neurons or manipulation of sleep network dynamics using auditory and electrical stimuli governed by real-
time EEG feedback – technical complexities often hinder its adoption.
Because there has been a many-decades advance in computing technologies, it is counter-intuitive that
real-time experiment control is not possible with standard computer operating systems (without expensive
add-on components). They are simply not designed for such strictly timed tasks. Furthermore, commercial
real-time systems are costly and require end-user customization for the lab, such that they are typically not
portable to the broader scientific community. To circumvent these limitations, we developed a fast and
highly versatile real-time biological experimentation system – the Real-Time eXperiment Interface (RTXI).
RTXI is free and open source, compatible with an extensive range of experimentation hardware, and
delivers reproducible, hard real-time performance via a user-tailorable interface on standard laboratory
computers. Importantly, RTXI offers extensive versatility and high-performance to “power users,” while
simultaneously providing a rich – and ever growing – library of experiment-control modules that require little
effort for those who are not computationally savvy.
RTXI has grown to the point where it is now an invaluable part of the scientific programs of many leading
research groups. In addition to updating and maintaining RTXI for those, and future, users, there remain
important avenues for development that would substantially expand RTXI’s functionality, reproducibility
enhancement, and utility for an even broader group of biological researchers. Thus, we propose:
1. To keep RTXI pushing scientific innovation by overhauling its base code and core modules.
2. To enable several new real-time experiment paradigms.
3. To ease and enrich experimentalists’ user experience and reproducibility.
Critically, the work proposed here will ensure that RTXI remains a valuable research tool for its varied
group of outstanding biological scientist end users. Furthermore, we will expand RTXI’s utility significantly
by building and supporting additional classes of experiments and the groundbreaking science they will
enable.

Research (PRIDE-CVD) formerly known as SIPID (Summer Institute Program to Increase Diversity) at the
State University of New York Downstate Health Sciences University (Downstate) in Brooklyn, New York. The
goal of the SIPID/PRIDE-CVD is to nurture and instruct underrepresented scientists/clinicians in
multidisciplinary approaches to research in cardiovascular health disparities using Brooklyn as a living
laboratory. The SIPID/PRIDE-CVD has been in existence for 17 years and has trained 129 mentees from 103
Universities nationwide. As a result of this training, 68.4% and 78% of the SIPID/PRIDE-CVD mentees,
secured peer-reviewed grants, 74% and 46% were promoted and their publications increased by 13-fold and
4.6-fold since graduation, respectively. To continue to build on this success and years of experience, this
renewal has the following Specific Aims:
1: Select and train qualified underrepresented scientists/clinicians with potential to contribute to the
knowledge in cardiovascular health disparities research
2: Provide long-term tailored one-to-one and peer mentoring with the goal to submit a research grant
application
3: Provide intensive individualized training and guidance in grant writing and peer review to enhance
the capacity for success in research careers
4: Provide financial support for small research projects to facilitate transition to independence
5: Evaluate long-term effectiveness of PRIDE-CVD
The renewal of PRIDE-CVD at Downstate is characterized by: 1) Its partnership with minority-led community-
based organizations with expertise in health disparities; 2) The living laboratory of Brooklyn, New York, an
urban setting in which to conduct health disparities and CVD research; 3) A well renown faculty roster with a
high number of minority members; 4) A historical context providing 17 years of experience in training,
mentoring and supporting underrepresented junior faculty. It is expected that the PRIDE-CVD will continue to
contribute significantly to improving the pool of highly-capable underrepresented professionals in
cardiovascular health research and creating a sense of community among mentees, an important aspect as
they continue to grow in their career paths. The ultimate goal in increasing diversity among the ranks of
underrepresented scientists/clinicians is an important step towards alleviating health disparities in CVD.

Biomolecular condensates are dynamic, membraneless compartments that spatiotemporally regulate a
myriad of cellular functions from gene transcription to cellular stress response. Liquid-liquid phase
separation (LLPS) is increasingly appreciated as the biophysical mechanism for how these condensates
assemble. Key to proper condensate function is the maintenance of their dynamics and
assembly/disassembly processes, but little is known about these mechanisms. Hints are provided from
disease states whereby condensates may undergo liquid-to-solid transitions into cytoplasmic inclusions
that contain protein quality control components and are characteristic of proteinopathies such as
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. We have identified UBQLN2, a member of ubiquitin-mediated protein
quality control systems, as a contributor to condensate function. We recently showed that UBQLN2 forms
condensates in vitro, and is recruited to stress granules, cytoplasmic condensates that form in response
to stress. The multitude of UBQLN2 functions are driven through interactions with proteasomal subunits,
polyubiquitin chains, and client proteins. Ubiquitin and polyubiquitin, biological signals for the
maintenance of protein homeostasis through degradation and autophagy, drive disassembly of UBQLN2
condensates in vitro. These observations have broad implications for how phase separation mechanisms
regulate the function of protein quality control systems. In this project, we aim to identify the molecular
and cellular mechanisms that drive how UBQLN2 condensates assemble and disassemble. Aim 1
determines how domain-domain interactions promote or inhibit phase separation of UBQLN2 via
construction of phase diagrams for constructs from a combination of UBQLN2 domain deletion and
disease-linked mutations. These domain deletions will be used to mimic the different “states” of UBQLN2
when specific domains are engaged with binding partners and unable to contribute to LLPS. We will use
UBQLN2 disease-linked mutations as a nature-provided library to elucidate how intra- and intermolecular
UBQLN2 interactions promote or inhibit condensate assembly and alter condensate morphology and
material properties both in vitro and in mammalian cell culture models. Aim 2 quantifies how UBQLN2
condensates are affected by UBQLN2 engagement with protein quality control components, including
proteasomal receptors, client proteins, and different types of polyubiquitin chains. We monitor these
effects in vitro and with designed mutants in vivo. Importantly, we develop a reconstituted UBQLN2
condensate model to quantify the parameters of how polyubiquitin and polyubiquitinated substrates
engage with UBQLN2 to disassemble condensates. These studies will lay the foundation for determining
the physiological roles of phase separation as it pertains to protein homeostasis through ubiquitin-
mediated pathways.

play an important role in cardiac left-right development. Evidence from model organisms, such as in zebrafish
organ of asymmetry, (Kupffer’s Vesicle, KV) indicates that conserved cilia-driven leftward flow establishes left-
right signals to regulate target genes to control asymmetric heart morphogenesis. While events downstream of
leftward flow have received much attention, little is known about how the organ of asymmetry is formed and the
biology of the ciliated cells that generate fluid flow. This project addresses the broad question: How do ciliated
cells develop into a functional polarized organ? To address this question we are bringing together cell biology
and developmental biology to investigate how the cytokinetic bridge establishes apical polarity and a lumen in
vivo. We propose that this occurs through a sequential process that starts with cell division and placement of
the cytokinetic midbody, which marks a site for where the apical membrane should be placed. Cytokinetic
bridge resolution (a.k.a. abscission) results in the separation of two daughter cells following mitosis allowing for
the cell to initiate ciliogenesis. This process has important implications in embryogenesis, and broad
implications in the role of cytokinesis in developing cellular diversity. While abscission has been examined in
vitro, little has been done to examine the role of cytokinesis/abscission in epithelial establishment and de novo
lumen formation in vivo. Thus, our work will test the overall hypothesis that cell division is an essential
process that initiates lumen formation, ciliogenesis, and subsequently tissue morphogenesis. Here we propose
to examine in the zebrafish KV a requirement for abscission in the transition of progenitor-mesenchymal-like
migratory cells to epithelial-ciliated cells (tested in Aim 1). For instance, does cell division trigger KV-specific
apical polarity protein expression and does division contribute to how cells are patterned to form a KV? We
propose that following cytokinesis, daughter cells stay interconnected by a cytokinetic bridge while apical
polarity is established. This process requires targeted membrane traffic into the cytokinetic bridge. During this
time, the two daughter cells position themselves so that the cytokinetic bridge is placed where an apical
membrane and lumen will form. Once the bridge is cleaved, a lumen is initiated (Aim 2) and KV cells can form
primary cilia (Aim 3). We will use photoconversion to track cell fate following division, and laser ablation or
optogenetics to determine whether abscission timing is important for apical polarity, cilia formation, and
lumenogenesis. These studies will identify important mechanisms for de novo tissue morphogenesis.

Protein detection and biomarker profiling have wide-ranging significance in many areas of disease prognostics,
diagnostics, and therapeutics. For example, the progression and development of various cancers are
accompanied by alterations in specific protein expressions. These variations in different biofluids are indicative
of disease-like conditions. A long-standing difficulty of existing methods is the detection of multiple proteins in a
complex biological sample with high sensitivity and a broad dynamic range. In addition, scalable protein
identification and quantification techniques are usually created with sacrificed sensitivity, so their applicability in
clinical settings remains limited. To overcome these fundamental and technical shortcomings, we will develop,
optimize, and validate a next-generation class of sensing elements for targeted protein biomarker detection at
single-recognition event precision. These proposed studies aim to engineer synthetic sensors made of a
single-polypeptide chain protein nanostructure. This protein nanostructure encompasses a membrane protein
pore and a programmable protein binder. The protein pore is a reporter that generates an output signature,
which depends on the identity and quantity of the biomarker. A programmable binder is a small antibody-
mimetic scaffold, such as a monobody or an affibody, sampling the targeted biomarker in solution. Hence, a
generic binder can be modified for multiple protein analytes. This way, such a modular design significantly
expands the utility of these sensing elements for numerous biomarkers while preserving their high sensitivity
and specificity using the resistive-pulse technique. This critical benefit is facilitated by the genetically encoded
nature of these sensors so that they can form combinatorial libraries of tethered binders. These manipulations
of modular pore-based detectors equipped with antibody-mimetic binders have not been conducted previously.
They are intended for use in challenging biofluids, where specific binder-biomarker interactions will be
unambiguously distinguished from nonspecific interactions of the medium constituents. Further advantages of
this real-time and label-free technology include maintaining an amplified signal-to-noise ratio in a wide dynamic
range due to the superior bandwidth of time-resolved electrical recordings. The expected immediate outcomes
of these proposed studies will be the following: (i) development, optimization, and validation of monobody- and
affibody-based sensors for protein detection; (ii) protein biomarker detection in multiplexed and high-
throughput formulations; (iii) protein biomarker detection in heterogeneous solutions. These results will
represent a platform for fingerprinting panels of multiple protein targets in biofluids without impairing the
sensitivity of these determinations. This proposed research will impact quantitative proteomics and biosensor
technology by providing a fundamental basis and tools for ultrasensitive biomarker detection.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Catheter associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) is one of the most common healthcare-associated
infections (HAIs), with a prevalence of 13 – 15% in the United States. CAUTIs are also blamed for
increased morbidity and mortality of affected patients with an estimated 13,000 deaths annually. It is
well known that the abiotic catheter materials are prone to colonization of microbes, which then ascend
the catheter via motility and biofilm formation, causing infections in the urinary tract. Due to the protection
of the biofilm matrix and slow growth of attached cells, biofilm cells are up to 1,000 times more resistant
to antimicrobials than the planktonic cells of the same species. Thus, CAUTIs are difficult to treat and
blockage of the catheter lumen can occur especially during long-term use, leading to stone formation
and infections of the bladder and even kidney. Treatment of CAUTIs with high doses of antimicrobial
agents can also adversely promote the development of multidrug resistant bacteria. Despite extensive
research to date, no current technology can provide long-term (>30 days) fouling control. This unmet
challenge motivated us to engineer smart catheters to ultimately eradicate CAUTI.
Recently, the PI’s lab developed a new antifouling strategy based on active topography that drives
magnetically responsive micron-size pillars to beat with a tunable frequency and force level. This was
achieved by loading Fe3O4 nanoparticles on the tip of each pillar and generating an electromagnetic
field using an insulated copper coil embedded in the catheter wall (thus does not change the catheter
profile). This novel design demonstrated unprecedented strong antifouling activities that can inhibit
biofilm formation of multiple species by up to 3.6 logs (99.98%) for 48 hours and remove mature biofilms
by up to 3.5 logs (99.97%) on demand with a stronger force, compared to the flat control. A prototype
catheter with micron-size pillars on the inner wall was engineered and remained clean for more than 30
days under the flow of artificial urine and the challenge of uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC), while
both flat and static controls were completely blocked by UPEC biofilms within 5 days. These results
motivated the team to further develop this technology to also control biofouling of the outer catheter wall,
which is covered by urethral mucosa and involved in two thirds of CAUTIs. Integrated simulation and
experimental studies will be conducted to understand the mechanism of biofouling control by active
topography and the design principles for antifouling topographies on both sides of the catheter wall. The
best design will be further tested in vivo using a rabbit model of CAUTI induced by UPEC. Both CAUTI
prevention (up to 30 days) and removal of established biofilms will be evaluated.

L-DOPA remains the gold-standard treatment for Parkinson’s disease (PD). Unfortunately, within a decade of
commencing L-DOPA, nearly 90% of PD patients develop intractable abnormal involuntary movements known as L-
DOPA-induced dyskinesias (LID), severely impacting quality of life. Research implicates serotonin (5-HT) neurons
as a source of LID as they can take up L-DOPA, convert it to dopamine (DA), and release DA as an unregulated
“false neurotransmitter” leading to a dyskinesogenic phenotype. Although treatments aimed at alleviating LID have
emerged, only a minority of patients benefit due to their cost, side effects and/or invasiveness. Moreover, we
have yet to find a way to prevent LID development, in part due to major gaps in knowledge on how L-DOPA
treatment instigates maladaptive 5-HT reorganization and aberrant striatal output. Our research team has
recently collected preliminary data using novel approaches that provide exciting new insights into the
mechanisms of 5-HT neuroplasticity that will enlighten both basic and clinical science. These convergent findings
led us to postulate our Central Hypothesis that maladaptive 5-HT-raphe-striatal neurocircuit plasticity
precipitates and maintains LID. The overarching goal for our multi-investigator team is to identify the mechanisms
underlying the development of structural and functional maladaptation within the raphe-striatal circuit driving LID,
which in turn could lead to novel, optimized targets for intervention. We will fill this knowledge gap through the
pursuit of 3 independent, but inter-related Specific Aims. Our 3 Specific Aims will: 1) define the extent to which
DA denervation and/or L-DOPA treatment results in anatomical and functional reorganization of the 5-HT raphe-
striatal pathway in PD and experimental parkinsonism, 2) use projection-specific chemogenetic modulations to
determine the impact of the 5-HT raphe-striatal activity on L-DOPA-induced anti-parkinsonian efficacy and
dyskinesia, and 3) establish how regulating DA release from 5-HT raphe-striatal neurons prevents the
development of LID and associated maladaptive neuronal changes. The proposed cross-species investigation will
establish neuroplasticity within the 5-HT raphe-striatal circuit as a foremost factor in the development and expression
of LID and in so doing, identify optimal treatment strategies to improve the quality of life for millions of current and
prospective PD patients.

 Cardiometabolic (CM) diseases including cardiovascular (CV) and metabolic diseases are the leading
cause of preventable death in the United States and Worldwide. CM diseases are interconnected and positively
associated with multi-domain Cardiometabolic Risk Factors (CMRFs) such as metabolic dysregulation, obesity,
physical inactivity, poor nutrition, and other emerging factors (including and especially sleep disorders). CMRFs
are highly and increasingly prevalent in adolescents and young adults, which foreshadows a future
epidemic of incident CM diseases as they age. However, existing studies have primarily focused on the adult
and senior population with little to no knowledge on the young population.
CM data hold great promise to facilitate CM subgroup discovery for early risk stratification and precise
prognosis. However, significant gaps exist in fully leveraging CM data. Gap I: Lack of inclusion of multi-
domain CMRFs (especially sleep health). Gap II: Lack of “outcome-predictive” CM subgroups in early risk
stratification. Gap III: Lack of “subgroup-specific” precise prognosis of “multi-dimensional” CM outcomes. Gap
IV: Under-utilization of the rich but “incomplete” multi-domain CM data in NHANES and NSRR. We propose a
multi-study multi-domain secondary analysis for CM subgroup discovery and risk prediction in U.S. adolescents
(11-18) and young adults (19-39). The objective is to create 2 combined NHANES and NSRR datasets and
examine multi-domain CMRFs including metabolic dysregulation, physical inactivity, poor nutrition, and multi-
dimensional sleep measures for CM subgroup discovery and risk prediction in the large and diverse U.S.
adolescent and young adult population of Hispanics/Latinos, African Americans, Caucasians, and Asian
Americans. Aim 1. CM risk subgroup discovery at baseline for U.S. adolescents & young adults. (1.1) Develop
a novel sparse Incomplete Multi-domain Mixed-typed Factor Mixture Model (IM2-FMM) for subgroup discovery
from incomplete multi-domain mixed-typed CMRFs. (1.2) Apply IM2-FMM to identify, characterize, and evaluate
CM subgroups in adolescents and young adults from incomplete multi-domain mixed-typed CMRFs at baseline
including: (a) self-reported sleep measures in NHANES; (b) self-reported and objective sleep measures in NSRR.
Aim 2. Subgroup-specific prediction of multi-dimensional longitudinal CM outcomes for young adults. (2.1)
Develop a novel sparse Transfer Learning-based Generalized Multi-level Model (TL-GMM) to predict multi-
dimensional longitudinal CM outcomes from clustered CMRFs at baseline. (2.2) Apply TL-GMM to young adults
in NSRR to: (1) examine fixed effects and random effects of baseline CMRFs on CM outcomes; (2) provide
subgroup-specific multi-dimensional prognosis of CM health from clustered CMRFs at baseline. Impact: Our
study will generate novel insights into CM subgroup discovery to facilitate early and targeted interventions and
help establish health promoting behaviors in adolescents and young adults, eventually improving CM health care
in their transition to adulthood and reducing CM health disparities and costs as the young population ages.

The cell nucleus is bi-directionally transported and positioned in a cell cycle specific manner, a process that is
important for cell cycle control as well as brain and muscle development. The importance of nuclear positioning
for brain and muscle development is underscored by the fact that human disease mutations of proteins
engaged in the transport of the nucleus cause severe brain and muscle development diseases, including
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), hereditary spastic paraplegia and spinal muscular atrophy, which is the
most common genetic cause of death in infants. Yet, it is unknown how teams of opposing motor complexes
collaborate to achieve correct timing, directionality and velocity of transport. Notably, the interactions of
opposing motors with cargoes have not been characterized by biochemical or structural methods as proposed
here. The nuclear pore complex protein Nup358 provides recruitment sites at the nuclear envelope for the
opposing motor complexes dynein and kinesin-1, which can bind simultaneously and facilitate bi-directional
positioning of the nucleus along microtubules. This pathway is important for faithful chromosome segregation
and essential for a fundamental process in brain development that is required for brain progenitor cells to
differentiate to neurons and other cell types. Dynein adapters such as Bicaudal D2 (BicD2) have key roles in
transport, as they select cargoes and are required to activate dynein for processive motility; however, the
underlying molecular mechanism is unknown.
We plan: 1) To establish how dynein motility is modulated by dynein adapter/cargo complexes and by kinesin-
1. 2) to establish a structural basis for recognition of the cell nucleus as cargo by dynein adapters. 3) To
establish whether dynein and kinesin-1 are recruited in a cooperative manner to Nup358 at the nucleus, i.e.
whether binding of the first motor changes the affinity for the second motor. We plan to establish how
BicD2/cargo complexes activate dynein for processive motility. Furthermore we plan to assess how kinesin-1
modulates motility of the dynein/BicD2/Nup358 complex.
Our approach combines NMR spectroscopy, X-ray crystallography and biophysical methods, which are
integrated with single-molecule processivity assays with intact dynein and kinesin-1 motors. Results will
establish a structural basis for cargo selection by BicD2. Our study serves as a model system to understand
how cargo adapters regulate the motility and directionality of cargo transported bi-directionally by both dynein
and kinesin-1, which is important as these motors facilitate a vast number of cellular transport events that are
essential for chromosome segregation, signal transmission at synapses, brain and muscle development. More
specifically, results will establish how correctly timed bi-directional transport of the nucleus is regulated, which
is crucial for cell cycle control, muscle and brain development. Mutations of proteins of these pathways cause
devastating neuromuscular diseases, and results will help devise therapies for these diseases.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：After a tissue is infected, the invading pathogen must be controlled and the tissue must be repaired or
else long-term morbidity and mortality will ensue. Toxoplasma gondii infections result in a
non-resolving chronic infection with tissue cysts residing preferentially in skeletal muscle and the
central nervous system. In contrast to the brain little is known about the immune response and
immune-regulation in the infected muscle. Foxp3-expressing CD4+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) play a
key role in controlling the immune response to infection and aid in tissue repair. Yet, we have found
during chronic T. gondii infection muscle Tregs become pathogenic and cause inflammation instead
of preventing it. We have shown these Tregs are Th1-polarized but do not produce IFNγ. Tregs in T.
gondii-infected muscle produce low levels of amphiregulin, a cytokine critical in repairing
immune-mediated pathology. We showed that Toxoplasma-induced immunopathology in muscle can
be ameliorated by recombinant treatment with amphiregulin in chronically infected mice and returning
function to the tissue. However it is unclear how amphiregulin mediates this effect. The overarching
hypothesis for this proposal is that T-bet expression in skeletal muscle Tregs drives this pathogenic
function by dampening production of key factors associated with normally suppressive Treg function.
This hypothesis will be addressed in the following specific aims: (1) identify how T-bet drives the
pathogenic function of Tregs in infected muscle and (2) define the role of amphiregulin in infected
muscle during Toxoplasma infection. How a chronic infection alters the highly orchestrated
immune-mediated regeneration of muscle is still poorly understood. Loss of muscle mass predicts
reduced quality of life and often increased morbidity for chronically ill patients and so a better
understanding of what drives this process is needed for directing therapeutic interventions.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Uncontrolled Toxoplasma growth is the primary mechanism by which the parasite causes
severe and life-threatening disease. The parasite replicates by a process termed endodyogeny,
where two daughter parasites form within a single mother. A key step in endodyogeny is formation
of the daughter cell inner membrane complex, which is an unique organelle that lies directly
underneath the plasma membrane and is required for parasite motility and replication. During
daughter cell development, the nascent IMC emerges from a complex named the daughter cell
scaffold (DCS). Despite its importance, the DCS is poorly characterized and few of its constituent
proteins are known. Here, we hypothesize that the Toxoplasma F-box protein, TgFBXO1, is a
critical component of the DCS. To test our hypothesis, we will determine: i) how TgFBXO1 is
targeted to the DCS, ii) how TgFBXO1 regulates inner membrane complex development and
organization, and iii) which TgFBXO1-interacting proteins are important for inner membrane
complex development. Together, these studies will provide in depth mechanistic detail for a
protein complex that is critical for growth of an important protozoan pathogen. Furthermore, they
were serve as a springboard for future studies aimed at developing novel anti-parasitic drugs that
function by targeting this complex.

urgent public health threat in the US and around the globe. New Delhi Metallo-β-lactamases (NDM)
producing CRE are particularly concerning as they have rapidly spread worldwide and can efficiently co-
exist with a plethora of Gram-negative resistance determinants including Extended Spectrum β-lactamases
(ESBLs), carbapenemases, and polymyxin resistance genes. We have reported the first US case of
polymyxin- and carbapenem-resistant E. coli producing New Delhi Metallo-beta-lactamase (NDM-5)
together with mobile colistin resistance (MCR-1) in a patient. The recent report of pan-drug-resistant (PDR),
K. pneumoniae (NDM-1, ESBLs, and polymyxin resistance determinants), from a patient in Nevada further
highlights that it may be only a matter of time until hospitals in the US and worldwide face an outbreak of
these Gram-negative ‘superbugs’. It is critical to prepare therapeutics for the future occurrence of NDM
strains which harbor a diverse array of resistance determinants. Our Central Hypothesis is that rationally
optimized antibiotic combination dosing strategies will achieve extensive killing and prevent emergence of
resistance against of NDM-producing Enterobactericeae. Our preliminary studies provide compelling
evidence in support of our innovative combinations. We established the first highly efficient cassette assay
to assess target site penetration of β-lactams in the presence of polymyxins, the first dataset on β-lactam
receptor binding in K. pneumoniae, and show that new 4-drug combination regimens eradicated NDM and
ESBL co-producing K. pneumoniae and prevented resistance. In Aim 1, we will create genetically
engineered strains, as well as assess the target site penetration and receptor binding of β-lactam antibiotics
and β-lactamase inhibitors, and the enhanced penetration in presence of polymyxins. In Aim 2, in vitro
pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics models, including the dynamic Hollow Fiber Infection Model, will
evaluate optimized dosing strategies for 3- and 4-drug combinations by profiling the time course of bacterial
killing, suppression of resistance, and persister eradication. Genomics and transcriptomics will be utilized to
understand why monotherapies and non-optimized combinations failed with resistance. In Aim 3, our latest
Quantitative and Systems Pharmacology (QSP) modelling approach will guide translation across all
experimental tiers. Prospective validation of these novel optimal combination dosing strategies will be
completed in murine pneumonia models with an intact and impaired immune system. This will yield
innovative combination dosage regimens against pandrug-resistant CRE that can suppress resistance.
Thus, this project will address an urgent, global medical need. This project will provide the first
mechanistically informed, rationally optimized and prospectively validated combination dosing strategies of
available antibiotics against resistant Gram-negatives that will be ready for testing in future clinical trials.

In Alzheimer’s disease (AD) research, a big challenge is the identification and targeting of key molecules in
critical neural circuits that play a causal role in cognitive impairment at the early stage before global
neurodegeneration. We hypothesize that transcriptional downregulation of selective neuronal genes in early AD
initiates the loss of synaptic function in specific brain circuits, leading to cognitive decline. In Aim 1, we will identify
transcriptomic changes at the early stage of AD using human postmortem tissues and iPSC-derived cortical
neurons. Comprehensive bioinformatic analyses of large-scale bulk and single-cell RNAseq data from
postmortem human with ‘early-pathology’ and ‘late-pathology’ of AD will be performed to identify prominent
changes in gene networks, molecular pathways and biological processes at different stages. Given the limitation
of postmortem tissues in capturing early molecular alterations, we will also profile transcriptional changes using
human cortical neurons differentiated from iPSCs of sporadic AD patients. Based on our preliminary data, the
loss of selective presynaptic and postsynaptic genes involved in vesicle release and glutamatergic/GABAergic
transmission is the major early change in cortical neurons of AD patients. In Aim 2, we will identify
electrophysiological changes using AD mouse models and iPSC-derived cortical neurons from AD patients. We
will use in vivo multichannel recording of action potential spikes, optogenetic isolation of neural pathways and
ex vivo patch-clamp recording of synaptic currents in AD mouse models to obtain the high-resolution mapping
of cognitive circuits that go awry at various stages. In Aim 3, we will identify intervention strategies to rescue AD-
associated functional deficits in AD mouse models and iPSC-derived cortical neurons from AD patients. Guided
by the identified molecular and circuitry changes in AD, we will use viral-based approaches to normalize gene
expression or neuronal activity in specific circuits, and examine the impact on synaptic transmission and
cognitive behaviors in AD mouse models. This study will uncover transcriptomic and circuitry aberrations in early
stage of AD, and help to develop mechanism-based therapeutic strategies to mitigate synaptic deficits and
improve cognition.

Ventricular tachyarrhythmias are responsible for 300,000 sudden cardiac deaths a year in the US. The
mechanisms underlying these arrhythmias in the majority of cases are ventricular tachycardia (VT) and/or
ventricular fibrillation (VF). The ever-increasing prevalence of obesity also poses a significant burden on
the health care system with increased morbidity and mortality. Importantly, obesity has been associated
with cardiac arrhythmias with increased risk of sudden cardiac death linked to increased adiposity.
However, the mechanisms by which obesity could result in ventricular arrhythmias (VT/VF) remain
incompletely understood. In this proposal, I plan to use a multimodal and multiscale approach to
characterize VT/VF in donor human hearts associated with sustained obesity. In the mentored phase of
this project, I will use donor hearts to investigate the role of epicardial adiposity in promoting VT/VF via
paracrine signaling, while also getting specialized training in bioinformatics and adipocyte biology. In the
independent phase of this project, I will use donor hearts to investigate the role of epicardial adiposity in
generating arrhythmogenic triggers. The experiments outlined below will advance our understanding of
VT/VF mechanisms and also serve as proof-of-concept for future experiments designed to develop new
markers to predict and treat VT/VF vulnerability in a clinical setting.

KL2 Mentored Career Development Award. The CTSA-Linked KL2 mentored career development award
program (KL2 program) will strive to engage talented and motivated scholars to join the clinical and translational
science workforce with the goal of developing new diagnostic, preventive, and therapeutic interventions for
diseases, with an emphasis on addressing health disparities. The KL2 program has stimulated clinical and
translational research across the Buffalo Translational Consortium (BTC) by attracting, mentoring, training and
engaging scholars with diverse cultural, ethnic, racial and professional backgrounds and across scientific
disciplines (i.e. RN-PhDs, PharmDs, PhDs, MDs, and/or DDS-PhDs). These scholars receive an
interprofessional and interdisciplinary education where they learn with, about, and from each other, enabling
effective collaboration and discoveries in clinical and translational research. In the proposed funding period, the
KL2 program will train at least four junior faculty physician scientist scholars by supporting them for two years
on their path to independence, with the option of receiving an additional third year of institutional funding upon
completion of the program curriculum and objective evaluation of scholarly accomplishments. The program is
complemented by and integrated with the institutionally-funded BTC scholars program, allowing us to train five
(three in years 1-3; two in years 3-5) additional scholars under the same terms during the next funding period.
Integration of all scholars’ activities under our well-established mentoring and training program brings together
a critical mass of diverse professional experiences and talent benefiting all involved. The KL2 program has three
specific aims towards these goals are: 1) attract skilled and motivated early career clinical and translational
investigators from a broad range of health science disciplines, including individuals underrepresented in health
science; 2) provide comprehensive tailored support to mentor and train the scholars to promote pathways to
independence; and 3) engage scholars, facilitate interactions and enhance communications with the community
to raise awareness and accelerate solutions for health disparities. Innovations in our KL2 program include the
awarding of digital badges followed by micro-credentials, which are competency-based documentation of training
in specific areas; inclusion of community agency advisors and partners on scholars’ mentoring teams, aligning
with our goal to address health disparities in our community; and extensive partnering with other CTSA hubs.
The program will mentor, train and develop KL2 scholars’ professional skills and facilitate a seamless transition
to their next career level in the clinical and translational workforce. The overall goal of this KL2 program is to
develop the next generation of 21st century leaders whose backgrounds mirror the diversity of our community to
enhance excellence in clinical and translational research, locally and across the nation.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) are Gram-positive bacteria responsible for 1.6 million deaths
globally each year. Available pneumococcal vaccines have reduced efficacy in the elderly, and despite
vaccination, S. pneumoniae remain the leading cause of bacterial community-acquired pneumonia in adults over
the age of 65. This decline in vaccine efficacy is driven by immunosenescence, the age-associated decline in
immune function. Polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) are cells of the innate immune system and are required
for host defense against S. pneumoniae infection. PMNs isolated from aged hosts display a significant reduction
in pneumococcal killing when compared to PMNs from young hosts. This reduction in killing persists despite
opsonization of bacteria with specific anti-pneumococcal antibodies, however, the signaling pathways driving
this decline in PMN function and the role of PMNs in the age-related reduction in vaccine efficacy remain unclear.
One pathway that controls PMN antibacterial responses is the extracellular adenosine pathway but the role of
this pathway in vaccinated hosts and how it changes with age remain unexplored. This led to the hypothesis
that with age, there is a decline in intracellular bacterial killing following antibody mediated uptake of S.
pneumoniae, which is driven by changes in adenosine receptor signaling. This hypothesis will be tested using
two specific aims: 1) Identify why intracellular killing of S. pneumoniae is defective in PMNs from old mice and
2) Identify the role of adenosine receptor signaling in the age-driven decline in intracellular killing of S.
pneumoniae by PMNs. This project is significant as it will identify the mechanism of the age-related changes in
PMN function following antibody mediated uptake of S. pneumoniae. Additionally, PMNs are involved in host
defense against multiple pathogens, therefore this work may provide a potential therapeutic target to boost
overall vaccine protectiveness in aged hosts. The overall goal of this research training plan is to strengthen the
candidate’s knowledge in host-pathogen interactions, immunology, and immunosenescence. As well as to
advance technical skills in microscopy, signaling, and cell biology techniques. These aims and goals will be
accomplished with the guidance of the qualified mentoring team assembled by the candidate and will be aided
by the opportunities offered by the training environment at the University at Buffalo Jacobs School of Medicine
and Biomedical Sciences. These resources will provide the necessary training and support to complete the
proposed research and guide the candidate’s future career in academia.

Ministry of Health. The scientific focus for the D43 GID renewal will be major endemic or life threatening emerging
viral infectious diseases and chronic viral infections including an emphasis on arbovirus and vector research,
COVID-19, chronic viral infection and antiviral drug development. This is based on the continued need for
building the research workforce to address these areas while recognizing the ongoing impact of COVID-19. The
initial GID program was focused on establishing a new initiative at The UWI Mona Campus for pre-doctoral and
post-doctoral candidates with an interest in virology research. The GID program was highly successful as
measured by outcome metrics including recruitment, training goals achieved and scientific dissemination. The
GID recruited ten outstanding scientists of whom 70% are women. The prior GID program established a research
training metric (RTM) that was scored 1-10 and included criteria such as responsible conduct of research training,
external seminars, degree-required courses, research proposal/protocol, IRB/ethics compliance, a research
project plan, project budget, and scientific writing. An RTM score of 9-10 was achieved by 70% of the trainees.
The GID trainees contributed to 11 manuscripts. The renewal GID will train 10 new independent researchers (5
pre-doctoral, 5 post-doctoral) with expertise in one or more of the following areas: arbovirology, viral hepatitis,
chronic viral infection, antiviral drug development, bioinformatics, omics, and epidemiology. Our experienced
GID mentors will be complemented by new faculty mentors who will provide innovative laboratory research
opportunities in vector biology, primate research, omics, molecular diagnostics, flow cytometry and mass
spectrometry with a customized curriculum based on each trainee’s Individualized Development Plan (IDP) to
achieve a personalized Virology Research Skills Toolbox. Trainees will complete short-term, mentored training
in US-based laboratories directed by faculty mentors with extensive experience in virology, immunology, omics
and pharmacology research. The GID renewal will continue to address the important public health challenges
related to infectious diseases and build on the successes of the initial GID research training program in Jamaica.

lamivudine and dolutegravir, long-acting ARVs (e.g., cabotegravir, rilpivirine), new ARVs (e.g., lenacapavir,
islatravir) and HIV-1 broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNABs), clinical and translational research related to these
new therapeutic agents is needed to examine the optimal pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamics parameters that
will prevent transmission and/or sustain viral load suppression as well as safety in the context of co-morbidities.
Training of clinician-scientists and translational scientists will utilize the foundation that has been built by the prior
UB-UZ HIVRT and transition to the newly designed research training program. Specific Aims: 1) Provide a HIVRT
for pre-doctoral (5) and post-doctoral (5) trainees that increases the number of researchers with independent,
funded programs with a focus on HIV clinical pharmacology and therapeutics and regional public health priorities
including COVID-19, 2) Mentor HIVRT trainees in team science and that include others with expertise in
pharmaceutical bioanalysis, biomedical informatics, data sciences, genomics, and microbiome, 3) Foster
community support group engagement to participate in innovative research to study novel HIV clinical
pharmacology and therapeutics strategies for prevention and treatment and investigate long-acting
antiretrovirals and monoclonal antibodies and traditional medicines, and 4) Provide an HIVRT that fosters smart
academic-public-private partnerships aimed at addressing sustainable developmental goals. Trainees will have
intensive training at UB during which new knowledge and skills will allow formulation of a research project that
will be conducted under continued supervision for 18 months at UZ for a total of two years of training. The
program will build on our prior Fogarty International Center HIV Research Training program, and an earlier
AITRP. These research training programs provide the foundation for this D43 renewal that includes an
outstanding group of UZ and UB mentors who will provide mentoring and collaboration utilizing the HIV Clinical
Pharmacology and Therapeutics foundation that has been built for HIV clinical and translational research. The
curriculum will be organized and provided through an established Research and Education Training Core. The

The ability to move from one place to another and acquire different motor skills is critical for our survival. Many
human disorders including Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and Tourette syndrome, cause
abnormal motor behaviors. Identifying neural circuits that mediate locomotion and motor learning are therefore
crucial both in terms of basic science and understanding how their dysfunction in disease models may
contribute to motor defects. Parafascicular (PF) thalamus has extensive connectivity within the basal ganglia
motor system, and is involved in reversal learning as well as the initiation of movement sequences. Although
heterogeneity within PF thalamic neurons has been reported at the cellular level, the functional relevance of
distinct PF subpopulations in motor behaviors remains unknown. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that
PF thalamus contains distinct projection-specific subpopulations that mediate different motor processes.
During the K99 phase, using chemogenetic neuronal inhibition and in vivo calcium imaging, I will test the
hypothesis that the thalamostriatal (PF!dorsal striatum) pathway is mainly involved in locomotion whereas the
thalamosubthalamic (PF!subthalamic nucleus) pathway is mainly involved in motor learning. By comparing
inputs from motor cortex, globus pallidus, and substantia nigra to these PF subpopulations followed by
optogenetic circuit manipulations, I will identify PF subpopulation-specific inputs that are critical for their
behavioral contributions. During the R00 phase, using ex vivo electrophysiology, I will determine how these two
PF circuits are altered in a mouse model of Parkinson's disease, which will set the stage for the identification of
circuit-based manipulations that may rescue both locomotion and motor learning in this mouse model. To
further these rescue experiments, I will perform single cell RNA sequencing of the two PF subpopulations in
wild type mice to identify potential molecular targets capable of rescuing both motor phenotypes in Parkinson's
disease mice. Together, the proposed project will not only enhance our understanding regarding the role of
distinct PF circuits in motor functions, but also potentially indicate that targeting PF circuits may be sufficient to
rescue multiple motor phenotypes in neurodegenerative disease models. The proposed research and career
development plan will be conducted in the lab of Dr. Guoping Feng at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard,
which will prepare Dr. Dheeraj Roy to direct an innovative research program as an independent investigator
studying neural circuit mechanisms mediating normal and disease states.

 Dysfunction and death of neurons severely affect the quality of life, yet therapeutic options remain
limited. Recent studies demonstrated clinic potential to replace lost neurons, e.g., transplanting of hESC-
derived retinal cells improves disrupted visual acuity. However, research progress is hindered by limited
mechanistic understanding of how to program cells into mature states for proper neurite outgrowth. Neurons
undergo dramatic remodeling during development to become fully mature. This conserved process consists of
precisely regulated pruning and outgrowth of neurites, facilitated by accurate transcriptome dynamics. How
chromatin is organized to achieve the dynamic transcriptome during this process remains undefined. My long-
term goal is to study epigenetic mechanisms underlying neuronal maturation and promote their application
toward studies with clinic potential to improve life quality. This proposed project uses both Drosophila and
mouse as model systems to study insulator regulation of 3D chromatin organization during neuronal outgrowth.
CTCF is a conserved insulator protein that plays a central role in 3D chromatin organization. Shep is a
conserved RNA/DNA-binding protein that is essential for proper neuronal outgrowth. My preliminary data
indicate that Shep antagonizes CTCF insulator to promote neuronal outgrowth of fly. Here I am proposing
three aims to investigate epigenetic mechanisms underlying my preliminary findings: 1) Determine neuron-
specific Shep regulation of 3D chromatin organization at its target loci in fly. 2) Investigate neuron-specific
mechanisms by which Shep antagonizes CTCF insulator function in fly. 3) Elucidate Shep and CTCF function
in regulating morphological and physiological maturation of mouse neurons. This project will employ extensive
neuron-specific high throughput sequencing coupled with physiological assays to reveal molecular
mechanisms underlying neuronal remodeling in both fly and mouse. These data will provide novel insights into
epigenetic regulation of neuronal maturation and suggest compelling mechanisms for studies with medical and
clinic potential. My career goal is to create my independent research group, employing fly as an efficient tool to
reveal mechanisms that are subsequently tested in the mouse model. My mentor Dr. Elissa Lei's group has
long been studying insulator-mediated chromatin organization and gene expression. I will get extensive training
in epigenetics, including scientific knowledge and technical skills to generate sequencing libraries in the Lei
group. My co-mentor Dr. Jeff Diamond will provide essential training on mouse neuroscience and physiology.
My second co-mentor Dr. Victor Corces will provide both scientific advice on epigenetic studies and guidance
on career development once I establish my lab at a university. The K99/R00 award will assist me to achieve
my goals by providing essential resource and funding at my mentored-stage and my early independent phase.

This proposal is being submitted to support the transition of Dr. Dominguez-Lopez from mentored trainee to
an independent investigator in the neurobiology of drug addiction, specifically studying the dopamine
microcircuits controlling drug-seeking behavior. Dr. Dominguez-Lopez works under the mentorship of Dr.
Michael Beckstead at the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation (OMRF) investigating the role of
dopamine neurotransmission in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) in methamphetamine (METH) self-
administration behavior. Dr. Beckstead is a recognized expert in dopamine synaptic transmission in the fields
of addiction. Dr. Beckstead’s laboratory combines mouse models of drug self-administration with patch-clamp
electrophysiology and immunocytochemistry, providing a dynamic environment for Dr. Dominguez-Lopez to
become an experienced scientist. The submitted proposal incorporates scientific training in methodologies to
study mitochondrial metabolism, transcriptional analysis, bioinformatics and genetic labeling of active
neuronal populations. The applicant will be receiving training in educational methods, scientific writing, grant
preparation and other skills necessary to become an independent brain research scientist from an
underrepresented group. The proposed program includes mentoring interactions with Dr. Holly Van Remmen,
Dr. Willard Freeman, Dr. Linda Thompson, members of OMRF, and Dr. Rajeshwar Awatramani from
Northwestern University in Chicago. The short-term objective of this application is to enhance Dr. Dominguez-
Lopez’s knowledge of mitochondrial metabolism and single cell transcriptomics applied to dopaminergic
circuits. In the long-term, this will enable Dr. Dominguez-Lopez to secure protected time for training and
research activities, establish new collaborations, and pursue his novel independent research resulting in
competitive grant proposals. Preliminary data obtained by Dr. Dominguez-Lopez indicates that prolonged
METH self-administration in mice produces a decrease of dopamine neurons in the VTA, decreases dopamine
cell excitability, increases mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate and decreases levels of glutathione. These
observations are concurrent with increased drug-seeking behavior. This research proposal expands on those
findings to identify metabolic and molecular characteristics in dopamine circuits that provide resistance or
vulnerability to METH exposure. The central hypothesis is that a subpopulation of VTA dopamine neurons is
responsible for METH-seeking behavior, forming a microcircuit that is resistant to mitochondrial oxidative
stress induced by chronic METH exposure. The proposed aims are 1) Identification of VTA dopamine
microcircuits encoding METH-seeking behavior, and 2) Metabolic characteristics of VTA dopamine neurons
encoding METH-seeking behavior. Identification of the specific brain circuits responsible for METH addictive
properties is a first step to develop therapeutic strategies to help addicts recover from METH addiction.

The Buffalo Translational Consortium (BTC), which includes the University at Buffalo (UB) health sciences
schools, the major healthcare institutions in our region, four key research institutes and five influential community
partners, have embarked on a comprehensive strategic plan to build a strong foundation for clinical and
translational research in response to our community needs. Buffalo is the second most populous city in New
York State and has a rich cultural history. The proportion of underrepresented minorities in Buffalo in 2018 (50%)
parallels that projected for the US in 2050, making Buffalo a microcosm of what the US will look like in 30 years.
A similar proportion of our population experiences health disparities. The vision for our CTSA hub is to perform
innovative research across the translational spectrum to improve the health of our community and the nation.
We will develop, test and share novel approaches to engage difficult-to-engage populations and reduce health
disparities in our community, which represents a “population of the future”. Guided by our vision, the CTSA has
catalyzed a transformation of our environment since our CTSA was first funded in August 2015 with remarkable
growth in clinical and translational research. Further, in just the past year, the UB medical school has moved into
a spectacular new building and our clinical partner, Kaleida Health, the largest healthcare system in the region,
opened the new Oishei Children’s Hospital, both on the Buffalo Niagara Medical Campus and connected to the
Clinical and Translational Research Center devoted entirely to clinical and translational research that opened in
2012. This rapid and continuing trajectory of growth in healthcare and research in the region has resulted in a
new 21st century Academic Health Center with healthcare, medical education and clinical and translational
research on one campus in the heart of Buffalo, creating a foundation to enhance the impact of our CTSA even
further. While launching our CTSA, we have prioritized participation in the national consortium through hosting
and testing Innovation Labs as a team science tool, working with multiple hubs on initiatives to solve translational
research barriers and sharing tools that we have developed with the CTSA consortium, including novel health
informatics tools. Our CTSA has five ambitious but achievable aims, including: 1) Accelerate innovative
translational research with teams that engage communities, regional stakeholders and the national consortium;
2) Train an excellent, diverse workforce to advance translation of discoveries; 3) Enhance inclusion of special
populations across the lifespan and difficult-to-engage populations; 4) Streamline clinical research processes
focusing on quality and efficiency with emphasis on multisite studies; 5) Develop, test and share biomedical
informatics tools to integrate data from multiple sources to speed translation. Guided by our vision to perform
research to improve the health of our community and the nation, we will continue our momentum to expand
translational research, train our diverse workforce, streamline processes, engage our community, and actively
contribute to the national consortium.

Lower-income and minority groups face significant health disparities with respect to obesity, cancer, heart
disease and other diet-related chronic conditions. Poor diets, low in fruits and vegetables (F&V) and high in
saturated fat, sodium and sugar, contribute to many of the health problems faced by vulnerable groups. While
socioeconomic status and other individual level factors (i.e., food preferences, time and skills to prepare
healthy food, etc.) can lead to reduced F&V consumption, these must be viewed in an environmental context.
Compared with higher-income neighborhoods, lower-income and minority neighborhoods are less likely to
have stores that sell a variety of F&V and other healthy foods. And when stores are available, produce may
not be affordable, high quality or culturally appropriate. Farmers' markets and mobile produce markets (MM)
have become increasingly popular strategies to alleviate food access concerns in underserved communities.
However, it is unclear if these programs have the necessary components to have an appreciable impact on
diet. Our research team recently completed one of the first randomized controlled trials of a MM program called
the Veggie Van. Veggie Van was run in partnership with our team and a small non-profit organization in North
Carolina; it delivered boxes of fresh, locally grown produce and food-focused education to communities with
significant barriers to F&V consumption including availability, affordability, quality and knowledge. In this small
cluster-randomized trial in 12 communities (N=201), we saw impressive changes in F&V intake with
intervention participants eating almost 1 more cups per day of F&Vs than the control group. Intervention
participants also reported increases in perceived access to healthy foods and Veggie Van customers attributed
many dietary changes to the MM program. While these results are very promising, we believe it is important to
test the effectiveness of the Veggie Van program when implemented by different organizations in multiple
communities. If shown to be effective, we can create a research-tested intervention toolkit which can be
disseminated to communities across the country. For this research, we will use a request for proposals
process to identify 8 organizations nationwide that are well-qualified to implement the Veggie Van model.
Organizations will identify appropriate sites for MM deliveries (32 total) and we will randomize them to either an
implementation or planning condition. With the help of our team's technical assistance and provided funding,
partner organizations will engage community members in the process and initiate a MM program. We will use
a Type 1 Hybrid Effectiveness-Implementation to measure effectiveness (diet, BMI, dermal carotenoids) and
implementation (customer reach and sales, process measures, qualitative interviews with MM staff). We will
also examine sustainability of MM financial models and determine implementation standards (i.e., dose needed
to maintain impact) for inclusion in our MM toolkit for future dissemination.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：This project will characterize the functional properties of NMDA receptors that lack N-terminal and C-terminal
domains, herein referred to as minimal receptors. These proteins consist of the core machinery of NMDA
receptors and include the extracellular agonist-binding domain (ABD) connected to the ion-permeable pore
formed by the transmembrane (TMD) domain. In the parent project, we were successful in using a structural
model of this minimal receptor to envision the opening trajectory of NMDA receptors, using molecular dynamics
simulations. However, it is unknown whether the minimal receptors are functional and therefore whether they
represent a suitable model for further structure-function investigations, based on the hypotheses generated by
our simulations. In this application, we propose to investigate the hypothesis that minimal NMDA receptors
display glutamate-mediated ionotropy. Our preliminary results demonstrate that minimal receptors respond to
glutamate by producing excitatory currents that differ in kinetics from wild-type receptors. By delineating
commonalities and differences between the activation mechanism of minimal NMDA receptors and native
receptors, results from this project will provide information necessary for the correct interpretation of results
from molecular dynamics simulations.

Post-translational modification of N-terminal α-amino groups is a highly conserved and vastly utilized process
seen in all species from bacteria to mammals. Dr. Schaner Tooley pioneered the field of N-terminal
methylation by identifying the first two eukaryotic N-terminal methyltransferases, NRMT1 and NRMT2. She
went on to characterize the consensus sequence of these enzymes, identify dozens of their substrates, and
show N-terminal methylation regulates protein/DNA interactions. Her lab was also the first to show that, like
histone PTMs, Nα-PTMs are part of a functional code. They identified the first protein known to exist in both
Nα-acetyl and Nα-methyl forms, Myosin Light Chain 9 (MYL9). They demonstrated that these two Nα-PTMs
create distinct proteoforms of MYL9, with unique protein binding partners, internal PTM patterns, and cell
compartment-specific functions. They have also demonstrated important roles for NRMT1 in oncogenesis
and aging. NRMT1 loss in breast cancer cells promotes proliferation, migration, colony formation, and
xenograph growth. NRMT1 knockout in mice promotes phenotypes associated with premature aging,
including early graying, kyphosis, and dermal fibrosis. They now want to expand understanding of the
biochemistry of NRMT1 regulation, identify additional substrates regulated by the Nα-PTM code, and
mechanistically characterize a newly discovered role for NRMT1 in stem cell fate determination. Successful
completion of these goals will provide a more global understanding of NRMT1 function and help better
develop NRMT1 as a therapeutic for human cancers and age-related disorders.

Environmental contamination by per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) is a major public health concern
because of the wide range of toxic effects that have been associated with exposure to these persistent chemicals.
Due to the strong stability of the C-F bond, very few microorganisms have been found capable of degrading
PFASs, and the biodegradation is very slow and incomplete. Often, bioremediation efforts result in the formation
of shorter chain PFASs that remain toxic, persistent, and highly mobile in the environment. Current abiotic
treatment technologies can be more effective, but have very high energy requirements. Therefore, this research
proposes an innovative remediation strategy that couples a pre-treatment step using catalytic hybrid
nanomaterials with biodegradation using enriched microbial communities to achieve more efficient and complete
destruction of PFASs without the formation of toxic by-products. Multifunctional reduced graphene oxide-metallic
nanohybrids (e.g. rGO-nZVI-TiO2) that are capable of catalyzing defluorination and oxidation of PFASs will be
synthesized and characterized for their efficiencies in converting highly stable PFASs to more biodegradable
forms. Pure cultures (e.g. Dehalococcoides sp. and Dehalobacter sp.) and enriched microbial consortia collected
from PFAS-contaminated sites and anaerobic wastewater treatment plants will be used to degrade different
types of PFASs and measure their removal efficacy. Using metagenomic and transcriptomic tools, the
microorganisms responsible for degradation, their functional characteristics, and the genes being transcribed
during defluorination will be identified. By-products formed at each step of the pre-treatment reaction, and during
the course of the microbial degradation of PFASs will be characterized using liquid chromatography with high-
resolution mass spectrometry, 19F-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and ion chromatography to obtain
information on the identities of PFASs transformation products, degradation kinetics, and mass balance.
Molecular modeling will be used to bring mechanistic insight into specific PFAS-surface and PFAS-enzyme
interactions. The effect of the structural features of PFASs (i.e. branching, chain-length, type of head groups) on
their biodegradability will be systematically evaluated, first by molecular modeling, and then by experimental
validation. Knowledge from the chemical characterization of PFASs degradation by-products combined with in
silico site-directed mutagenesis will facilitate the tuning of enzymatic activities and discovery of novel bacteria
that are efficient degraders of PFASs from the natural environment. These insights will guide the systematic
design of highly efficient nano-enhanced bioremediation systems for complete microbial degradation of PFASs.

The pathogenic fungus Cryptococcus neoformans continues to be the cause of 15% of AIDS-related mortality,
primarily in under-resourced areas of the globe. The work outlined in the proposal is a continuation of work
investigating post-transcriptional and translational mechanisms of stress adaptation in this important fungal
pathogen and investigate their conservation across clinical isolates from AIDS-associated cryptococcosis in
Africa. We have implicated translatome reprogramming as a requirement for the adaptation to host-
temperature stress as well as oxidative stress. This reprogramming is regulated at two points: the entry of
mRNAs into the translating pool through regulation of translation initiation, and the removal of mRNAs from the
pool by deadenylation-dependent mRNA decay. These two pathways cooperate in a stress-specific and
intensity-dependent manner to achieve a stress-adaptive translatome. In this proposal, we propose three
specific aims that outline a mechanistic investigation of these processes. First, we will investigate the
translational regulation of Gcn4, the transcription factor that controls expression of the integrated stress
response (ISR) regulon. We will define the C. neoformans ISR, and define the direct targets of Gcn4 in C.
neoformans. Second, we will build on preliminary data demonstrating that translation initiation regulation by the
kinase Gcn2 is activated by perturbations in other post-transcriptional and translation regulatory pathways
suggesting a role for Gcn2 as a failsafe responder to stress. We will investigate the contributions to
translatome reprogramming of these additional pathways, Hog1/p38, Nonsense Mediate Decay (NMD) and
Ribosome Quality Control (RQC) and investigate the role of Gcn2 activation in either suppressing or
exacerbating defects in translatome reprogramming or virulence phenotype. Finally, we will investigate the
mechanisms of translatome reprogramming in a panel of environmental C. neoformans isolates, as well as a
large collection of clinical isolates of C. neoformans from people with AIDS-associated cryptococcosis in Africa
that have accompanying outcome data and are fully genome sequenced. We will investigate the thresholds for
activation of these pathways and the intensity and duration of responses across the isolates, assessing
temperature dependent changes in translational output and both cytoplasmic and mitochondrial intracellular
reactive oxygen species as ISR activators. We will also determine if the ISR regulon differs across the panel of
clinical isolates. This work will define pathways responsible for the agility of this important pathogen that differ
from non-pathogen environmental relatives and from the model yeast and identify additional targets for future
therapeutic interventions.

Approximately 8.2 million Americans suffer from chronic wounds. Chronic wounds can be difficult to treat, and if
left untreated, they can lead to serious infections, tissue damage, and even amputation. Besides, the cost of
managing chronic wounds is very high – which requires frequent visits to healthcare providers, specialized
wound care products, and in some cases, hospitalization. This can place a financial burden on both patients and
the healthcare system. Blood perfusion, or the flow of blood to the tissues, is a critical factor in the healing of
chronic wounds. Chronic wounds often result from poor blood flow to the affected area, which can lead to a lack
of oxygen and nutrients necessary for the healing process. The long-term objective of this project is to improve
wound care and impact wound treatment services by developing low-cost technologies that aid with chronic
wound treatment and care. The primary objective of this application is to design, implement and validate
mHealth-based blood perfusion assessment tools to empower individuals with chronic wounds in daily life.
Building on our prior work, in this project we will enhance and validate a smartphone-based multi-spectral
imaging sensor to obtain perfusion-related measures (Aim 1), conduct a clinical study to validate mHealth-based
biomarkers with machine learning algorithms (Aim 2), and rigorously assess the tools in usability and learnability
(Aim 3). The approach is innovative because it will explore and validate new mobile computing and data-driven
techniques for wound care and blood perfusion assessment based on evidence-based ground truth. It holds the
potential to advance the current standard of wound care for recovery after discharge from clinical therapies.
These contributions are significant because they can extend the health self-management of our society through
proactive health care and real-time intervention, and reduce the subjective bias and financial burden for patients,

There are now 8 FDA-approved antibody-drug-conjugates (ADCs) on the market. ADC technology is being widely
pursued for oncology, autoimmunity, ophthalmology, and infectious disease applications. In spite of tremendous
success, however, the ADC development process is riddled with challenges associated with ADC aggregation, linker-
stability concerns, unexpected toxicity, and poor pharmacokinetics. While it is impossible to lay the blame for this at
the feet of a single phenomenon, one common factor shared by the vast majority of ADCs is the reliance on a
hydrophobic peptide linker (i.e. ValCit-PABC) that is stable in plasma but rapidly cleaved by lysosomal cathepsins.
Various studies have recently shown that this linker is more unstable in circulation was than previously believed, being
susceptible to cleavage by both plasma esterases (Ces1C) and lymphocyte-associated proteases (neutrophil elastase).
It is now widely believed that cleavage by neutrophil elastase is responsible for the dose-limiting neutropenia and
thrombocytopenia so commonly seen for many ADCs. A new generation of cleavable linkers is urgently needed in order
to overcome these liabilities. Herein, we propose the optimization and evaluation of “redesigned” ADC linkers that
contain asparagine (Asn) motifs which are rapidly cleaved by asparaginyl endoprotease, also known as legumain. Our
team has identified several Asn-containing sequences that are rapidly cleaved by lysosomal legumain while retaining
stability in mouse and human plasma. Our preliminary data shows that ADCs that incorporate these linkers exhibit
comparable in vitro cytotoxicity to classical ValCit-PABC linkers – but are not susceptible to cleavable by Ces1C or
neutrophil elastase. We have designed three specific aims to optimize this linker and to demonstrate that model ADCs
that use these linkers have improved therapeutic potential as compared to traditional ValCit-PABC linkers. Aim #1 is
is focused on the optimization of the peptide linker itself. We will prepare a FRET-based library of Asn-containing
peptides in order to identify robust linkers that can be incorporated into various cancer-targeting ADCs. Aim #2 is
focused on the development of suitable self-immolative spacers for the legumain cleavable peptides. The spacer will
be optimized in order to facilitate rapid cleavage in the lysosome and high stability in plasma. Aim #3 will establish
the therapeutic utility of legumain-cleavable ADCs in a model of pancreatic cancer. Specifically, we will incorporate
our novel linkers into anti-GCC ADCs that are of interest for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. The ADCs will be
compared head-to-head with a traditional ADC (TAK-264) that failed phase 2 clinical trials due to dose limiting
neutropenia. We anticipate that our novel linkers will impart an improved tolerability to this ADC while maintaining the
efficacy. Accomplishment of these aims will firmly establish the suitability of legumain-cleavage for therapeutic
applications – and will poise the technology for clinical application. Development of novel pancreatic-cancer targeting
ADCs will pave the way towards clinical evaluation in an area of tremendous unmet medical need.

Antibody drug conjugate (ADC) immunogenicity is a growing concern due to the increased interest in immune-
stimulating drug delivery technology. A recent study by Novartis demonstrated that 14 out of 14 patients dosed
with an experimental immune-stimulatory ADC developed a measurable anti-drug antibody (ADA) response.
ADA negatively affects treatment by neutralizing drugs, increasing drug clearance, and causing severe allergic
reactions. There is an urgent need for an effective method of conjugating payload to antibodies while
minimizing the development and the effects of ADAs. We have developed an ADC bioconjugation technology
that employs the conserved Q295 residue (continued funding provided by NIH 1RO1GM140026-O1A1) that we
believe will mitigate many of these ADA concerns. The goal of this proposal is to demonstrate that this
technology reduces Fc-gamma uptake in antigen presenting cells (APCs) and masks the drugs from binding to
ADAs by hiding them in a sterically occluded hydrophobic pocket on the Fc domain. This goal will be achieved
through the two aims. Aim #1 focuses on developing NMR and fluorescence-based tools to demonstrate that
ADC payloads at the Q295 site are constrained within the sterically occluded IgG1 hydrophobic pocket. To this
end we propose conjugating model payloads to the Q295 site using various linkers (such as short alkyl,
peptide, and PEG) and determining their proximity to the hydrophobic pocket using two experimental methods:
1) a proximity induced fluorescent quenching assay using Oregon Green 488, due to its ability to self-quench
and 2) F-19 protein NMR using a trifluoromethyl probe, due to its high sensitivity and low background level in
biological samples. Aim #2 focuses on demonstrating that payloads attached to the sterically occluded Q295
position have reduced ADA binding and reduced potential for eliciting immunogenicity caused by Fc-gamma
mediated uptake of ADCs. Achievement of the aims outlined herein will result in an antibody conjugation
technology that exhibits a reduced risk of ADA and may be useful for the design of immune-stimulating
antibody conjugates.

Cocaine use disorder is a complexly determined, heritable trait that imposes significant harm on those afflicted
and on society. Discovery of the genetic factors that influence cocaine use disorder risk is imperative for a
comprehensive understanding of cocaine addiction neurobiology. In an ongoing study, we have characterized
a large panel of inbred mouse lines for voluntary cocaine self-administration (IVSA). We are utilizing this
approach to identify genes and allelic variants that influence cocaine self-administration, including Neuron-
navigator-1 (Nav1), which has emerged as a candidate gene from our genetic analyses. Furthermore, inbred
reference strains in the HMDP that are predisposed to take large amounts of cocaine represent polygenic
models of extreme cocaine use and can be used to understand how risk variants collectively impact
neurobiology to ultimately affect cocaine self-administration. The project proposed here will directly investigate
the polygenic and single gene impact of genetic risk for extreme cocaine IVSA on mesolimbic dopamine
neurotransmission, a key neurobiological function impacted by cocaine and other drugs of abuse. This project
will provide training in fast-scan cyclic voltammetry, optogenetics and fiber photometry and will allow me to
create a unique niche in addiction neurogenetics research. Aim 1 will investigate the influence of polygenic risk
for extreme cocaine IVSA on dopamine neurotransmission in the Nucleus Accumbens (NAc) shell after acute
application of cocaine. This aim may reveal genetic influences on basal and acute dopamine responses that
underlie risk for dysregulated cocaine use. Aim 2 will investigate the influence of polygenic risk for extreme
cocaine IVSA on neuroadaptations in dopamine transmission in the NAc following chronic cocaine IVSA
exposure. This aim may reveal genetically determined adaptations of dopamine transmission that underlie
escalated use after chronic exposure. Aim 3 will evaluate the causal effects of experimental changes in Nav1
expression on dopamine transmission at the single-gene level. This project will advance understanding of how
genetics intersect with neurobiology to affect cocaine use. The training I will receive in conducting this project
will broaden my skill set and allow me to more effectively investigate addiction neurogenetics.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Recent decades have dramatically changed our view of RNA. While RNA was initially believed to be barely
a passive messenger in the transfer of genetic information from DNA to proteins, it is now clear that RNA is
an exciting and underexplored regulatory molecule that will continue to deliver new discoveries in biology
and medicine. Our research program strives to capitalize on these exciting future discoveries by exploring
chemical modifications to modulate the structure and function regulatory RNAs. The long-term goals are to
1) develop novel RNA chemical modifications for fundamental studies and biomedical applications, and 2)
explore new modes of sequence-specific recognition of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). Our research
program comprises two distinct but interrelated projects: 1) novel backbone modifications to improve
specificity of regulatory RNAs, and 2) triplex-forming peptide nucleic acids (PNAs) to modulate structure and
biological activity regulatory RNAs. Project 1 replaces internucleotide phosphates with amides and other
non-native linkages in short interfering RNAs and RNAs associated with clustered regularly interspaced
short palindromic repeats (CRISPR). The goals are to optimize the activity and sequence specificity of these
RNAs. The premise is that backbone modifications will remodel and improve RNA-protein interactions and,
hence, modulate the activity and specificity. Project 2 explores chemically modified PNA as a ligand for
sequence-specific conformational and functional control of biomedically important dsRNA. The goals are to
develop PNAs that shift between alternative structures of complex RNAs and to improve the cellular uptake
of PNA. The premise is that nucleobase-modified triplex-forming PNAs are uniquely suited for sequence-
specific recognition of dsRNA and will enable recognition of biologically important non-coding dsRNA. New
future directions will focus on biological activity of PNAs, especially, in phase-separated membrane-less
organelles. The projects involve collaborations with structural biochemists (Martin Egli, Janez Plavec),
biological chemists (Naoki Sugimoto), and biotech companies (Korro Bio, Inc.). The two projects share a
common theme of designing chemical modifications that take advantage of charge complementarity
between the RNA target and the ligands and proteins interacting with RNA. The overreaching idea is to
develop RNA chemical modifications and RNA binding ligands that avoid unproductive electrostatic
repulsion and capitalize on productive electrostatic attraction while concurrently enhancing sequence
specificity of molecular interactions. This thrust grows out of our recent discoveries that RNA is unusually
receptive to chemical modifications that neutralize the negative charge of phosphate backbone, both in RNA
itself and in RNA binding oligonucleotide analogues. If successful, our research will contribute to addressing
key gaps in RNA interference, CRISPR, and PNA technologies for recognition of therapeutically relevant
RNAs, and will open doors for development of unique research tools and new therapeutic strategies.

We are pursuing the first anti-tumor small molecules that act specifically against human Sonic Hh protein
autoprocessing, a unique biosynthetic event that is necessary to drive oncogenic hedgehog (Hh) ligand
dependent cell/cell signaling. Sonic Hh protein autoprocessing involves a precursor form of Hh and is
responsible for liberating the mature Sonic Hh signaling ligand while also modifying the ligand’s terminal
carboxyl group with cholesterol. The long-standing challenge has been to discover small molecules that
specifically antagonize this key reaction within the tumor cell. To facilitate discovery, we have devised the
first in-cell assay system to screen for antagonists of human Hh autoprocessing at high throughput. Our
assay couples intracellular Sonic Hh autoprocessing to the extracellular secretion of a bioluminescent
reporter enzyme. We recently miniaturized this assay for 1536-well plates and in preliminary work,
completed a successful pilot screen against LOPAC. Here we propose a two-year high risk/gain strategy
that integrates: (AIM 1) In-cell quantitative high throughput screening in collaboration with the National
Center for Advancing Translational Science (NCATS) to discover the first bioactive drug-like antagonists
of human Sonic Hh autoprocessing; (AIM 2) Pre-clinical evaluation of the anti-tumor effects of those novel
Hh autoprocessing inhibitors toward human multiple myeloma and human colon cancer cells, which exhibit
Hh-ligand dependent growth. We hypothesize that specific antagonists of Sonic Hh autoprocessing will
deplete extracellular Sonic Hh ligand. Tumor apoptosis is the expected result of this ligand deprivation
strategy. In summary, using an innovative assay and novel anti-Hh approach, we are poised to address a
significant gap in the field of Hh signaling while pursuing a new class of cancer therapeutics.

Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a leading cause of disability worldwide and a critical public health problem.
Of particular concern are the high rates of MDD during adolescence, which have continued to increase in recent
years. Importantly, the emergence of depression during adolescence is associated with future major depressive
episodes in adulthood and risk for suicide. Theorists have proposed that the spike in rates of depression
observed during adolescence may be due, at least in part, to neurobiological and psychosocial changes that
occur during this period, including changes in reward processing. Importantly, aberrant neural reward processing
in adolescents is associated with current depressive symptoms and predicts the onset of future depressive
episodes. However, most of this research has focused on adolescents’ neural responses to monetary reward,
despite research showing that social rewards are especially salient for this age group. Further, a large majority
of this research is confined to laboratory settings and relatively little is known about how laboratory-based
measures of reward processing translate to real-world experiences of pleasure and affect. This proposed study
aims to address the limitations of extant research by examining event related potential (ERP) indices of social
and monetary reward processing in adolescents at heightened risk of developing MDD (maternal history of
MDD). After completing the laboratory-based reward tasks, adolescents will complete 7 days of ecological
momentary assessment (EMA) surveys to assess real-world levels of pleasure and affect in their daily lives.
Specific Aim 1 is to determine whether laboratory-based measures of reward outcome processing predict real-
world levels of consummatory pleasure and affect among adolescents at risk for MDD. Specific Aim 2 is to
evaluate whether monetary or social reward processing is a stronger predictor of real-world reports of pleasure
and daily affect. In addressing these aims, I also seek to address another limitation of existing research.
Specifically, the overwhelming majority of ERP reward processing research focuses on the reward positivity
(RewP), which only indexes one subcomponent of reward outcome processing even though other substages
can be reliably assessed with ERPs (e.g., feedback-P3 and feedback-LPP). Therefore, although primary
analyses will focus on the RewP to be consistent with prior research, exploratory analyses will examine whether
the predictive validity of the feedback-P3 and feedback-LPP. These research aims are complemented by a series
of training goals designed to facilitate the applicant’s development into an independent researcher. These
training goals are to (i) gain expertise in collecting and processing EEG/ERP data using reward paradigms, (ii)
develop specialized skills in designing, collecting, and processing reward-relevant EMA data in adolescents, and
(iii) strengthening the applicant’s knowledge of intensive longitudinal data analysis. This project has the potential
to make significant contributions to the literature on biomarkers of depression risk and will provide the training
necessary for the applicant to become an independent researcher focused on risk for depression in adolescents.

naturally occurring modifications.
ABSTRACT:
 Solid phase synthesis of RNA is an important genomic tool, which offers precise control over the
oligonucleotide sequence and offers an opportunity for site-specific incorporation of RNA modifications,
fluorescent labels and biochemical tags. Discoveries of the twenty-first century created a strong need for a robust
synthesis of RNA strands, that are 100-200 nucleotides (-nt) in length. A major limitation of otherwise highly
optimized process is purification, which is notoriously difficult, labor intensive and requires expensive HPLC
instrumentation. As the result, solid phase synthesis of long oligonucleotides containing RNA modifications is
rarely attempted. This technology-development proposal aims to address this limitation by developing a non-
chromatographic RNA purification method which will be 10-times faster and 2-orders of magnitude cheaper and
will allow isolation of strands that are 100-200-nt long in good yield and 98% purity.
 The proposed purification strategy is based on bio-orthogonal inverse electron demand Diels-Alder (IEDDA)
chemistry between trans-cyclooctene (TCO) and tetrazine (Tz) that allows to selectively tag and purify
structurally complex and increasing long RNA strands from the failure strands that accrue during solid phase
synthesis. TCO and Tz are highly selective for each other and have minimal cross-reactivity with other functional
groups found in RNA. The bio-orthogonal click chemistry is highly efficient, even at very low concentrations of
TCO and Tz. During preliminary studies we have shown that our strategy allows efficient synthesis and
purification of 76-nt long tRNA and 101-nt long sgRNA with yields that were 10-times higher than conventional
purification methods.
 During the proposed research program, we aim to improve a number of important elements of our design to
bring the overall process to under 7 hrs, further improve the overall yield and purity of the isolated RNA. In Aim
1, we propose to expedite the process by developing a new photolabile linker that will allow fast photocleavage
using visible light. To improve purity and yield of isolated RNA, we propose to optimize the solid phase synthesis
procedure to ensure that all failure sequences are fully capped during each synthetic cycle. The optimized
process will be applied to increasingly longer RNA strands, from 76-nt tRNA to 188-nt long U2 snRNA. In Aim 2,
we plan to illustrate the power of our technology by synthesizing a 144-nt long artificial mRNA, containing m1A
and m6A modifications near the start codon. This will be the longest reported oligonucleotide containing RNA
modifications. The artificial mRNA will be utilized to investigate the impact of RNA modifications on the rate of in
vitro translation. We plan to work with NHGRI technology development team to make the proposed technology
widely available to researchers.

This proposal focuses on the divergent effects of the two major dietary forms of vitamin K on breast cancer. K
vitamins act as cofactors for gamma-glutamyl carboxylase (GGCX), which post-translationally introduces γ-
carboxyglutamate residues into proteins. Although most of the 17 known γ-carboxylated proteins function in
coagulation and bone homeostasis, the presence of GGCX in most tissues (including mammary gland) suggests
more extensive physiological roles for vitamin K. We have demonstrated that triple negative breast cancer
(TNBC) cell lines express GGCX and produce γ-carboxylated proteins in response to vitamin K1 (phylloquinone),
the major dietary form. In TNBC cells, K1 treatment enriches for the stem cell marker aldehyde dehydrogenase
1 (ALDH1) and promotes mammosphere formation. These data suggest that K1 sustains GGXC mediated γ-
carboxylation to drive aggressive breast cancer phenotypes. Through analysis of genomic cancer datasets, we
find that ~25% of breast tumors express GGCX and the vitamin K oxidoreductase (VKOR) genes required for its
activity. Patients with such tumors have poorer survival than those whose tumors do not express these genes at
high levels. Patients with this subtype of tumor would be candidates for therapies that limit K1 availability and/or
inhibit GGCX. Surprisingly, we found that vitamin K2 (menaquinone-4), another naturally occurring form present
in diet, does not stimulate γ-carboxylation or stem cell phenotypes in TNBC cells, but instead strongly suppresses
cell growth, migration and energy metabolism. These provocative data indicate that K1 and K2 exert distinct
effects on breast cancer cells, with K1 promoting and K2 suppressing aggressive phenotypes. We also found
that expression of the vitamin K2 biosynthesis enzyme UbiA Prenyltransferase Domain Containing 1 (UBIAD1)
is undetectable in TNBC, suggesting altered cellular handling of vitamin K. In Aim 1 we will dissect the effects
of K1 and K2 in vitro, evaluate the role of UBIAD1 and conduct feeding studies to measure accumulation of K1
and K2 in TNBC xenografts and host mammary gland in relation to tumor growth. In Aim 2 we will determine
whether deletion of GGCX from TNBC cells impacts γ-carboxylated protein synthesis and aggressive
phenotypes in vitro and in vivo. Aim 3 will identify relevant γ-carboxylated GGCX substrate proteins that mediate
the effects of K1. We anticipate that growth of tumors with high GGCX activity and low UBIAD1 will be stimulated
by high dietary K1 and inhibited by high dietary K2. These findings would identify GGCX as an oncogene and
the vitamin K pathway as a therapeutic target in a subset of patients with advanced breast cancer.

CAG repeat expansion diseases are the most common class of microsatellite expansion disorders. While
canonical translation of the CAG repeat leads to the production of polyglutamine proteins, these expansions can
also undergo non-canonical repeat associated non-AUG (RAN) translation. In the later process, translation is
initiated across multiple reading frames in the absence of AUG- or AUG-like start codons. While a few factors
that influence either canonical translation across microsatellite expansions or RAN translation have been
identified, our understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms responsible for translation in multiple
reading frames is extremely limited. Despite evidence that RNA structure plays a key role in RAN translation our
knowledge of the structural features that facilitate RAN translation is extremely limited. To examine the role of
RNA structure in non-canonical translation, I used a structure-forward approach to screen for multi-frame
translation, through which I identified several long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) that support translation in
multiple reading frames in the absence of both microsatellite repeat expansions and AUG-start codons. This
data suggests multiple avenues for RNA transcripts to support multi-frame translation, which has important
implications in biology, disease, and therapeutics. The overarching goal of this proposal is to determine the RNA
structures, protein networks and therapeutically relevant modifiers that govern various forms of multi-frame
translation (MFT). To determine the proportion of the human genome capable of undergoing MFT, I will utilize a
novel MFT reporter system to perform a genome-wide screen. Utilising candidate MFT sequences and CAG
repeat expansions along with my already identified MFT lncRNAs, I will determine the cellular RNA structures
and protein factors that facilitate non-canonical multi-frame translation. I will also employ a first-of-its-kind
strategy to identify novel, therapeutically relevant modifiers of co-occurring canonical and non-canonical
translation in multiple reading frames. These studies will enable a better understanding of the mechanism of
multi-frame translation and identify therapeutic strategies that have the potential to provide therapeutic efficacy
across multiple CAG repeat expansion diseases and be applicable to a wider range of neurological diseases.
Together this research provides an innovative approach to understand a novel paradigm for translation diversity
and will enable a better understanding of disease pathogenesis in repeat expansion diseases as well as
elucidating the aspects of MFT most suitable to therapeutic intervention.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：With an ever-aging population and an estimated prevalence of Alzheimer disease of 5.7 million people
in the United States alone, the impetus for more targeted treatments for age-related cognitive disorders is greater
now than ever. Neuroplasticity, the ability of neural networks to adapt and remodel given experience, dwindles
with age, providing possible mechanistic insights into this decline. An important layer of neuroplasticity, unique
to a couple of discrete areas of the adult mammalian brain, is the addition of newly-generated neurons into
existing circuits, a process known as neurogenesis. While the existence and importance of adult hippocampal
neurogenesis in young adults has been well-established, we know very little about hippocampal neurogenesis
in aging brains. Importantly, hippocampal neurogenesis continues into old age although there is a substantial
decline in the number of newborn neurons. For example, in 26-month-old rodents, ~1000 proliferating cells could
be detected per day, although only half that detected in 5-month-old adult rats. A recent study demonstrated that
thousands of new neurons could be detected in the aged adult human dentate gyrus, and further, that in patients
with Alzheimer disease, newborn neurons were fewer in number and exhibited delayed maturation. As a starting
point, we ask why neurogenesis declines in the aging brain. Based on our preliminary studies, we found that
biased circuit activity may regulate hippocampal neurogenesis in the aging brain. During screening of potential
molecules biasing circuit activity, we found that one sphingolipid signaling is active in interneurons and becomes
less active in the aging brain. We propose to genetically intervene this signaling to study its role in regulating
neurogenesis in the aging brain. Lastly, we determine how biased circuit activity regulates hippocampal
neurogenesis. Our results will not only provide mechanistic insights into the understanding of neurogenesis in
the aging brain it also provides a possible strategy to intervene aging circuit activity to regulate neurogenesis.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Project Summary: While mechanical thrombectomy has advanced the treatment of large vessel occlusion
(LVO) stroke, over 50% of patients still suffer from significant disability or death. Ischemia/reperfusion injury
(I/RI), the result of restoring blood flow to deeply ischemic tissue, accelerates recruitment of polymorphonuclear
neutrophils (PMNs). PMNs exert poor outcomes in two ways. First, PMNs physically obstruct
cerebral microvessels in the stroke bed despite macrovascular reperfusion – a condition known as microvascular
‘no-reflow’. Second, PMNs exert toxic effects regionally once recruited at postcapillary venules and extravasated
into the infarcted brain. Accordingly, preclinical studies that block PMN recruitment have had success in reducing
stroke burden and improving neurologic outcome. Unfortunately, these preclinical studies have not been
successful in human trials. These translational roadblocks may be addressed by investigating the spatiotemporal
determinants of PMN recruitment as it relates to the in vivo cerebrovasculature during stroke. Using a mouse
stroke model to simulate the LVO population and novel histopathological and imaging techniques, my preliminary
data have found that PMN recruitment throughout I/RI is non-uniform up to 72 hours after infarction. PMNs were
also found to progress cortically to subcortically throughout I/RI over the course of 72 hours, with partial restriction
to the cortical surface by administration of an antibody that blocks transendothelial migration (TEM). These
results support the concept of stroke microenvironments – highly regionalized areas within an infarct where
inflammation and impaired microcirculation interface with each other. I hypothesize that these stroke
microenvironments within an infarct are due to feedback loops between 1) microvascular flow and oxygenation;
and 2) PMN recruitment. To test this hypothesis, I will investigate two aims: 1) Defining and physiologically
manipulating the stroke microenvironment 2) Determine how PMN infiltration and position regulates I/RI over
time. I will test these aims using techniques of multimodal in vivo animal imaging, advanced microscopy, and
targeted manipulation of both leukocyte biology and stroke physiology. These studies will ultimately be used to
identify molecular similarities of PMNs in particularly toxic stroke microenvironments, facilitating the investigation
and creation of novel leukocyte-based therapies. To complete these long-term goals, I will incorporate a
multidisciplinary mentorship team and short-term goals of developing expertise in live-animal imaging, advanced
microscopy, and leukocyte biology. With this K08 proposal, I will build a unique translational stroke program that
defines the interplay of stroke physiology and pathology to develop more precise and translatable therapies for
stroke patients.

for RMS consists of intensive multi-agent chemotherapy and has not significantly changed in nearly five decades. These
compounds target general vulnerabilities of rapidly dividing cells and are not specific to the pathophysiology of RMS. As
such, treatment is accompanied by a suite of toxicities with potentially lifelong repercussions in pediatric patients.
Approximately 20% of RMS patients present with metastatic disease at diagnosis, and the failure-free survival rate for
these patients is only 30% after five years. Hence, there is a pressing need for specific yet potent therapies for RMS.
 High-throughput, negative-selection genetic screens across cell lines of varying tumor types have the potential to
reveal growth dependencies specific to a given cancer. Our results from these functional genomics experiments identified
myogenic differentiation 1 (MYOD) as the most potent growth dependency factor specific to RMS. MYOD is a member
of the basic Helix-Loop-Helix family of transcription factors and is a master regulator of muscle differentiation. MYOD is
one of the predominant myogenic markers used in the clinical diagnosis of RMS but has long been thought to be
functionally inactive in RMS, as this cancer does not complete the myogenic differentiation program. However, in light of
our genetic screening data, we hypothesize that RMS exploits the transcriptional activity of MYOD to drive growth of the
tumor. The proposed research aims to determine the molecular mechanisms by which MYOD regulates growth of RMS.
The outlined experiments will identify features of MYOD necessary for sustaining RMS growth (Aim 1), uncover the
genetic targets of MYOD that mediate growth (Aim 2), and evaluate the functional significance of MYOD targets (Aim
3). Data from these experiments will provide insight into the molecular pathophysiology of RMS and may reveal critical
nodes in this program that warrant therapeutic investigation.
 The requisite skills and knowledge to carry out this research proposal will be supported by the integrated basic
and medical science education in the Medical Scientist Training Program at Stony Brook University (SBU). The
mentorship and environments at SBU and Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory will provide all of the necessary resources for a
tailored training program to effectively develop the applicant into an independent experimentalist, analyst, and
communicator of cancer research.

Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) results from mutations in the DMD gene, which generates the protein
dystrophin. Although the gene produces various sized isoforms, only the largest isoform, Dp427, performs a
critical function in skeletal muscle by linking the extracellular matrix (ECM) to the cytoskeleton. DMD mutations
can also cause neurological dysfunction, but the cell and molecular basis of these changes are poorly under-
stood. Interestingly, the severity of cognitive deficits seen in DMD worsens with successive loss of the smaller
isoforms that cannot connect the ECM and cytoskeleton, implying additional functions these shorter dystrophins.
DMD patients have reduced total brain and gray matter volume, with mutations that affect transcription of the
mid-size isoform Dp140 being most strongly linked to this reduction16. I propose here to explore the role of dys-
trophin in the developing ventricular/subventricular zone (V-SVZ), the major neural stem cell niche (NSC) in the
adult mammalian brain. A key output of the V-SVZ during postnatal brain development is oligodendrocyte pro-
genitor cells (OPCs), which go on to myelinate the forebrain. The timing and proper execution of myelination
plays a critical role in many of the same neurological processes that are affected in DMD. Ependymal cells (ECs)
are specialized multi-ciliated cells in the V-SVZ that line the ventricles of the brain that surround NSCs and
regulate NSC quiescence and activation. My sponsor’s lab recently reported that dystroglycan, the binding part-
ner of dystrophin, modulates notch signaling in V-SVZ NSCs to regulate both NSC fate decisions and the devel-
opment of ECs24. Dystroglycan and dystrophin were also both found to influence postnatal OPC development,
including delaying white matter tract myelination. Dysregulated notch signaling has been reported in muscle
stem cells in animal models of DMD41, however, whether dystrophin regulates notch in NSCs remains unknown.
In my first aim, I will investigate how dystrophin isoforms regulate early postnatal V-SVZ niche formation by
examining EC development and organization into pinwheels. In the second aim, I will explore how dystrophin
isoforms regulate V-SVZ NSC function and the production of neuronal and glial progenitors. Throughout I will
examine dystrophin’s ability to regulate notch signaling in V-SVZ NSCs and test whether dystrophin-deficient
cell phenotypes can be rescued by modulating the notch pathway. I will use small dystrophin constructs and
DMD mouse models (mdx, mdx4cv, mdx3cv) in combination with notch activity reporter mice. Intriguingly, small
dystrophins have been reported to translocate to the nucleus in muscle cells, indicating the potential for novel
functional roles for small dystrophins in the nucleus of NSCs, which will be assessed by modification of se-
quences needed for nuclear import/export. Lastly, as a complementary approach, I will use neonatal ventricle
electroporation strategies to prevent or rescue dystrophin expression in the developing V-SVZ and use V-SVZ
cell cultures that model NSC and EC development. Together, my studies will investigate dystrophin’s role in the
formation and function of a crucial stem cell niche that generates neural progenitors for the postnatal brain.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
The development of small molecule inhibitors has revolutionized targeted therapeutics, especially in the field of
protein kinases. However, pharmaceutical development continues to be plagued by two problems: (i) designing
specific drugs with limited off-target toxicity and (ii) combating the occurrence of resistance mutations in the
target of interest. The role of binding kinetics, referring to a ligand’s association and dissociation rate to its target,
are underexplored and underexploited in addressing these issues. In the non-equilibrium environment of the
human body, drug on- and off-rates have proven to be superior optimization parameters for candidate
compounds than the traditional IC50 and KD metrics. Furthermore, mutations that reduce drug residence time,
defined as how long a drug stays bound to its target, can presumably confer resistance to therapy.
Imatinib, the seminal achievement of rational drug design, inhibits the BCR-Abl oncoprotein and has reduced
the mortality rate for chronic myelogenous leukemia by 80%. Imatinib’s specificity for Abl kinase is due to its
conformational selectivity, and its success has sparked intense efforts to discover specific inhibitors of kinases
dysregulated in cancer and inflammatory disease. Despite its clinical success, relapse to imatinib therapy due to
resistance mutations is common, and a fundamental understanding of how mutations distant from the ligand
binding site cause resistance continues to elude us. We have preliminarily identified a series of patient-derived
resistance mutations that paradoxically show no change in equilibrium affinity for imatinib. We have also
validated that the Abl N368S mutant causes imatinib resistance by increasing drug dissociation rate. Therefore,
I propose using these Abl kinase mutations as a model system to explore how binding kinetics affect ligand
specificity, potency, and efficacy. My central hypothesis is that altered inhibitor binding or dissociation
kinetics could cause resistance independent of inhibitor affinity. I will explore this hypothesis by measuring
the effects of Abl kinase mutations on drug residence time and efficacy and by defining the conformational
changes of the Abl N368S substitution.
Through these studies, I will determine the structural mechanism of “kinetic resistance” mutations, a novel type
of drug resistance which I believe extends throughout the kinome. I will also elucidate key structural factors in
the conformational exchange of Abl kinase and the imatinib unbinding process. In addition, I will provide insight
into how prolonging in vivo drug action through slow dissociation rates can be applied to develop drugs with
minimal off-target toxicity. The contributions from this proposal are significant because they will validate altered
binding kinetics as both a novel mechanism of drug resistance in a highly-therapeutically relevant protein family
and as a viable strategy to improve drug specificity.

 Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) maintains its status as one of most lethal solid cancers with
a 5-year survival of 8%. Minor improvements have been attributed to early detection, but the vast majority of
patients face a grim prognosis without effective therapeutic intervention. Molecular analysis of patient samples
has often been confounded by mixed biological samples, leading to reproducibility challenges. Previously, our
lab performed virtual microdissection on bulk RNA-seq patient samples establishing robust prognostic gene
signatures describing an aggressive basal-like and drug-responsive classical tumor subtypes highlighting the
importance of cancer heterogeneity across patients. Using these signatures as patient classifiers has been an
important utility in preliminary clinical trials and therapeutic profiling of patient derived organoids.
 Building evidence suggests patient unique TME composition impacts PDAC progression and resistance
to standard treatments. While patient tissue characterization with bulk measurements has provided key insights
into cancer biology, parsing the complex tumor microenvironments requires higher resolution due to the
widespread stromal involvement and sparse neoplastic populations. Single-cell sequencing delivers the
analytical power to help identify variable TME elements between patients that lead to the distinct prognostic and
therapeutic responses. Thus, understanding the extent and role of TME heterogeneity in PDAC across patient
tumor subtypes is paramount to widen the door for personalized medicine in oncology.
 In this proposal, I will establish a comprehensive single-cell atlas of human PDAC TME to significantly
lower the barrier between researchers and complex single-cell transcriptomics data to explore novel prognostic
and synergistic therapeutic targets. I will use local and public single cell RNA-seq data of PDAC tissue to
investigate the extent and role of cellular heterogeneity across patient tumor subtypes. Specifically, I will define
molecular signatures and map out the interactome of functional cell types within stromal, lymphocytic, myeloid
populations at unprecedented spatial resolution. Ultimately, by integrating high-dimensional data from single-cell
RNA-seq and Spatial Transcriptomics, this work will shed light on the intricate tissue pathology while laying down
a broad framework for understanding multi-axis cell interactions behind progression and resistance in diverse
cancer types.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Project Summary / Abstract
 Over two decades of research has focused on elucidating the pathophysiology of working memory (WM)
deficits in patients with schizophrenia in the hopes of finding effective treatments, as these deficits are more
closely linked to functional outcomes in patients than are psychotic symptoms, and they are presumed to arise
from alterations in dopaminergic function that may be fundamental to the pathogenesis of schizophrenia.
However, the overwhelming majority of research in this area has treated WM as a unitary cognitive ability that
is assayed equally well by any of the wide range of tasks commonly employed in functional Magnetic Resonance
Imaging (fMRI) studies of patients with schizophrenia. In contrast, empirical evidence suggests that at least
three distinct cognitive abilities contribute to performance on WM tasks: attentional control, short-term
memory capacity, and long-term (or secondary) memory retrieval. These are presumed to have dissociable
neural substrates and may be differentially impaired in different patients, which would serve to obscure
potential biomarkers of WM deficit in case-control fMRI studies of patients. The NIMH Research Domain
Criteria (RDoC) Matrix attempts to capture some of this complexity by defining four subconstructs of WM
(active maintenance, flexible updating, limited capacity, and interference controls), although these differ from
those based on empirical work described above, and no empirical work to date has attempted to determine the
extent to which various WM tasks tap these four putative subconstructs. The overarching goal of this
application is to conduct a large-scale latent-variable analysis of the most commonly employed WM tasks in the
fMRI literature of schizophrenia, along with a broad array of other cognitive tasks, in order to clarify the
underlying cognitive abilities (or subconstructs) that subserve WM task performance and to identify neural
correlates of these empirically identified subconstructs. To this end, 500 participants will undergo behavioral
testing on 9 WM and 12 other cognitive tasks in order to provide a robust dataset for latent variable analysis
using factor analytic and structural equation modeling techniques that will identify the subconstructs that
underlie performance on each of the WM tasks. Next, 80 patients with schizophrenia and 80 matched control
participants will undergo the same battery of tasks, but will perform 7 of the WM tasks during fMRI scanning,
in order to identify neural correlates of the subconstructs that are specifically disrupted in schizophrenia. This
work will help to advance our understanding of WM deficits in schizophrenia and will identify specific neural
targets, and the optimal tasks that future investigators can employ to target them, that are disrupted in
schizophrenia. These neural targets can then form the basis for establishing target engagement in clinical trials
aimed at finding treatments for cognitive deficits in schizophrenia.

 Schizophrenia is among the most severe and burdensome medical conditions worldwide, yet the brain alterations
that lead to the symptoms of schizophrenia remain unknown. This K23 application presents a research and training
program that will support the applicant on a path towards becoming an NIH-funded independent investigator focused
on understanding the neurobiology of schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders. The activities in this application
build on the candidate’s prior training and are set in a resource-rich environment that will foster her development of
expertise in 1) application of MRS and advanced MRI neuroimaging methodologies; 2) physician-scientist approaches to
studying pathophysiology in patients with schizophrenia; 3) neurocircuitry and systems neuroscience perspectives on
hippocampus pathology in psychotic disorders; and 4) responsible conduct of research. The overarching goal of the
research to be carried out in this application is to take findings from animal models of schizophrenia, which were
motivated by original research in patients with the disorder, back to the clinical setting in order to determine whether
the brain circuit alterations observed in the animal models are observable in human patients. Specifically, findings in the
prenatal methylazoxymethanol acetate (MAM) rodent model, which was developed to model the alterations in
dopamine function seen in patients with schizophrenia, suggest hyperactivity of the ventral (anterior) hippocampus may
increase its glutamatergic output to the ventral striatum and lead, via ventral pallidal and other GABAergic projections to
the ventral midbrain, to disinhibited firing of dopamine neurons. In addition, a convergence of several post mortem and
in vivo imaging findings in patients suggests that abnormal GABAergic activity in the hippocampus may further
compound hippocampal glutamatergic overdrive. This project will directly test the relationships among these
neurochemical alterations in individual medication-free patients with schizophrenia using sophisticated magnetic
resonance imaging methods. If this non-invasive, multimodal imaging paradigm provides evidence to relate hippocampal
GABA and glutamate abnormalities to dopamine system dysfunction in patients with schizophrenia, it would have
important implications for the understanding of the brain bases of schizophrenia, and would generate a novel
multimodal imaging paradigm for testing new molecular, anatomical, and circuit-modulating targets for treatment of
this devastating illness.

Rickettsia is a genus of arthropod-borne pathogens responsible for typhus and spotted fever diseases. Hallmark
of Rickettsia is their reductive genome evolution, obligate intracellular lifecycle within vascular endothelial cells,
immune escape in the bloodstream, and transmission via blood-feeding arthropods, with Rickettsia replicating
in the gastrointestinal tract or salivary glands of their various vectors (e.g., lice, ticks, mites, or fleas). Recent
environmental and sociological changes have supported the invasion and expansion of arthropod vectors into
new geographical areas, prompting healthcare alerts for the increasing arthropod-borne rickettsial infections.
Owing to the technical difficulties of isolating, propagating, and genetically manipulating Rickettsia, early work
studied rickettsial virulence mechanisms by expressing target genes in heterologous organisms (such as
Escherichia coli) or characterizing rickettsial variants with different genetic backgrounds. While these studies
identified putative virulence genes, they failed to address the biological functions involved in rickettsial
pathogenesis, transmission, and host immunity against typhus and spotted fever diseases. To explore the
genetic bases of rickettsial pathogenesis, recent studies developed genetic tools for Rickettsia and characterized
rickettsial variants. These investigations characterized several Rickettsia mutants with defects in actin-based
motility, O-antigen synthesis, and cell-to-cell spread. Nevertheless, genes underpinning rickettsial entry into
vascular endothelial cells, intracellular immune evasion and replication, release and survival in the bloodstream,
or replication in various cell types of their arthropod vectors remain largely uncharacterized. This application
describes an in vitro transposition reaction using purified Tn5-transposase complexed with the kkaebi mini-
transposon, which provides for chloramphenicol selection of Rickettsia variants with single chromosomal
insertions. DNA sequencing of insertion sites demonstrates the random nature of insertional mutagenesis with
the kkaebi-transposon, while chloramphenicol-selection allows for facile isolation of variants that can be analyzed
for in vitro replication as well as defects in the pathogenesis and transmission. In the first phase (R61) of this
application, kkaebi variants will be generated using two model organisms of pathogenic Rickettsia (R. conorii
from the spotted fever group and R. typhi from the typhus group). After the successful completion of the first
phase, kkaebi variants will be characterized for phenotypic alterations using biochemical and molecular
analyses, tissue culture infections, tick infection models, and mouse infection studies. Overall, this work will
generate key experimental resources for the research community to comprehensively identify rickettsial genes
essential for pathogenesis and transmission by arthropod vectors.

For monoclonal antibody(mAb)-based radiopharmaceuticals to widely impact precision nuclear medicine,
strategies that both improve the convenience and reduce the radiation burden to non-target organs are urgently
needed. Compared to direct-labeling strategies, pretargeting makes mAb-based nuclear imaging and targeted
radionuclide therapy (TRT) safer, but it has yet to realize its potential impact on clinical precision nuclear
medicine. However, the modest successes and inherent limitations of existing pretargeting platforms have
defined that a successful platform needs: 1) to be nonimmunogenic, 2) designed to be modular and tunable to
any mAb and radionuclide, and 3) to avoid clearing agents. To date, no platform has met these criteria, and there
remains a critical need for pretargeting strategies to improve precision nuclear medicine.
The long-term goal of this proposal is to develop a host:guest pretargeting platform that utilizes curcubit[7]uril
(CB7) “hosts” and adamantane (Adma) radioligand “guests” for nuclear imaging and TRT with elementally-
matched 203Pb (imaging) and 212Pb (therapy). CB7-Adma host:guest pretargeting is based on nonimmunogenic
molecules, uses a modular approach, and can achieve high uptake in target tissues using mAb targeting vectors
with lag times that nullify the need for clearing agents. Thus, it is hypothesized that this platform will address the
shortcomings of other platforms yielding a translatable radiotheranostic approach to cancer treatment.
Specific Aim 1 of this proposal is the “Development and evaluation of 203/212Pb-labeled radioligands for
pretargeting.” To achieve this goal, a library of radioligands will be synthesized and evaluated in vitro as well as
in vivo, optimizing the parameters of the host:guest pretargeting approach and comparing the dosimetry to a
direct-labeling strategy in order to demonstrate the platform’s suitability for clinical translation
Specific Aim 2 is the “Evaluation of 212Pb pretargeted alpha-TRT in murine xenograft models.” Using the
strategies for pretargeting developed in Specific Aim 1 as well as a fractionated dosing approach, we will
establish the efficacy of our host:guest pretargeting for alpha-TRT. We will also compare the dosimetry,
therapeutic index, therapeutic efficacy, and radiological toxicity to analogous approaches with directly-labeled
mAbs in a mouse model of cancer to validate the advantages.
Successfully achieving the aims of the proposed studies will lead to the development and validation of a next
generation pretargeting platform that is suitable for future translational studies and demonstrate its potential as
an innovative theranostic application for TRT. The platform will be a robust, safe, and convenient alternative to
direct-labeling strategies for mAbs that is widely applicable to precision nuclear medicine in human disease.

Title: Advanced Single-Cell Protein Analysis with Multiplex in Situ Tagging Array Technology
Single-cell analysis has been the essential approach in understanding cellular machinery, organism development,
and disease mechanisms. Proteins are naturally one of the main targets in single-cell analysis since proteins are
responsible for nearly every task for the cellular life. Unfortunately, proteins are not amplifiable like DNA, and
thus the minuscule amount of proteins on single cells poses a great challenge to the detection techniques. To
date, there is still no single-cell proteome technology available yet that has sufficient sensitivity and scale. We
have innovated a few single-cell protein detection techniques on an ultrahigh-density multiplex in situ tagging
(MIST) array which demonstrates its power for not only analyzing the full spectrum of function proteome in animal
and human cells, but also rapidly detecting cluster of surface proteins on smaller microbial pathogens. The MIST
array is a large-scale monolayer of small-size microbeads with a density much higher than most genome chips,
and the microbeads carry various probes for protein detection. The single-cell MIST (scMIST) technology has
exhibited it ability to quantify in single cells up to 465 functional proteins, which is the highest multiplexity assay
and the most comprehensive mapping of T cell protein markers. The smaller scale of the assay proved its utility
in prediction of sepsis outcomes by analyzing large quantity of primary samples. In the proposed research, we
will extend scMIST to spatially analyze solid tissue specimens by quantifying ~500 functional proteins to
thoroughly assess cellular features, physiological status and functions within a tissue microenvironment. In
addition, we will optimize the scMIST and combine it with artificial intelligence algorithms to precisely prognose
disease occurrence and progression. Last, an explosion-like biomolecular chain reaction will be developed on
the MIST array to rapidly detect few protein copies on single bacteria or viral particles by specifically amplifying
signals for millions to billions of times, with the goal of visually detecting single pathogens within a minute. The
implementation of these advanced single-cell protein detection technologies will catalyze the revolution of
biomedical sciences and fundamentally enhance the precision of disease prognosis. Visual detection of single
pathogens within a minute will bring enormous opportunities in broadly many areas concerned with pathogens.

 The search for more effective treatment and prevention of tuberculosis has motivated the identification
genes that are essential for the growth and survival of the causative agent, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb).
These genes are potential new targets for developing and attenuated live vaccines. For example, targeting
metabolite biosynthesis can prevent Mtb from making essential building blocks and generate auxotrophs that
induce protective immunity, but do not cause disease. Riboflavin (vitamin B2) biosynthesis has been proposed
as a drug target because putative biosynthetic genes have been shown as essential in multiple transposon
screens, but Mtb is assumed to be unattainable as a riboflavin auxotroph and depend entirely on de novo
synthesis in vivo because it lacks a homologue for a known bacterial riboflavin transporter. However, our
critical review of the literature along with our preliminary data on inducible knockdown strains for riboflavin
biosynthesis genes provide an opportunity to test our central hypothesis that Mtb takes up riboflavin via a
noncanonical transport mechanism. We will test this hypothesis by identifying metabolites and genes that
support Mtb growth when riboflavin biosynthesis is disrupted and determining whether riboflavin metabolites
are limiting for Mtb growth in the host. If our hypotheses are correct, we expect to identify novel aspects of Mtb
metabolite uptake and utilization and determine the feasibility of target riboflavin biosynthesis as drug targets in
vivo, with potential impcats for the study of metabolite transporters in other intracellular pathogens.

Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is a very common, monogenetic kidney
disorder, affecting approximately 300,000 Americans1, 2. ADPKD primarily results from mutations
in PKD1 and PKD23. The pathophysiology of ADPKD is incompletely understood and treatment
options are limited. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNA) – defined by a length >200 nucleotides and
absence of a long open reading frame – are a class of non-protein-coding RNAs implicated in a
range of disease4, 5. They have emerged as an exciting new drug target category for many
common conditions6. However, the role of lncRNAs in ADPKD has been understudied. In a recent
study, we found that the lncRNA Pvt1 is highly upregulated in mouse and humans with ADPKD7.
Pvt1 is a known oncogenic lncRNA that is overexpressed in many cancers and regulates Myc,
other transcription factors, and multiple miRNAs, some of which have major functions in ADPKD8-
11. The role of Pvt1 in ADPKD is not known. We developed a Pkd1-mutant mouse metanephric
organ culture (MOC) as a cost-effective model to manipulate gene expression and identify targets
that modulate cystogenesis7. We discovered that self-complementary adeno-associated virus
(scAAV), serotype DJ, is highly effective in transducing epithelial cells of the mouse MOC. We
used scAAV/DJ shRNA to knockdown Pvt1 in Pkd1-null MOCs. We noted that knockdown of Pvt1
markedly reduced cyst index and downregulated c-MYC protein levels in Pkd1-null kidneys.
Based on these promising findings, we propose the following aims: 1) test whether ablation of
Pvt1 ameliorates cystogenesis in mouse ADPKD, and 2) determine the contribution of PVT1 in
human ADPKD by silencing PVT1 in kidney organoids derived from PKD1-mutant hESCs. If
successful, results from this study will confirm pathogenic upregulation of PVT1 in-vivo ADPKD,
which will form the basis of R01 application.

Chronic pain is widespread in the adult population and inadequate pain control has a major negative impact on
the quality of life of chronic pain sufferers. Many currently available analgesics display modest efficacy and in
the case of opioids, addiction liability that has resulted in a dramatic increase in opioid abuse and addiction.
Consequently, there is an urgent need to identify novel targets for the development of non-opioid analgesics to
treat chronic pain. Our group has previously identified fatty acid binding protein 5 (FABP5) as an intracellular
carrier for endocannabinoids and structurally related N-acylethanolamines, whose inhibition augments tissue
levels of both lipid classes and produces analgesia. In the periphery, FABP5 inhibition additionally blunts the
release of pro-inflammatory and proalgesic mediators, positioning FABP5 as a promising target for the
development of analgesics. Accordingly, recently developed FABP5 inhibitors display efficacy in a range of pain
models and are rapidly advancing across the preclinical pipeline, with clinical testing scheduled to begin within
several years. Despite the therapeutic potential of FABP5 inhibition in treating pain, our understanding of its
mechanisms of action remains limited. While the majority of FABP5's effects originate from the modulation of
intracellular lipid transport and receptor activation, emerging evidence indicates that subsets of FABPs can be
released from distinct cell populations under specific conditions to exert unique biological functions. In this
application we test the novel hypothesis that inflammation triggers FABP5 secretion, which is instrumental in
delivering proalgesic lipids to nociceptive sensory neurons to maintain hyperalgesia. Conversely, sequestration
of extracellular FABP5 produces antinociceptive effects. Mechanistically, we hypothesize that FABP5 binds to
and delivers a lipid of the leukotriene family to its receptor, in turn sensitizing the nociceptive channels transient
receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) and transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) to sustain pain. Specific
Aim 1 tests the hypothesis that extracellular FABP5 modulates inflammatory pain hypersensitivity and will
interrogate the mechanisms underlying its cellular secretion. Specific Aim 2 tests the hypothesis that inhibition
of extracellular FABP5 or leukotriene signaling blunts inflammatory TRPA1 and TRPV1 sensitization. Specific
Aim 3 seeks to characterize the mechanisms underlying leukotriene-mediated TRPA1 sensitization. Successful
completion of the outlined aims will establish a novel paradigm linking extracellular FABP5 to pain modulation
and will provide a foundation for the development of analgesics targeting FABP5.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Summary
People with psychotic disorders die 10-20 years prematurely, often after years of disability and declining
health. Early-onset dementia is an important contributor to these problems. By age 65, 27% of people with
psychotic disorders are already diagnosed with dementia. The nature of this premature cognitive decline is
unclear, and RFA-MH-22-270 calls for studies to understand the increased risk of dementia in psychotic
disorders. Specifically, it is unknown when the cognitive decline takes place, why it happens, and what are its
functional consequences. The Suffolk County Mental Health Project, a longitudinal epidemiologic study of first-
episode psychosis that begun in 1989, provides an unparalleled opportunity to study cognitive decline in
psychotic disorder during midlife. The study enrolled 628 individuals with psychotic disorders. At Year 20, 261
demographically matched never-psychotic adults were added. The cohorts have been genotyped, and have
received comprehensive psychiatric evaluations, medical exams, physical performance tests, EEG, and
cognitive testing at regular intervals throughout the follow-up period. This created a rich dataset that has
already been the basis of over 115 publications. We propose a 35-year follow-up, when participants will be 65
years old on average (expected N = 530). The proposed study has four aims. First, we will determine whether
the cognitive decline from Year 20 to 35 is faster in cases than never-psychotic controls. Second, we will test if
Year 20 risk factors for cognitive change are the same in cases and controls (e.g., metabolic syndrome,
inactivity, tobacco use, low education, and APOE4) or some differ (e.g., antipsychotics, anticholinergics, and
schizophrenia polygenic risk score). Third, we will investigate in cases whether cognitive decline is associated
with worsening functioning in the real-world (role, social, and self-care), physical impairment, and neural
deficits (EEG and plasma markers). Fourth, we will explore dementia incidence in cases vs. controls and risk
factors for incident dementia. The proposed research will address scientific objectives highlighted in the RFA-
MH-22-270. First, it will explicate trajectories and outcomes of psychotic disorders in mid- to late-life by
studying cognitive and functional changes over 15 years (from mean age 50 to age 65). Second, it will identify
promising targets for future development of preventive interventions by investigating modifiable risk factors.
Third, it will shed light on mechanisms underpinning these trajectories by studying relevant genetic, molecular,
neural, environmental, and behavioral factors.

A significant proportion of individuals receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV-1 infection develop cognitive
deficits. This may be due solely to the HIV-1 infection; however, this may also indicate that prolonged ART itself
may contribute to the impairments, particularly in the context of HIV-1 infection. The latter possibility is of
particular concern given that a growing number of uninfected individuals use antiretrovirals (ARVs) as pre-
exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). The brain circuitry that may be affected by prolonged treatment with ARVs or by
ARVs in the context of HIV-1 infection is unknown.
We propose to apply our recently developed array of new tools for constructing, comparing, and analyzing 3D
whole-brain maps of neuronal activation in the mouse brain to reveal the critical neural circuitry affected by ARVs,
HIV-1 infection, and their combination. Our hypothesis is that 3D patterns of neuronal activation in animals
exposed to ARVs, HIV-1, and ARV/HIV-1 and involved in challenging behavioral tasks can both reveal the
crucial circuitry defining these effects and serve as unique signatures of the treatments' effects.
In specific aim 1, we will determine the critical shared components of neural circuitry affected by prolonged
exposure to select ARVs. We will generate mesoscopic global maps of neuronal activation in mice presented
with relevant cognitive challenges after exposure to ARVs. We will then subject the mapping datasets to our
stepwise selection pipeline to identify the critical brain regions and neural circuits altered by the treatments. In
specific aim 2, we will determine the components of neural circuitry in NOD-hIL-34 mice, a humanized animal
model of HIV-1 infection, that are affected by exposure to select ARVs in the context of infection. Finally, in
specific aim 3, we will validate and extend the conclusions of our in silico investigations: we will monitor neuronal
activity in the candidate regions in vivo on the single-cell and population levels; apply monosynaptic tracing to
determine whether ARV treatment induces long-term changes in neuronal connections; and use chemogenetics
to manipulate neuronal activity in the key components of the inferred circuitry. Our experiments will create a
circuitry map space for the action of ARVs in the context of HIV-1 infection, upon which other circuitry maps that
describe various behavioral states and responses to treatments can be projected and compared. Our results will
help to characterize cognitive impairments in HIV-1 infected individuals receiving ART and in those using ARVs
as PrEP, and will inform future therapeutic efforts to treat HIV-associated neurocognitive impairment.

Long-term memories are often formed when the event involves a threat and triggers survival behavior. Sensory cues present
during the threat tend to elicit defensive behaviors when they occur in the future, indicating that a long-term association has
formed between the cue and the threat. While it is known for decades that the transformation of associative memories from
labile state to long-term form requires new protein synthesis in discrete brain regions, there is a knowledge gap in the
understanding of specific neural pathways that are recruited during memory consolidation and the mechanisms that control
the dynamics of protein synthesis in these pathways. This knowledge is important not only for gaining a deeper
understanding of spatiotemporally resolved protein synthesis in memory processes but also for targeted therapeutic
intervention in disorders of emotional memories such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). PTSD is characterized by
over-consolidation of memory about the traumatic event, inability to discriminate innocuous stimuli from ones that predict
danger, and maladaptive coping strategies. Using Pavlovian and instrumental threat conditioning paradigms in mice, this
proposal aims to understand the neurobiological substrates for the modulation of emotional memories by threat intensity
and volitional control – both of which are disrupted in PTSD. Two key modes for protein synthesis, namely the eukaryotic
initiation factor 2 (eIF2) and eIF4E-dependent translation, are thought to be crucial for associative emotional memories.
The proposed study will use bidirectional strategies to regulate these modes of translation in specific prefrontal pathways
connecting with deep brain regions, including the basolateral amygdala and paraventricular thalamus. Furthermore, this
work will survey learning-induced physiological changes in the brain at the level of cellular-resolution molecular signaling.
Finally, the study plans to determine the changes in the translation landscape in specific prefrontal pathways during the
consolidation of diverse emotional memories that result in cue-elicited freezing or avoidance. To achieve these goals, mouse
models will be used in combination with viral-mediated gene transfer, chemogenetics, pharmacology, imaging, molecular
profiling, and behavior. Findings from this study have the potential to transform the field of memory research by elucidating
the molecular players that govern the consolidation of long-term memories in both healthy and diseased brain states.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Inputting and editing text on smartphones play an important role in people’s daily lives. Studies have
shown that they constitute 40% of one’s smartphone usage. For blind smartphone users, text input and text
editing tasks remain a challenge with studies showing that their typing speed is only 4-5 Words Per Minute
(WPM) on soft keyboards compared to 36 WPM of sighted users. While the use of voicing text input is
becoming prevalent among blind users, studies have shown that they spend 80% of their time on the average
editing spoken text, which is a slow, laborious process. This lack of efficient and convenient text input and
editing methods can make it difficult for blind users to use their smartphones proficiently and productively
for their everyday activities such as staying informed, connecting with friends and colleagues, shopping,
entertainment, travel, and for just about everything.
 This project will research and develop a new generation of intelligent text input and editing methods
that will substantially enhance the proficiency with which blind smartphone users can input and edit text.
To this end, the project has three overarching objectives: First, we will create a non-visual free-form gesture
input method that will enable blind users to enter a word or phrase with free-form touch gestures on the
default Qwerty soft keyboard on smartphones, rather than entering text one letter at a time, an arguably
slow process. It will bring the popular gesture typing method to blind users, and increase their text input
efficiency as it will eliminate the need to confirm each letter during text input. Second, we will create an
intelligent Braille soft keyboard that can automatically correct input errors and do auto-completion of
unseen letters, which until now has been unavailable for Braille. Auto-correction has been shown to reduce
the input errors by over 30% for typing on a Qwerty soft keyboard for sighted users, and introducing it to
Braille soft keyboards would result in an even greater error reduction as touch inputs of blind users are far
more error-prone. Third, we will leverage language models in combination with voicing and touch to
eliminate the tedious operations required by extant methods that rely exclusively on precise cursor
movements for editing erroneous text input, which can occur quite often with spoken text input. Based on
previous studies with sighted users that show a 30-40% gain in editing performance with this approach, we
expect even greater performance gains with blind users as cursor-based operations are far more challenging
for them. Successful accomplishments of these objectives will eliminate any barriers to productivity of
blind smartphone users and empower them to utilize the power and connectivity of these devices to fully
participate in this digitized economy as critical services are increasingly delivered via smartphone devices.

present in tick saliva, injected into the skin during a 15-minute tick bite and causes a 10% fatal encephalitis
resulting in severe long-term neurologic damage in 50% of patients. The incidence of POWV encephalitis in
the elderly remains an enigma with mechanisms of POWV neuroinvasion, CNS cell targeting and
neuroinflammatory pathology, virtually unknown. To reflect POWV spread from skin to the CNS, POWV (LI9)
was isolated from deer ticks directly in epithelial cells. Mice s.c. inoculated with POWV LI9 develop lethal
neurovirulent disease with overt murine brain damage. Noting lethality in older mice, neurovirulence was
assessed as a function of age and found LI9 to be lethal in 90% of 50 wk, and <10% of 10 wk, old C57/Bl6
mice, and consistent with POWV neurovirulence in the elderly. Brains of 50 wk old mice had dramatically
increased viremia, chemokines, immune cell infiltrates and histopathology. LI9 was passage attenuated in IFN
deficient VeroE6 cells and the resulting virus, LI9-P, fails to cause murine disease and protects mice from LI9
challenge. This POWV pair provides a means of defining neurovirulence mechanisms.
 Mechanisms of POWV entry into the CNS remain to be revealed but are likely to be via hematogenous
blood-brain-barrier (BBB) or blood-CSF-barrier (BCSFB) portals. BBB and BCSFBs are distinct and
respectively formed by brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs) and choroid plexus epithelial cells
(CPEpCs). CPEpCs are uniquely responsive to IFNλ, and the BCSFB is the main immune cell gateway into the
CNS. In aged mice upregulated inflammatory IL-1β and IL1R responses are found in choroid plexus cells and
suggest potential mechanisms of age-dependent neuroinflammation.
 POWV LI9 infects CPEPCs and BMECs and regulates IFN responses in vitro. In mice LI9 directed CNS
viremia was dramatically inhibited by post-infection IFNλ treatment. In contrast to LI9, LI9-P highly induces
IFNβ/λ in infected CPEpCs, and failure to regulate IFN responses may explain LI9-P attenuation in mice. These
findings rationalize POWV entry into the CNS via BBB or BCSFB portals, and IFNλ as a key regulator of LI9
neuroinvasion and pathogenesis.
 To define mechanisms of LI9 neurovirulence and LI9-P attenuation a recombinant approach for generating
infectious POWVs and chimeras of LI9 and LI9-P was developed. Studies proposed use single cell RNA
sequencing (scRNAseq), model BBB and BCSFBs and brain slice culture to define CNS cells targeted by
POWVs and mechanisms of LI9 neuroinvasion. Proposed studies analyze cell responses that permit POWV
neuroinvasion and define age-dependent neurovirulence mechanisms using neurovirulent LI9, attenuated LI9-
P and POWV mutants. Findings are likely to reveal responses that direct or restrict CNS damage, and targets
for preventing POWV neurovirulence that may be broadly applicable to other neurovirulent viruses.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：The human fungal pathogen C. albicans causes life-threatening systemic infections and severe
morbidity from mucosal infections. Morphology switching between budding and filamentous growth
is central to C. albicans pathogenesis. The transition to hyphal growth makes C. albicans a more
aggressive pathogen that can infect a broad range of host niches by crossing epithelial and
endothelial barriers and growing invasively into tissues. However, most previous research has
focused on identifying upstream regulators and genes that promote hyphal growth in liquid culture,
which are often not important in vivo. Therefore, little is known about the mechanisms that directly
promote invasive growth of C. albicans in the host. To address this gap, a genetic screen was
used to identify mutants that are strongly defective in invasive growth. The proposed studies will
focus on three sets of these mutants that revealed new mechanisms that are critical for invasion.
Aim 1 will focus on mutants that identified an important role for endocytosis in invasive growth in
vitro and in vivo. These studies are expected to reveal which stages of endocytosis are important
and how they promote plasma membrane organization that is needed for invasive growth. Aim 2
will focus on two other newly discovered functions that mediate novel mechanisms for invasion.
One new function is carried out by Pxl1, which is similar to paxillin proteins that bind stressed actin
filaments to mediate mechano-sensing in mammalian cells. The pxl1D mutant will be investigated
to determine how it plays a role in sensing the surrounding matrix and mediating invasive growth.
The other new function needed for invasive growth involves pathways that regulate trafficking of v-
SNAREs, which are needed for secretion. Defining the role of these trafficking pathways will be
significant because polarized secretion is fundamentally important for hyphal growth. The new
mechanisms will be tested in mouse models of oropharyngeal candidiasis and bloodstream-
disseminated candidiasis to determine how invasive growth is regulated at these very different
sites. Identifying the mechanisms that promote C. albicans invasive growth will create new
avenues for the development of therapeutic approaches.

Visual perception and visually-guided behavior relies on the ability of the brain to combine information about
multiple aspects of a visual scene. In all sighted animals, including humans, the visual system uses parallel
processing strategies to represent different features of a visual scene in different visual pathways or populations of
neurons. How, then, does the brain combine information about these different aspects of the visual world into a
unified visual percept, and how do animals guide behavior based on multiple visual cues that are encoded by
separate pathways? The research performed under this award will answer this question using the visual system of
the fruit fly Drosophila as a model, which allows for the identification and targeting of precise, defined neural
populations that represent visual cues. This work will: (1) Determine how diverse visual features are jointly
represented by populations of visual projection neurons that carry information from the visual system to the rest
of the brain, (2) Determine how interactions among these visual projection pathways shape the visual information
encoded in them, and (3) Determine how different features of a scene are combined to guide animal behavior. This
work will advance the core mission of the National Eye Institute by making contributions to the understanding of
visual function. This research will rely on a wide array of modern approaches in neuroscience, including functional
imaging of brain activity, genetic manipulations, computational and statistical modeling, and behavioral
measurements. In addition to the research described above, this award will support the awardee’s transition to an
independent research career at a research-intensive university and further support the establishment of their visual
neuroscience laboratory.

The spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are a genetically heterogeneous group of rare, dominantly inherited
neurological disorders characterized by progressive ataxia. Although the genetic causes of SCAs are diverse,
multiple SCAs (1,2,3,6,7 & 12) are caused by CAG expansion mutations and they share the production of CAG
expansion RNAs and in most cases, the expression of toxic polyglutamine containing proteins. Despite these
shared features, there are no cross-disease therapeutic approaches for these disorders, and we lack a clear
understanding of the precise molecular mechanisms responsible for disease pathogenesis. Our central
hypothesis is that targeting CAG expansions with small molecules will provide therapeutic efficacy across
multiple SCAs. To test this hypothesis, we leveraged our extensive experience from developing small molecules
that target CUG expansion RNAs in myotonic dystrophy (DM). We generated a CAG expansion reporter cell line
with an integrated (CAG)60 lacking genomic context of any SCA gene. Using this cell line, we have identified
small molecules that selectively reduce levels of CAG transcripts across SCA1, SCA3 and SCA7 patient-derived
fibroblasts and SCA1 mice providing proof-of-concept for a cross-disease small molecule approach for CAG
expansion SCAs. In this study, we will leverage our CAG screening system and established pipeline to identify
FDA-approved small molecules and natural products with therapeutic efficacy across CAG SCAs. Interestingly,
transcriptomic characterization of our CAG reporter line identified gene expression signatures that are also found
in SCA mouse models, as well as widespread alternative splicing dysregulation. Changes in alternative splicing
are a molecular feature for many repeat expansion diseases including DM, suggesting alternative splicing may
be a novel CAG-dependent transcriptomic hallmark of SCAs. Indeed, we identified widespread alternative
splicing in SCA patient-derived fibroblasts and published RNA-Seq data from across CAG SCA mouse models,
including presymptomatic animals. In DM, specific mis-spliced events are directly connected with disease
outcomes and can be used as target engagement biomarkers for lead candidate prioritization in preclinical
therapy studies. We propose that dysregulation of alternative splicing provides a missing link between
presymptomatic transcriptional changes and dysregulation of key cellular pathways in CAG expansion SCAs. To
address this, we propose to identify alternative splicing events that contribute to disease onset and neuronal
dysfunction in the human neuronal context and to assess the feasibility of measuring alternative splicing
dysregulation and rescue to aid in cross CAG SCA lead compound prioritization. Together these studies will
identify novel, clinic-ready CAG selective compounds and will help to accelerate these compounds towards
clinical testing as well as identifying novel therapeutic targets that may serve as the basis for future investigations.
This work will have broad implications for therapeutic development and our understanding of disease across
CAG SCAs, non-CAG SCAs, CAG repeat diseases and the broad class of microsatellite expansion disorders.

Powassan virus (family Flaviviridae) is a reemerging tickborne virus endemic in North America and Russia. In
1997, a POWV-like agent was isolated from Ixodes scapularis in New England and determined to be genetically
distinct from the original human isolate. This revealed the existence of two lineages: lineage I, POWV (POWV
L1) and lineage II, deer tick virus (POWV L2). POWV L1 is maintained between I. cookei and woodchucks and
I. marxi and arboreal squirrels, while POWV L2 is maintained in I. scapularis and small mammalian hosts. This
distinction suggests an evolutionary progression of either POWV L1 or L2 into unique transmission cycles and
subsequent adaption to these new hosts. Tick, mammalian, and human isolates from New York State (NYS) are
typically identified as POWV L2, but for the first time in 45 years three POWV L1 isolates were detected including
isolations from I. cookei and the first known isolation of POWV L1 from I. scapularis. Additionally, within the same
timeframe in NYS, POWV L1 was identified in Dermacentor variabilis and POWV L2 in Amblyomma
americanum. With few available isolates, especially POWV L1, little work has been done to elucidate genetic
correlates that confer tick host specificity or the role of tick host responses in driving host-specific adaptation.
Therefore, the goal of this study is to utilize our emergent POWV isolates to understand genetic
correlates of tick host specificity and to investigate the potential for further adaptation to distinct tick
hosts. My previous work suggests introduction of POWV L1 into new tick hosts like I. scapularis facilitates viral
diversification and emergence of host-driven adaptations in proteins involved in immune evasion and replication.
Therefore, I hypothesize introduction of POWV L1 into distinct tick species leads to emergence of tick-specific
substitutions that contribute to increased viral fitness. Additionally, I hypothesize these changes will be tick
specific with distinct adaptation of POWV occurring dependent on tick species. To test this, I propose to:
AIM 1: Investigate the role of tick-driven, emergent substitutions in NS4b on viral fitness using a novel
POWV L1 infectious clone
AIM 2: perform experimental evolution of POWV in distinct tick species: Ixodes scapularis, Dermacentor
variabilis, and Amblyomma americanum to assess changes in viral diversity and describe tick antiviral
responses to POWV
These studies will help further our understanding of POWV adaptation to novel hosts and host-specific, genetic
correlates that influence viral fitness. Additionally, these studies will contribute to the poorly understood tick
antiviral responses to POWV infection. Overall, this work may act as a model for tickborne virus spread and
establishment in new transmission cycles.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
Our long-term goal is to prevent blindness, either by interfering with disease progression or by developing cell
replacement therapies to restore vision. We believe that microRNAs (miRNAs) are a very powerful and innovative
tool to accomplish this, but we first need to identify the set of miRNAs required for retinal cell fate specification
and proper cell function in the developing retina. These miRNAs might represent potential therapeutic agents to
not only restore imbalances that occur with the onset of retinal disorders, but also to induce specific cell fates for
Müller glia (MG) reprogramming. We therefore propose to investigate the role of retinal progenitor cell (RPC)-
miRNAs for late-stage RPC state and function and MG reprogramming by Aim 1: identifying the specific miRNAs
required in early postnatal development, when rod photoreceptors (PR), bipolar cells (BCs), and MG are
generated. Aim 2: testing miRNAs to reprogram MG into functional retinal neurons with focus on BCs and rod
PR. We propose to use a mouse line that will not be able to produce miRNAs in their RPCs to better understand
the function of miRNAs in retinal development and diseases. We will analyze tissue and cells with regard to
morphological and functional alterations and determine which miRNAs are responsible for changes in cellular
behavior. If we discover certain cell types that do not form properly without miRNAs, this could mean that specific
miRNAs are required for proper development of that cell type. Rescue experiments will show whether disturbed
tissue can be restored by miRNA supplementation and would imply potential therapeutic use. These miRNAs
might also be new, additional reprogramming factors to regenerate specific cell types from stem cells or MG. My
previous work has shown that miRNAs can reprogram MG into neuronal-like cells similar to BCs. However,
whether these reprogrammed neurons are functional, and whether other neurons are generated, is still unknown.
To address these questions, we will reprogram primary MG from reporter mice to visualize the conversion of MG
into RPCs and neuronal-like cells, use patch clamp to measure ion currents, and profile their gene expression.
miRNA candidates that successfully converted MG into functional neurons will be tested subsequently in 3D
organotypic cultures (intact retinas outside the organism). Explants will be treated with miRNAs and evaluated
with regard to cell proliferation and proper differentiation capability. miRNA candidates that can induce MG
reprogramming ex vivo will be utilized for in vivo reprogramming approaches. To reveal underlying mechanisms
and true miRNAs targets, we will use target prediction and target validation tools to narrow down and test
selected candidates via sensors (in vitro proof of miRNA:mRNA prediction) and rescue experiments. This work
provides a comprehensive study of miRNAs by combining molecular and cellular analyses with functional testing,
in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo and will reveal (1) the set miRNAs required for proper retinal development and cell
fate specification of late-born retinal neurons and (2) the set of miRNAs that can reprogram MG into functional
neurons.

This proposal presents a four-year Research Career Development program focused on
understanding the mechanisms by which myopia increases glaucoma susceptibility. The
candidate is currently a Clinical Instructor/PhD candidate with 80% protected research time, who
was the first to complete the combined Residency/PhD program at the SUNY College of
Optometry. The proposal builds on the candidate’s previous clinical and research experience in
ocular disease, myopia, and glaucoma, and integrates her mentors’ unique fields of expertise.
Under the guidance of her primary mentor and co-mentors Drs. Alexandra Benavente-Perez,
Stewart Bloomfield, Miduturu Srinivas and Suresh Viswanathan, she will gain a deeper
understanding of cellular and electrophysiology methodologies applied to this proposal. The
research plan proposed will provide a distinctive set of multidisciplinary skills to develop the
candidate into an independent investigator in the translational research field of myopic
complications, in particular glaucoma.
Myopia is projected to become a public health crisis that will affect half the world population by
2050, and is characterized by excessive eye growth that can affect the structure and function of
vital cells that form the retinal neurovascular unit. Glaucoma is a multifactorial blinding disease
estimated to affect more than 120 million people worldwide by 2040. While strong evidence
confirms that myopic patients are at higher risk of glaucomatous degeneration, the mechanisms
behind this association are unknown. Our current understanding of this relationship has two major
gaps: 1) the longitudinal effect that myopic eye growth and stretch have on the cellular structure
and function of ganglion cells, glia and vasculature remains unknown, and 2) there are no non-
human primate (NHP) animal models that combine myopia and glaucoma to study how myopic
progression predisposes the retina to glaucomatous remodeling. I hypothesize that myopia and
glaucoma are linked via the effect that myopic stretch has on the neurovascular unit. The overall
goals of this proposal are to define the longitudinal effect that myopia has on 1) retinal ganglion
cells, 2) astrocytes and 3) associated vasculature, and their relationship with glaucoma
susceptibility. This proposal is innovative because it focuses on studying longitudinally three key
neurovascular elements affected by myopia, using a novel NHP experimental model with anatomy
and physiology comparable to the human eye, and induced with myopia and subsequently
glaucoma. This research will have a direct positive impact and is significant because it is expected
to provide strong evidence of the unknown nature of the myopia-glaucoma relationship.

In addition to its pivotal roles in regulating cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, DNA repair, and metabolism, the p53
tumor suppressor has been demonstrated to modulate innate immune and adaptive immune responses through
its crosstalk with key regulators of immune signaling pathways. The dysregulation of Interleukin 17 (IL17)
cytokine family and its receptors has been associated with many human diseases, notably inflammation and
cancer, crediting to their crucial roles in normal host immune responses. Particularly, Interleukin 17 Receptor B
(IL17RB) has been found to be overexpressed in various cancers through the activation of NFB, AKT, or ERK
signaling to promote tumorigenesis. Our preliminary results indicate that IL17RB is a p53 repression target and
repression of IL17RB sustains the p53 response. Additionally, activation of p53 by nutlin-3a or IL17RB depletion
decreases the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokine IL8 induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The goal of
this application is to study the role of p53-mediated IL17RB repression in tumor suppression and inflammation
inhibition. We established systems of IL17RB repression, overexpression, and activation, that will enable
biochemical and cellular characterization as well as in-depth gene expression analyses to elucidate the
contribution of IL17RB repression to tumor suppressive and inflammation inhibitory function of p53. The
proposed work will not only allow us to gain a better understanding on how IL17RB links p53’s crosstalk with
other signaling pathways and how p53 attenuates oncogenic effects of chronic inflammation through repressing
IL17RB, but also provide a mechanistic basis for the development of novel anti-cancer strategies as well as
inflammation inhibitors. In addition, this project will enhance the research environment at St. John’s University
by providing undergraduate and graduate students with numerous opportunities to learn the fundamentals of
biomedical research.

 The patient-clinician interaction is central to most therapies and is supported by key interpersonal
mechanisms of action such as clinician empathy, therapeutic alliance, and trust. However, the neural
underpinnings of this effect are mostly unknown. Our recently published study applied functional MRI (fMRI)
hyperscanning (i.e. simultaneously neuroimaging chronic pain patients and clinicians in synchronized MRI
scanners) demonstrated that brain-to-brain concordance in the temporoparietal junction (TPJ) is up-regulated
following a clinical interaction and associated with patient analgesia. Our study also found that greater facial
expression mirroring is associated with higher therapeutic alliance and greater evoked pain analgesia.
Interestingly, the TPJ is known to be a key region for theory-of-mind processing (ToM, i.e. mentalizing,
perspective-taking), defined as the ability to infer and understand others’ mental states - a cognitive function
critical for social communication, empathy, and social mirroring. Furthermore, ToM training protocols have
been found to improve mentalizing ability, which can generalize to other cognitive / quality of life functions. We
propose that patient/clinician TPJ concordance, linked with ToM processing, is a key aspect of therapeutic
alliance, and thus ToM training for fibromyalgia patients will increase alliance, facial expression mirroring, and
TPJ concordance, with the latter mediating improvements in pain outcomes following acupuncture therapy, an
established non-pharmacological therapy for chronic pain. Fibromyalgia is a nociplastic chronic pain disorder
showing a deficit in ToM processing, potentially contributing to the difficulties in social functioning
characterizing this condition, and in great need of novel therapies. Our study will evaluate the impact of a novel
multimodal therapy, a type of approach known to improve pain outcomes and recommended by the Institute of
Medicine report for chronic pain management. Our study design will also allow us to evaluate a neural model
supporting therapeutic alliance for pain outcomes for fibromyalgia wherein combined ToM training and
acupuncture will synergistically target a critical therapeutic pathway - i.e., patient-provider alliance, instantiated
by TPJ concordance. Our Aims will: (1) Determine behavioral and neurophysiological effects of ToM training,
(2) Evaluate the impact of ToM training on brain-to-brain concordance with fMRI hyperscanning, and (3)
Assess if brain/behavioral markers mediate the effect of ToM training on longitudinal acupuncture outcomes.

Skeletal muscle has a remarkable regenerative capability when the extent of the injury is relatively minor.
However, following traumatic muscle injuries such as volumetric muscle loss (VML), the endogenous repair
potential of skeletal muscle becomes inadequate, which causes physical disability and adversely influences the
quality of life. Biomaterial scaffolds hold great promise for improving the functional recovery of skeletal muscle
by providing both physical and biochemical cues to facilitate cell adhesion, migration, proliferation, and
differentiation. Particularly, acellular scaffolds are promising and clinically transformative as they obviate
limitations associated with using exogenous cells, including limited sources and immunogenicity. However,
existing acellular bioscaffolds have failed to induce the formation of a sufficient amount of de novo myofibers
and achieve appreciable muscle functional improvement, limitations that have been largely attributed to the poor
ability of acellular scaffolds to recruit endogenous cells, especially muscle stem cells (MuSCs). Therefore,
developing an acellular scaffold capable of active cell recruitment represents a major technological advance in
the treatment of VML. Inspired by the native tissues such as skin that generate electrical signals to guide cell
migration during injury repair, we propose to develop a biodegradable piezoelectric scaffold comprised of a fibrin-
based hydrogel containing boron nitride nanotubes (fibrin/BNNTs). Our scaffold is designed to convert
mechanical stimuli (e.g., via ultrasound and exercise-induced muscle contraction) to electrical signals with the
goal of promoting cell recruitment. In this proposal, we will test our central hypothesis that, upon ultrasound
stimulation, fibrin/BNNTs piezoelectric scaffolds enhance endogenous cell recruitment and MuSC differentiation,
thus accelerating the functional recovery of skeletal muscle after VML. Two specific aims are proposed to test
our central hypothesis. Specific Aim 1 studies will optimize the fibrin/BNNTs scaffold composition and ultrasound
stimulation to promote MuSC recruitment and myogenic differentiation in vitro using a novel 3D VML muscle
construct model. In Specific Aim 2, using our validated VML male and female mouse models, we will evaluate
the ability of ultrasound-stimulated piezoelectric scaffolds to promote in vivo skeletal muscle regeneration, and
we will evaluate whether these effects are sex-dependent. We anticipate that the successful completion of these
studies will not only offer a promising new strategy for enhancing skeletal muscle regeneration but also provide
novel insights into scaffold design for other applications, such as skin and cardiac regeneration.

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive, neurodegenerative condition that impacts 44 million people globally.
It is the most common cause of dementia—accounting for 80% of all dementia diagnoses—and predominantly
affects older people. To date, AD has no cure. Thus, it is imperative to diagnose patients as early as possible to
maximize the efficacy of symptom management strategies. However, existing AD diagnostic and monitoring
options remain subpar, leaving urgent need for sensitive, reliable, and convenient methods to measure AD.
New research suggests that electroencephalography (EEG) -based biomarkers can assess neural degeneration
caused by AD long before tissue loss or behavioral symptoms appear. SPARK Neuro aims to unlock the full
potential of EEG through a novel software platform: SPARK Scan. Combining EEG with the capabilities of
machine learning, SPARK Scan better assesses cognitive health and neurodegeneration, aiding the diagnosis
of AD. In the proposed Direct-to-Phase II SBIR project, the company will enhance the existing SPARK platform
by developing a novel Alzheimer’s Disease Pathology Index that tracks patient amyloid and tau burden.
Developed with CSF data collected from Johns Hopkins University, the Pathology Index will be a continuous
score that corresponds to a patient’s pathological disease burden. After updating the software, the SPARK team
will employ Human Factors testing to enhance the usability and utility of the updated platform and clinical report
before submitting findings for FDA De Novo approval. This work will progress the SPARK platform by providing
a granular measure of AD-related pathology, extending beyond current capabilities.

In Nigeria, cancer is a significant and growing public health threat. Given the rising incidence and poor
outcomes associated with cancer in the region, the Nigerian Ministry of Health has designated cancer
as a priority area for research and training. To support this, we propose a new training program – the
Nigerian Cancer Research Training (NCAT) program – with the goal of increasing capacity for cancer
research in Nigeria. We seek to not only strengthen the existing research enterprise but to build in-
country expertise and provide a solid foundation for the development, implementation, and
dissemination of evidence-based interventions that will impact public health policy, as well as clinical
practice, care, and treatment for cancer patients. The NCAT program will build on existing relationships
and infrastructure established over the past decade between Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center
(MSK) in the US, Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU) in Nigeria, and the College of Medicine/Lagos
University Teaching Hospital (CMUL/LUTH) in Nigeria. We will employ a multi-level approach to
strengthen research capacity for individuals (Aim 1) and institutions (Aim 2), while also enhancing
broader relationships at national, regional, and global levels (Aim 3). The NCAT program will address
two distinct needs for cancer research training in Nigeria: 1. a training program that can be used for
clinical faculty (primarily physicians and nurses) that will not interfere with clinical/research duties, and
2. a training program to bolster the capacity of full-time PhD-level researchers in the disciplines of
cancer epidemiology, behavioral sciences, and biostatistics. Trainees will be competitively selected,
and we will emphasize diversity and underrepresented specialties (e.g., nursing, psycho-oncology). A
multi-pronged training approach, utilizing coursework, “hands-on” research in ongoing breast and
colorectal cancer studies, virtual learning, mentorship, and collaboration will be used to train a cadre of
multidisciplinary Nigerian cancer researchers. After a one-year cancer research training period, NCAT
trainees will be grouped into research teams and take part in team science-based training, which will
include designing and conducting a collaborative mentored pilot research project in Nigeria. In addition,
to enhance support for local researchers beyond the project period, we will develop cancer research
training courses to be used in Nigeria, and provide mentorship and training to research administration
offices at OAU and CMUL/LUTH. We will use multiple layers of trainee and project assessment to
ensure that our program is meeting its ultimate goal of creating well-trained colorectal and breast cancer
researchers and a sustainable pipeline for continued cancer research in Nigeria.

 During mammalian development, a single cell gives rise to thousands of diverse and functionally
distinct cell-types. Understanding how each cell-type is determined during development is one of the central
questions in biology with far-reaching consequences for human health and regenerative medicine. While much
of our current understanding of how cell-fate decisions are made is based on either temporally-resolved and
non-destructive methods (e.g., time-lapse microscopy) or high-throughput but destructive genomic assays
(e.g., single-cell RNA-seq), a new method that allows continual observation of each cell throughout the
developmental process will fill the major gaps existing in our understanding of cell-fate transitions during
mammalian development.
 Here we propose to develop molecular recording methods that enable the concurrent, non-destructive,
high-throughput measurements of past cellular events and the current cell-type. Our recent methods, DNA
Typewriter and ENGRAM, use precision genome editing to record cell lineage information and key
transcriptional signaling events to the cell’s genome, which are recovered along with the transcriptome at the
single-cell level. During the mentored K99 phase, I will further improve our methods by increasing the lineage
recording efficiency (Aim 1) and testing it in the synthetic mammalian embryo systems (Aim 2). After I
transition to independence in the R00 phase, I will expand the molecular recorder platform to concurrently
capture diverse key cellular events (Aim 3). As our preliminary data on DNA Typewriter and ENGRAM
demonstrate, we are in a strong position to carry out described molecular recording in model development
systems. We anticipate that molecular recording of lineage and key signaling events in the synthetic embryo
systems will deepen our model of early mammalian development. Together, our proposal will serve as a strong
foundation as I transition into my independence and continue developing a general molecular recording
platform.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is one of the earliest and most noticeable symptoms associated with
Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) and other AD Related Dementias (ADRD). There is no cure for ADRD, and
conventional treatments only target more disease stages. Notably, MCI associated with AD typically occurs after
AD biomarkers (related to β-amyloid and tau pathologies) are detectable in patients, creating a narrow window
prior to MCI-AD onset and diagnosis, termed preclinical AD, where interventions slowing MCI onset have the
potential to greatly improve patient quality of life and dramatically reduce costs of AD care at large. However,
developing pharmaceutical treatments for preclinical AD must meet high safety margins given the duration of
treatment, and past attempts have failed to show efficacy. Recently, approvals of antidepressants like ketamine
and brexanolone (both 2019) and the resurgence of psychedelic research has highlighted the power of
neuroplasticity modifiers – compounds driving the creation or modulation of synaptic connections within the brain
– for modifying neurological function to impact mental health. Engaging neuroplasticity mechanisms through
pharmacological means or holistic approaches (i.e. exercise & dietary changes) has been shown to positively
enhance cognition and memory. Notably, some of the most potent neuroplasticity modulators are Natural
Products (NPs) derived from medicinal plants and herbs used by humans for centuries. As such, NPs have been
the subject of numerous studies investigating their potential to improve cognition and progression to MCI in AD.
However, incomplete descriptions of NP molecular targets, mechanisms of action, stability, purity, potency and
bioavailability have largely prevented their development as clinical drug candidates. What’s more, the quantity
of known NPs found in botanical products numbers in the tens of thousands. To identify and develop
psychoactive natural products that impact neuroplasticity and can slow MCI onset, Sensorium Therapeutics is
expanding the capacity of their Biodynamic Discovery PlatformTM (BDP). Our novel BDPTM leverages AI-assisted
analysis of ethnobotanical data and medicinal chemistry coupled with in vitro high-throughput screening using
human iPSCs to provide an effective drug development pipeline for identifying novel NPs as MCI-AD treatments.
Our platform has already led to the identification of a leading natural product drug candidate for depression and
anxiety. Additionally, we have identified a class of botanically-derived alkaloid compounds that have favorable
CNS pharmacological profiles, excellent chemical and in vitro safety, and are linked to improving cognitive
function in humans. The overarching goal of this Fast Track proposal is to expand our BDPTM to include scalable
cellular/neuronal readouts of neuroplasticity while incorporating MCI-AD in vitro models (Phase I) and identify
and validate NP candidate efficacy for MCI-AD treatment (Phase II). Successful completion of this Fast Track
project will generate NP candidates for further development and demonstrate efficacy for Sensorium’s
Biodynamic Discovery PlatformTM in identifying lead candidates for MCI-AD treatments.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：We propose to develop rectal cancer organoids (tumoroids) as
individualized models and to build a large rectal cancer tumoroid repository. Research on rectal cancers is
hampered by the paucity of models. Of the few existing in vivo models of rectal cancer, none place the tumors
in the rectal lumen, so the models fail to mimic the correct anatomic environment and local invasion. The
existing models also have not been observed to metastasize. Another problem is that we lack accurate means
to predict whether individual rectal cancer patients will respond to chemotherapy or radiation, both of which are
part of the current standard of care. We believe that both the paucity of models and the lack of predictive tools
can be addressed by patient-derived tumoroids. Tumoroids can be grown in 3-dimensional culture ex vivo or
implanted into mice, so they offer a flexible research platform. In preliminary results, we have derived tumoroid
lines from multiple patients' rectal cancers and found them to resemble the corresponding patient tumors. The
tumoroids, when implanted in mice endoluminally (i.e. in the rectum), formed locally invasive tumors capable of
metastasis. Moreover, we found tumoroids to have clinically relevant responses to chemotherapy and
radiation. Thus, drawing from these preliminary data, we hypothesize that rectal cancer tumoroids mirror the
traits of their original tumors, can be used to predict patients' response to therapy, and, when implanted
endoluminally into mice, can serve as an optimal model of rectal cancer.
We plan to develop 100 new tumoroids, which we expect to encompass much of the diversity of human rectal
adenocarcinoma. The tumoroids will be analyzed in ex vivo culture and in two mouse models: the endoluminal
implantation model and a conventional flank injection model. In these settings, we will test whether the
tumoroid accurately reflects its tumor of origin in terms of mutations, histology, and gene expression. We will
determine whether response of the tumoroids to patient-specific chemotherapy and radiation can predict the
corresponding patient's response. Of particular interest is whether individual human rectal cancers are more
accurately modeled by endoluminal implantation than by flank injection. Finally, to integrate our findings into a
comprehensive platform for broad use, we will develop a rectal cancer tumoroid biorepository seamlessly
integrated with online pathologic, genomic, and model-specific information. The online platform will be built
within our institution's cancer genomics portal, then integrated into the NCIP Hub. We have assembled a
collaborative team with expertise in colorectal surgical oncology, radiation oncology, and pathology; organoids;
mouse models; biostatistics; and bioinformatics. We anticipate that the proposed research will credential
tumoroids as accurate models for rectal cancer research and for predicting patient responses to therapy. The
large tumoroid biorepository is likely to stimulate research on new treatments for rectal cancer. The ultimate
result will be new treatment options and better treatment selection for patients affected by this deadly disease.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：The prognosis of HPV+ oropharyngeal cancer (OPC) treated with standard radiation at 70 Gy is excellent.
However, 80% of these patients experience grade ≥2 mucositis and 30% have permanent swallowing
dysfunction. Clinical data suggest that 70 Gy may be overtreatment for some HPV+ OPCs. A modest
reduction of 10-16 Gy for an unselected cohort with HPV+ OPC showed a 2-year progression-free survival
(PFS) of 80%, but 40% of patients still had difficulty swallowing at 1 year. The proposed research will employ
imaging (PET/MRI) biomarkers to identify patients with HPV+ OPC who may benefit from a major dose
reduction to 30 Gy, a dose based on experience in HPV+ anal cancer, with the goal of maintaining tumor
control and cure while substantially reducing treatment-related toxicity. A pilot trial of 19 HPV+ OPC patients
treated at 30 Gy followed by neck dissection was encouraging, with a 2-year PFS of 93%. Significant toxicity
reduction was observed. The proposed research will expand on the initial findings of the proof- of-principle
study to a larger cohort of patients. The proposed imaging metrics to select patients for major dose de-
escalation will include baseline and early intra-treatment [18F]-FMISO PET imaging, which will provide
information on tumor hypoxia, a marker of radioresistance (Aim 1). Eligible patients will have no evidence of
hypoxia on baseline imaging or have resolution of hypoxia during treatment, which will portend tumor
radiosensitivity. We will interrogate the tumor microenvironment (Aim 2) by deriving quantitative imaging
biomarkers (QIBs) from multi-parametric diffusion-weighted MRI (DW-MRI) consisting of non-Gaussian
intravoxel incoherent motion (NG-IVIM) as well as [18F]-FMISO) PET imaging to select appropriate 30 Gy
candidates to avoid neck dissection, with the goal of further toxicity reduction. The change in intra-
treatment diffusion (D, surrogate of tumor cellularity) and kurtosis (K, surrogate of tissue microstructure) from
baseline DW-MRI will guide which patients de-escalated to 30 Gy can avoid neck dissection. HPV is known to
dysregulate the DNA damage response (DDR) and double-strand break (DSB) repair pathways to facilitate
viral replication. Preclinical work suggests that this dysregulation accounts for the radiosensitivity of HPV+
OPC, although there are conflicting data regarding the precise nature of the responsible defect. For Aim 3,
whole-genome sequencing (WGS) with mutational signature analyses will be used to identify DDR and
DSB repair defects in individual HPV tumors and characterize the clinical influence on radiosensitivity. The
relationship between genomic signatures and non-invasive imaging of tumor hypoxia and tumor cellularity that
portend radiobiological sensitivity also will be explored. The proposal's central hypothesis is that PET/MRI of
HPV+ OPC classification with the underpinnings of a molecular characterization of the cancer biology will
yield a robust decision tool to stratify patients for whom dose de-escalation to 30 Gy will provide a
clinical benefit and significantly reduced toxicity, without compromising treatment outcome.

and has resulted in a pressing need for a workforce with quantitative skills. To meet this need we used our first
NCI R25 funding period to establish the Quantitative Sciences Undergraduate Research Experience (QSURE)
at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK) in Summer 2018. QSURE provides experiential learning
over a 10-week period for up to 10 students in quantitative fields powered by the application of real-world data,
including biostatistics, epidemiology, health outcomes, and computational oncology. In only 5 years, QSURE
has demonstrated substantial demand for quantitative training and expanded the volume of students who
successfully engage in hands-on research in our department by nearly 4-fold. We have achieved the aims of
the first funding period and reported high post-program student and mentor satisfaction as well as improved
student competencies in all years. Most QSURE alumni (71%) have gone on to pursue a PhD or Master’s in a
quantitative field. We will build on these successes and use the next funding period to continue to cultivate a
cadre of responsible, rigorous quantitative scientists through an intensive multidimensional curriculum that
reinforces successful programmatic components, including hands-on research carried out under the guidance
of a faculty mentor, discussion series in the ethical and responsible conduct of research, educational seminars
illustrating wide applications of data, training workshops in quantitative methodology, training and opportunities
for written/oral scientific communication, and career and professional development. We will integrate new
components that address contemporary viewpoints in cancer research and prompt students to consider equity,
diversity, and inclusion in their own research. These will include patient led “fireside chats” that highlight the
role of research in the patient experience, panel discussions that provide global health perspectives through
exchanges with an NCI-funded program for Nigerian trainees, and student-led discussions of works that
reinforce themes in equity, diversity, and inclusion. We will recruit diverse cohorts of motivated undergraduate
interns with a passion for applying quantitative science to reduce cancer morbidity and mortality and evaluate
short- and long-term program success and use these outcomes to inform and disseminate best practices.
Since initial funding QSURE has demonstrated success and resilience in preparing and facilitating the next
generation of research scientists for graduate studies and careers in quantitative fields. During the next funding
period, we will reinforce the successes of our first funding period by designing an enhanced curriculum to help
students contextualize and broaden their understanding of the potential of quantitative science to advance and
support the health of all communities. QSURE will continue to prepare and facilitate interns for graduate
studies and careers in quantitative fields. This is vital to fulfilling our long-term vision of training strong
quantitative scientists dedicated to advancing cancer research.

The Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK) Summer Research Fellowship Program is a cancer
education program that enables 30 first- and second-year U.S. medical students to participate in laboratory and
clinical research under the mentorship of MSK’s clinical faculty. Launched in 1977, this program has enabled
approximately 1,610 medical students to contribute to the research enterprise of a premier academic medical
center. Program participants can work with mentors and in labs centrally involved in both basic and clinical
research; attend MSK’s abundant didactic opportunities; learn how to blend lessons from science and clinical
practice; and present their work to a range of audiences.
The MSK Summer Research Fellowship Program helps address two significant challenges in the field of
oncology.
• The need for more oncologists, especially physician-scientists: In a 2014 report, the American
 Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) projected a shortage of oncologists over the next decade due to
 several factors, including the aging population and an aging oncology workforce. Also, in 2014, the NIH
 issued a report that anticipates that the rising generation of physician-scientists will be insufficient to
 replace those nearing retirement age. The rapidly advancing field of cancer care requires an oncology
 workforce of appropriately trained and engaged physician-scientists that can maintain the pace of
 translation research developments. This program aims to ameliorate this shortage by engaging students’
 interest in oncology research careers.
• The need for more physicians from underrepresented minority populations: The report from ASCO
 described a need for greater racial and ethnic diversity in the physician workforce. This program has
 been able to grow in both size and diversity through the support of MSK’s Office of Diversity Programs.
 In the most recent grant cycle, approximately half of our participants were from underrepresented minority
groups.

Our understanding of DNA replication and its relationship with chromatin structure, nuclear organization
and gene transcription has advanced significantly through the development of genome-wide assays. Most
genome-wide tools to study DNA replication utilize large populations of cells and report on the average
behavior of the population; as such, many infrequent or stochastic events that occur as the replication fork
progresses through chromatin are missed. Recently, we have developed novel methods to map DNA
replication with single-molecule and single-nucleotide precision. In this proposal we will apply this new
technology to understand how DNA synthesis can be completed when the replication machinery
encounters obstacles. We will specifically test how RNA/DNA hybrids and G-quadruplex DNA influence
the progression of DNA replication and whether DNA synthesis can be efficiently restarted downstream of
an impediment. In addition to understanding the progression of replication through chromatin, we will also
investigate how replication is competed during the process of termination. Using high-resolution assays,
we have uncovered a critical role for the DNA helicase Rrm3 in replication termination. We will further
define the role played by Rrm3 and test a novel hypothesis that Rrm3 may prevent catastrophic re-
replication of the genome.

Reproducible assembly of protein molecules from free amino acids requires external information stored
in DNA/RNA (genome). In contrast, assembly of higher-order structures from individual protein molecules
is thought to occur de novo, relying on information intrinsic to each protein component. How higher-order
complexity emerges efficiently without error using only the scattered information in each building block
remains a question hindering core understandings of life. Here we address this question using the
biogenesis of the centriole organelle as the example. We found that a proteinaceous structure called the
cartwheel is grown inside existing centrioles, which is then split, shed and used as structural templates
(or guidance) for reproducing a copy of the centriole with the same size/shape. Uncontrolled cartwheel
shedding was further found to underly a human disease called Alström syndrome. By erasing the old
guidance, we showed that new/naive centrioles varying widely in size and shape arise, which can
propagate reproducibly thereafter in cells otherwise genetically identical. The simplest model explaining
our results is that one or more steps of centriole biogenesis are template-based, instructed by information
stored and transmitted outside of the genome. This model on which the current proposal is based on will
shed light on how cellular complexity emerges reproducibly from components randomly distributed in the
cell, redefining the scope of biological information as we currently understood.

The success of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy in solid tumors requires antigen targets with no
on-target, off-tumor toxicity, effective tumor infiltration, cytotoxicity and proliferation in an immunosuppressive
environment, and revival of antigen stress-induced exhausted CAR T cells. We translated CD28-costimulated
CARs (M28z) that target mesothelin (MSLN), a cancer-associated antigen that we have documented
expression in majority of solid tumors; 64 patients have been treated to date, with no on-target, off-tumor
toxicity. Having demonstrated that regionally administered CAR T cells avoid pulmonary sequestration and
benefit from early antigen-activated CD4 helper CAR T-cell function, we delivered CAR T cells intrapleurally in
patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM), promoting tumor infiltration. To address T-cell
exhaustion, we either treated patients with anti-PD1 agent after CAR T cells or employed tumor-specific
checkpoint blockade by CAR T-cell intrinsic PD1 dominant negative receptor (PD1DNR); 34 patients have
been treated to date, with no CAR- or PD1DNR-related toxicities and with responses by imaging, and
increased survival. To promote IFNγ-mediated cytotoxicity shown to be essential for solid tumor killing, we
exploited a c-KIT mutation, D816V (KITv), as a costimulatory domain. KITv CAR T cells show antigen-
activation induced IFNγ signaling, enhanced cytotoxicity, and when added as signal 3 to CD28 (signal 2),
provide a synergistic function, resist TGFβ-mediated suppression, and prolong functional persistence.
Clinically available kinase inhibitors provide an on/off, tunable safety switch for KITv CAR T cells. To effectively
deliver these next-generation CAR T cells to solid tumors, we developed a translational strategy of non-
ablative, tumor-targeted radiation therapy (RT) to generate a chemokine gradient that facilitates systemically
administered CAR T-cell chemotaxis, tumor infiltration, proliferation, and persistence. Herein, we seek to
translate the M28zKITv-PD1DNR CAR T cells to address key limitations in solid tumor cell therapy. In UG3
phase, we will explore the hypothesis that PD1DNR checkpoint blockade extends beyond tumor cells and
counteracts PDL1-expressing M2 macrophages with immune suppressor function (Aim 1). We will define
optimal regimen of non-ablative, tumor-targeted RT to promote tumor infiltration of systemically administered
CAR T cells, achieving efficacy similar to that with regional delivery. In Aim 3, we will submit an IND
application, a process with which we are familiar and have track record of success. In UH3 phase, we will
conduct a phase I study to investigate the safety, functional activity and efficacy, and markers of response in
patients with MPM. The significance of our approach lies in its effective combination of solid tumor-specific–
scFv that is on-target and safe (MSLN), costimulatory domains (CD28, KITv), checkpoint blockade (PD1DNR),
and a strategy of promoting solid tumor-infiltration (RT) of CAR T cells. The impact of our proposal extends
beyond MPM (>150,000/year pleural cancers in the U.S.); majority of aggressive solid tumors express MSLN.

Current approaches to small molecule drug discovery are slow, expensive, and prone to failure. The abundance
of data for structural biology has led to the emergence of a variety of computer-aided drug discovery
methodologies aiming to leverage this structural data to predict compound affinities to prioritize compounds
for synthesis in the pursuit of potency. Alchemical free energy methods, which use rigorous statistical
mechanics to predict the free energy of binding, have led the way in providing useful predictions for improving
or maintaining potency in hit-to-lead and lead optimization phases of structure-enabled programs. Numerous
offerings---such as Schrödinger FEP+, Orion NES, CCG AMBER-TI, and the Open Force Field Consortium have
emerged that provide engineered solutions with widespread industry adoption for structure-enabled discovery,
integrating advances from academia that my lab has been fortunate to contribute to over the last 15 years.
In contrast to physical methods such as alchemical free energy calculations, the emergence of machine learning
models based on deep learning architectures has provided a complementary tool for computer-aided drug
discovery. While physical models can generalize broadly across properties of interest for many target proteins,
they lack the ability to easily learn from data generated for a discovery program. Machine learning methods, on
the other hand, can readily learn from data, but often lack the ability to predict target-specific properties due to
their need for large training sets, generally limiting their utility to properties of relevance to drug discovery that
do not depend on the target, like ADMET properties.
This proposal builds on our highly successful work in alchemical free energy calculations by proposing a new
generation of hybrid physical / machine learning models that overcome the limitations of each method on its
own: By endowing alchemical free energy calculations with the ability to learn at multiple scales, we aim to
bring these tools into the next decade. Building on our extensive history of innovation in alchemical free energy
calculations for drug discovery, we will (1) significantly increase their accuracy via the integration of ML
potentials; (2) expand their domain of applicability beyond affinity to encompass conformational and target
selectivity, resistance, interactions with structurally-enabled toxicity targets, and physical properties like
membrane permeability, lipophilicity, and solubility; (3) eliminate accuracy-limiting challenges associated with
current calculations such as sampling of protonation and tautomeric states, structured waters, and ions; (4)
introduce learnability into every aspect of alchemical free energy calculations to enable predictions to become
systematically more accurate as project data is collected and greatly reduce the cost of evaluating very large
virtual synthetic spaces with alchemical-like accuracy; and (5) cast alchemical predictions in a Bayesian
framework to enable the propagation of uncertainties in the underlying models into predicted affinities,
selectivities, and other properties.

Single cell sequencing technologies have rapidly advanced over the past five years and have become
essential tools in a broad array of fields, ranging from developmental biology to human genetics. One major
advance was the development of high-throughput barcoding of RNA or DNA within droplets, which allowed for
preparation of sequencing libraries as a pool rather than in a laborious 96 well plate format. This advance
enabled sequencing analysis of thousands of cells in one batch. However, there has not been the same
breakthrough in scale when sequencing both DNA and RNA from the same cell as established techniques
involve sorting cells into plates or wells and ultimately separating DNA and RNA before library preparation. The
separation of RNA from DNA is necessary because conventional PCR amplification requires a 95oC melting
step, which degrades RNA. In this proposal, we will seek to optimize DNA amplification through recombination
polymerase amplification (RPA), an isothermal form of PCR which can be performed simultaneously with
reverse transcription of mRNA into cDNA. In this way, both RNA and DNA can be captured into barcoded,
sequencing libraries within the same droplet. The technology could have impact in many different fields in
which genotype-phenotype correlation is needed, such as characterizing genetic polymorphisms or genetic
variants in cancer. In SA1, we will demonstrate proof-of-principle of same cell DNA amplicon and RNA
transcriptome technology via isothermal RPA and reverse transcription. In SA2, we will determine the
quantitative performance of the methodology in two use applications and test capability to genotype
heterozygous alleles. If successful, this methodology could be widely adopted by laboratories in diverse fields
to answer questions related to genotype-phenotype correlations.

Sepsis is a life-threatening medical condition characterized by high levels of inflammatory markers
and multi-organ damage. Despite standard treatment, sepsis remains a leading cause of morbidity
and mortality in critically ill patients, especially cancer patients. Recently, it has been shown that
acupuncture can induce dopamine production, suppress inflammation, and reduce sepsis in animal
studies. Several randomized controlled clinical trials have shown that acupuncture may reduce
mortality in sepsis patients. However the trials were unblinded and at risk for bias. Here we propose
to fill the knowledge gap by conducting a randomized controlled, patient and evaluator blinded, phase
2 trial of acupuncture (the ACTIONS trial), using sham acupuncture as control, in patients at risk for
sepsis. The specific Aims are: 1) to generate preliminary data for the estimated effect size of
acupuncture in reducing mortality and ICU (Intensive Care Unit) admission of sepsis patients and to
determine the feasibility of conducting a randomized controlled trial of acupuncture in hospitalized
patients who are at risk for sepsis; and 2) to explore whether acupuncture increases catecholamines
and reduces inflammatory cytokines more than sham acupuncture. Seventy-eight patients at risk for
sepsis, will be randomized to true or sham acupuncture daily for 10 days or until transfer to ICU,
death, or discharge. Feasibility endpoints include as accrual rate, intervention delivery rate, attrition
rate, and data completion rate. Efficacy endpoints include mortality and rate of ICU admission.
Biomarker endpoints are plasma levels of catecholamines and pro-inflammatory cytokines, measured
before and after the first acupuncture treatment. If this study shows that acupuncture is deemed
feasible and the estimated effect size warrant a larger study, we plan to conduct a randomized
controlled phase 3 study evaluate the definitive efficacy of acupuncture in improving outcomes of
sepsis patients. The proposed study would be the first one acupuncture study on sepsis using sham
acupuncture as control. The data will also shed light on the mechanism of action of acupuncture. This
project has the potential of developing acupuncture as an innovative clinical approach in the
management of sepsis. It challenges the current clinical practice paradigm and can lead to reduction
of deaths due to sepsis.

Three-dimensional (3D) brain organoids from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) provide a tremendous
opportunity to model brain development and disease. Over the last few years, we have developed many hPSC-based
protocols that now enable researchers to routinely generate > 50 distinct human cell types for modeling both Central
Nervous System and Peripheral Nervous System disorders in a dish. More recently, our lab and others have
translated those 2D approaches into 3D “guided” neural organoid protocols to generate specific regions of the
human brain. Further complexity can be achieved by combining individual organoids into multi-region assembloids,
or by spatially restricted patterning to induce distinct human brain regions within a single organoid. However,
currently available organoid and assembloid models have major limitations, including a poor representation of
several progenitor and neuronal cell populations such as outer radial glia (oRG) and several cortical interneuron
lineages. We posit that the missing or underrepresented cell types may depend on signals provided by non-neural
lineages (vascular and immune cells). In our preliminary work, we have developed an improved hPSC-based
cortical organoid model which dramatically enhances the generation of oRG, cortical-derived interneurons, and
cortical excitatory neurons with increased levels of maturity. This was achieved by treatment with leukemia inhibitor
factor (LIF) resulting in the activation of STAT3 and mTOR signaling pathways. Data from human fetal cortex
development identifies vascular pericytes are a major source of LIF. Remarkably, we demonstrate that integrating
hPSC-derived brain pericytes can substitute for LIF treatment in cortical organoids.
Here, in Aim 1 we will optimize and assess robustness of the LIF organoid protocol and the generation of oRG
across multiple human PSC lines. We will further assess whether oRG give rise to intermediate progenitors, cortical
interneurons and cortical excitatory neurons using a unique oRG-specific double reporter hPSC line and genetic
fate mapping tools. Finally, we will determine how changes in mTOR signaling impact oRG behavior and whether
phenotypes observed in models of Tuberous Sclerosis (TSC) are linked to aberrant oRG function. In Aim 2, we will
build an organoid system that integrates key non-neural cell types. We will establish a modular platform that
combines cortical organoids with 3D spheroids (“microtissues”) comprised of vascular brain pericytes and/or
microglia. These novel microphysiological platform will be utilized to determine both LIF-dependent and LIF
independent effects on cortical development. Finally, we will assess whether such a more complex
microphysiological platform will enable improved modeling of the developmental defects related to mTOR signaling
and TSC.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Imaging plays an increasingly important role in studying development and complex tissue formation across
molecular, cellular and tissue levels. Fluorescence 3D time-lapse imaging allows every cell in a tissue or entire
organism to be imaged, tracked and measured over hours and days to analyze lineage differentiation and
dynamic cell behaviors. Other modalities, e.g., electron and expansion microscopy reveal fine structural
phenomena, while emerging genomics technologies, e.g., spatial transcriptomics, seek to merge with
microscopy to further provide systematic molecular information. Effective tools of image analysis are crucial to
extract, integrate and interpret the information. We propose to leverage the power of deep learning to develop
image analysis tools for systematic in vivo single-cell analysis, and to leverage such analysis to study collective
cell behaviors in tissue morphogenesis, with three Aims. First, we will develop deep learning methods for
accurate cell tracking, which is the essential first step to trace cell lineages and measure dynamic cell
behaviors. We aim to produce a tool that can deliver substantial cell lineages with hundreds to thousands of
cells imaged over hours to days in a wide range of model organisms and organoid cultures. Second, we will
automate landmark-based image registration, which is crucial for cross-modality data integration. We propose
a generalizable approach that uses statistical templates and Neural Networks to address the unique challenge
in developmental images, namely heterochrony of developmental processes that creates combinatorial
configurations of landmarks and complex systematic co-variance. Third, we study a novel Planar Cell Polarity
(PCP) scheme in C. elegans, which we discovered through cell tracking and deep learning of cell movement
patterns. By dissecting the compound polarity scheme and context specific regulators, we aim to understand
how the conserved core PCP pathway can coordinate with different polarity pathways in order to orchestrate
diverse motile behaviors in diverse developmental processes. By integrating technology development and
hypothesis driven research, our proposal will further our understanding of embryogenesis and complex tissue
formation.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
 The maintenance of genome stability across generations is critical for human health and relies on the
efficient repair of spontaneous DNA lesions and the faithful duplication of all chromosomal DNA prior to cell
division. The highly conserved DNA sliding clamps PCNA and 9-1-1 are critical for these genome maintenance
mechanisms in eukaryotic cells by acting as mobile hubs for the assembly of the protein complexes mediating
the signaling and repair of DNA damage and conducting the faithful replication of the nuclear chromosomes.
The dynamic association of PCNA and 9-1-1 with chromosomal DNA is controlled by a set of four conserved
and related ATP-dependent clamp loader complexes that each perform non-redundant genome maintenance
functions in the cell. How eukaryotic clamp loaders target their client clamps to sites of DNA replication and
repair and load the clamps around DNA has been the subject of intense investigation for several decades.
Using advanced biochemical reconstitution approaches and cryogenic electron-microscopy (cryo-EM), we
have recently determined the first structures of active eukaryotic clamp loader:clamp:DNA complexes, which
revealed the molecular basis for the substrate specificities of the yeast RFC and Rad24-RFC complexes and
resulted in a significant revision of current clamp loading models. Building on this work, here we propose to
extend and advance the approaches established by us for the yeast RFC:PCNA and Rad24-RFC:9-1-1 clamp
loader systems to characterize the molecular mechanisms of the yeast and human orthologues of Ctf18-
RFC:PCNA, Elg1ATAD5-RFC:PCNA, and RAD17-RFC:9-1-1. The innovative approach leverages the expertise
of Dr. Remus’ laboratory in the biochemical reconstitution of eukaryotic DNA replication and the expertise of
Dr. Hite’s laboratory in the characterization of the conformational landscapes of protein complexes by cryo-EM.
The proposed studies will determine the mechanistic basis for the functional specialization of CTF18-RFC
(Aim 1), uncover the currently unknown mechanism of PCNA unloading by Elg1ATAD5-RFC:PCNA (Aim 2) and
visualize the spectrum of conformational states of the human RAD17-RFC:9-1-1 complex to reveal the
evolutionary conservation or divergence of the 9-1-1 checkpoint clamp loading mechanism (Aim 3).
Collectively, this work will provide novel mechanistic insight into fundamental genome maintenance pathways.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) enzymes are hallmarks of a variety of deadly cancers, including
acute myeloid leukemia (AML), glioma, cholangiocarcinoma, chondrosarcoma, and T cell lymphoma. Mutant
IDH enzymes drive cancer through an unusual mechanism – they produce a metabolite called 2-
hydroxyglutarate (2HG) that poisons gene expression machinery and locks malignant cells in a stem cell-like
state. Drugs that inhibit mutant IDH enzymes induce durable clinical responses in some patients with IDH-
mutant cancers, leading to FDA approvals for AML and cholangiocarcinoma. However, despite near universal
inhibition of 2HG production, over half of patients do not respond to IDH inhibitors. Even for patients who
initially respond to IDH inhibitors, most eventually acquire resistance to the drugs. While the mechanisms of
resistance to IDH inhibitors remain incompletely understood, emerging evidence suggests that acquisition of
specific co-occurring mutations during tumor evolution results in a loss of dependence on 2HG. Therefore, we
need new treatment approaches that target IDH mutations in different ways beyond simple inhibition of
the enzyme. We previously identified an unusual pattern of resistance mutations in the dimer interface of
mitochondrial IDH2 wherein they occur in trans (on the other allele) relative to the 2HG-producing active-site
mutation. Here, we show that in contrast to the in trans mutations that drive drug resistance, forced expression
of a dimer-interface mutation in cis with the active-site mutation resulted in mitochondrial dysfunction and
impaired growth of leukemia cells. Biochemical and structural studies demonstrated that the in cis dimer-
interface mutation enabled IDH2 to aberrantly use NADH as an additional cofactor and dramatically enhanced
production of 2HG. Seeking to exploit the toxicity exerted by the in cis dimer-interface mutation, we performed
a chemical screen and identified small molecules capable of mimicking this aberrant enzymatic activity with
selective toxicity towards IDH2-mutant leukemia cells. Thus, we hypothesize that hyperactivation (rather
than inhibition) of mutant IDH offers an unexpected and effective new strategy to target IDH-mutant
cancers. This hypothesis will be rigorously tested in three Specific Aims. Aim 1 will use enzyme assays and
structural approaches to elucidate the biochemical basis for mutant IDH2 hyperactivation. Aim 2 will employ in
vitro and in vivo cancer models to define the mechanisms of toxicity arising from hyperactivation of mutant
IDH2. Aim 3 will utilize biochemical and functional approaches to determine if the approach of hyperactivation
can applied to cytosolic IDH1 mutations. The proposed studies will reshape our understanding of the
oncogenic properties of 2HG and the biochemistry of neomorphic IDH activation. More fundamentally, this
work will demonstrate the feasibility of an entirely novel hyperactivation approach as a strategy to harness
oncogene-mediated toxicity that could be applied to a wide range of oncogenes and cancer contexts.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Current standard tri-modality therapy (chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery) for locally advanced rectal cancer
is associated with high morbidity and only cures disease in about 75% of patients. We hypothesize that a
biomarker-driven approach that gives matched targeted therapy to patients early in the treatment of locally
advanced rectal cancers will lead to high anti-tumor activity and provide the chance to avoid radiation and/or
surgery and its associated morbidities. We have already pioneered such an approach for mismatch repair
deficient locally advanced rectal cancer, where clinical complete response was seen in all patients who
completed 6 months of upfront treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors (23/23, 100% complete clinical
response), allowing for the omission of radiation and/or surgery. In this proposal, we focus on patients with
HER2-amplified rectal cancer and hypothesize that induction therapy with HER2-targeted treatment will lead to
tumor regression and modify the need for tri-modality therapy. We propose an investigator-initiated phase II
study (NCT05672524; MSK IRB# 22-185) that recently opened to enrollment; all patients will receive tucatinib
plus trastuzumab induction HER2-targeted therapy for 6 weeks and continue tucatinib plus trastuzumab with
addition of standard-of-care chemotherapy for 4 months, followed by disease reassessment before standard
chemoradiation and before surgery. Patients with clinical complete response to induction HER2 therapy alone
or combined with chemotherapy, or to the combination followed by chemoradiation, will undergo observation
with a chance for an organ-sparing management approach. Our central hypothesis is that the primary tumor will
be highly sensitive to HER2-targeted therapy alone or in combination with standard chemotherapy, leading to a
higher frequency of clinical complete response than with standard total neoadjuvant therapy. Treatment of rectal
cancer in patients provides the unique opportunity to obtain on-treatment longitudinal tumor and blood samples
to evaluate mechanisms of response and resistance. We hypothesize that levels of HER2 expression and
consequent dependence on HER2 homodimers underlie drug response and will determine HER2 expression in
biopsy samples and with 89Zr-trastuzumab PET/MRI and correlate with response rate and progression-free
survival. Circulating tumor DNA will be tested as a biomarker for response. Established and newly generated
patient-derived HER2-amplified colorectal cancer organoids will be used to model and study acquired resistance,
taking advantage of our team's expertise in generating these three-dimensional, multi-cellular structures, which
both recapitulate the biology of rectal cancer and provide a needed resource that expands the limited HER2-
amplified rectal cancer models currently available. We hypothesize that key resistance mechanisms will consist
of decreased HER2 expression, secondary alterations that activate ERK, and shifts in tumor transcriptional
programs. Together, we will define the efficacy and biological effects of biomarker-directed therapy and aim to
transform treatment for patients with HER2-amplified locally advanced rectal cancer.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
In 2020, 53 million people in the U.S. served as family caregivers, the partners, relatives, and friends who
provide assistance (i.e., physical, emotional) to patients with often life-threatening, incurable illnesses.
Caregivers are increasingly tasked with responsibilities once performed by medical professionals, and the
availability and health of supportive caregivers is more critical than ever. A growing number of caregivers
provide care to patients with advanced, life-limiting cancers, and are tasked with critical patient care
responsibilities, and play a significant role in healthcare communication and advanced care planning as
healthcare proxies. The burden of these responsibilities is great and is driven largely by existential distress,
which contributes to anxiety, depression, poor quality of life, and mental health challenges in bereavement.
Concurrently, caregiving is an opportunity to experience a profound sense of meaning and purpose; caregiving
allows for the realization of new strengths and capacities, healing of relationships, and refinement of life goals.
When existential distress is addressed, caregivers can experience an enhanced sense of well-being despite
their challenges. While many interventions have been developed to support cancer caregivers, none directly
target existential distress. Our group adapted Meaning-Centered Psychotherapy (MCP), a highly effective
intervention in decreasing existential distress and enhancing well-being among patients with advanced cancer,
for cancer caregivers. Meaning-Centered Psychotherapy for Cancer Caregivers (MCP-C) is a stakeholder-
informed, innovative, manualized intervention designed to assist caregivers to connect to meaning and
purpose in life, despite the challenges of caregiving. Results of our pilot randomized controlled demonstrated
MCP-C’s feasibility, acceptability, and superiority in improving meaning, benefit-finding, depression, and
spiritual wellbeing. In the proposed trial, we will more rigorously evaluate the efficacy of MCP-C through a
randomized controlled trial of 200 caregivers of patients with advanced (Stage III/IV solid tumor) cancer who
will receive 7 sessions of MCP-C or Supportive Psychotherapy for Caregivers (SP-C), the standard of
community-based caregiver care. Participants will undergo assessments of meaning and spiritual wellbeing
(primary outcomes), and anxiety, depression, benefit finding, caregiver burden, and social support (secondary
outcomes) at baseline, post-treatment, and at 6- and 12-months follow-up. Bereavement outcomes including
pre- and post-loss grief, preparedness for loss, and regret will also be evaluated at each time point. We predict
MCP-C will result in greater improvements in primary and secondary outcomes, and that sense of meaning in
life will mediate treatment effects. We also predict that MCP-C will result in better preparedness for loss and
improved pre- and post-loss grief and regret. Our results will enhance our capacity to powerfully target
existential distress in caregivers of patients with advance cancer and by extension, improve their capacity to
provide critical care to patients at end-of-life.

Small-Molecule Penetration and Efflux in Gram-Negative Bacteria
Gram-negative bacterial infections are increasing in incidence and novel antibiotics are urgently needed to
combat this growing threat to public health. These pathogens have high intrinsic resistance to antibiotics due
to their combination of a two-membrane cell envelope, which presents a permeability barrier to small
molecules, and prevalent efflux pumps, which eject molecules that have successfully penetrated the barrier. A
major obstacle to the development of novel antibiotics is our poor understanding of the structural features of
small molecules that correlate with penetration and efflux across this barrier. As a result, large screening
campaigns of existing discovery libraries have mostly failed to provide new antibacterials. Similarly, while
potent biochemical inhibitors can often be identified for new targets, converting them into compounds with
whole-cell antibacterial activity has proven challenging.
To address this critical problem, we have developed a comprehensive experimental and computational
platform to evaluate and model Small-molecule Penetration and Efflux in Antibiotic-Resistant Gram-Negative
bacteria (SPEAR-GN, “speargun”). We have established all of the key enabling technologies required and
strong proof of concept for the effectiveness of this platform. We will now use our platform to assemble the
larger datasets required to train robust machine learning models of penetration and efflux that will be of broad
utility in antibacterial drug discovery. Herein, we will design and synthesize chemical libraries to map bacterial
penetration and efflux space, analyze compound accumulation in Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa,
and Acinetobacter baumannii using isogenic strain sets that decouple outer-membrane penetration from efflux,
evaluate the role of the BamA outer membrane protein in facilitated permeation of antibiotics, develop machine
learning models based on the assay data to predict compound accumulation, and use the models to design
and synthesize new molecules with improved accumulation in Gram-negative bacteria. Success in this project
will provide a major advance in the field of antibacterial drug discovery to address this major public health
threat.
This project will be carried out by an established multidisciplinary team with a proven track record in this field
and extensive combined expertise in library synthesis and medicinal chemistry, biochemistry and microbiology,
high-throughput assays and mass spectrometry, cheminformatics and machine learning, and antibacterial drug
discovery.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has led to significant advances in the study of brain structure and
function. In studies of auditory perception and speech-related functions, the earphones used to deliver
stimuli in an MR scanner must not contain ferrous or magnetic metals due to the scanner's immense
magnetic field strength. In addition, the strong magnetic gradients and radio frequency energy used during a
scan can induce electric currents even in non-ferrous metal components, which must be carefully designed
to prevent excessive heating. Finally, any metallic structures can interfere with the imaging process, leading
to artifacts in the image. New imaging protocols to improve spatial resolution and temporal sensitivity can
increase energy deposition and heating in materials with magnetic susceptibility that were unaffected under
older imaging protocols. While most of the world's MR scanners use magnetic field strengths of 3 Tesla (T)
or less, the demand for higher imaging resolution drives demand for scanners with greater field strength,
making them a fast-growing sector of the scanner market. Increasingly, research centers are installing
human MR systems capable of static field strengths of 7T or higher, with about 100 such scanners installed
worldwide; a handful of 9T scanners are already in operation, and a massive 11.7T human system is online
at the Neurospin facility in France. For animal research, small-bore scanners with ultra-high fields are in
use. The growing presence of ultra-high field systems will require earphones that can provide research-
grade auditory stimuli without compromising safety or introducing image distortions. There is no
commercially available audio driver that is free of metallic components. Even our company's current
earbuds—mostly used in 1.5T and 3T scanners—include some (non-ferrous) metallic components as
mechanical sound amplifiers and electrical conductors. Successive generations of earbud models have
progressively reduced metallic components to minimize imaging artifacts and heating, but this iterative
material reduction is no longer sufficient. Instead, a fundamentally new approach is required—we propose
to build earbuds entirely free of metallic components. For this, we will develop a novel audio driver that
does not require metal parts to deliver research-quality audio stimuli. The design will then be tested in 7T
and 11.7T scanners.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) is an epidemic. An estimated 34 million people in the US have T2DM and 84 million
have pre-diabetes - nearly half of whom are adults 65+ yo, putting many older adults at higher risk of unhealthy
aging and cognitive decline. A healthy lifestyle can treat and even reverse T2DM. But making lifestyle changes
is hard and many people fail, contributing to $327B in US healthcare costs. Diabetes group visits (DGV) and
diabetes self- management education and support (DSME/S) help people with T2DM to learn and sustain
complex disease management skills. Yet, access to DSME/S is limited such participation in DSME/S programs
is reportedly as low as 7% among adults with T2DM. New technologies supporting DSME/S programs are
emerging, but most fail to meet the unique needs of older adults with limited technology fluency, creating a new
digital divide. See Yourself Health (SYH) aims to bridge this digital health gap for older adults with a newly
designed immersive learning and telehealth application – the HOPE App – designed to deliver high-impact, high
engagement diabetes care and DSME/S tailored for older adults with diabetes.
Advancements in virtual reality software, new cloud gaming technology and user interface design have enabled
our team to envision a new telehealth and immersive learning environment to support chronic disease self-
management needs of older adults with diabetes. We use virtual reality, telecommunication technology and
social gaming strategies to offer real-time peer support, care coaching, and 28 modules of live-action experiential
learning programs to help participants master complex diabetes self-management skills. In our Phase I SBIR
project, we reached the following milestones: prototyped the HOPE App platform with cloud access and new
navigation and communication features; completed usability testing (SUS = 71) with 20 target users and
feasibility testing (100% participation) of the HOPE App platform; developed new DSME content for older adults.
In Phase II, we will further develop the HOPE App patient engagement and population health management
features and capabilities and then assess its efficacy in a fully powered clinical trial. Specific Aim 1: Develop the
HOPE App’s state-of-the-art immersive patient engagement experience with automated onboarding, social
networking and gamified DSME/S features to support long-term patient retention. Specific Aim 2: Develop the
HOPE App’s predictive analytic capabilities for population health management. Specific Aim 3: Clinical validation
of the HOPE App intervention on six-month clinical outcomes (A1c), patient reported outcomes (diabetes
distress) and engagement (patient retention, adherence to DSME/S). SYH has assembled an expert business
team to sell the HOPE APP to our target customer, health care payors. The HOPE APP offers a simple, high-
impact, highly engaging, immersive telehealth experience with the potential to become a ubiquitous diabetes
management tool to transform diabetes patients into high performing drivers of their own care.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：The type II transmembrane protein Fas ligand (Fasl) was first identified as a death receptor ligand that induced
Fas+ target cells to undergo apoptosis. As such, its constitutive expression in the eye has historically been linked
to the phenomenon of immune privilege and its ability to kill activated eye-infiltrating Fas+ effector cells, or eye-infiltrating
Fas+ vascular endothelial cells. However, this notion is confounded by the fact that many non-hematopoietic
cell types in the eye, including retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), constitutively express Fas. In fact,
Fasl-mediated destruction of RGCs is a key factor in glaucoma pathogenesis, either by direct killing of RGCs
and/or by inducing the production of proinflammatory chemokines by Fas+ glial cells (eg. astrocytes), that recruit
proinflammatory cells to the retina and thereby causing neurotoxic inflammation. This apparent conundrum can
be explained if one accepts our hypothesis that constitutive metalloproteinase-mediated cleavage of
membraned-bound Fasl (mFasL), releases a soluble fragment (sFasL) that opposes the neurotoxic activity of
mFasL. This premise is supported by preliminary data showing: (a) mice with a gene-targeted mutation of Fasl
that eliminates this Fasl cleavage site (mFaslmice) develop accelerated glaucoma in spontaneous and
inducible glaucoma models; {b} in healthy eyes, retinal Fasl is constitutively cleaved, but in glaucomatous eyes,
retinal Fasl is membrane-bound; and (c) intravitreal injection of an AAV2-sFasL vector prior to disease onset
can prevent the development of glaucoma, while injection of AAV2-sFasL after disease onset can reverse
functional defects. Together, these data point to Fasl as an important therapeutic target for patients with
glaucoma. However, a number of key questions remain unanswered and will be addressed by the proposed 3
specific aims: (Aim 1) When and how is Fasl cleavage suppressed during the development and progression of
glaucoma and how do ADAM10 and TIMP1 in regulate Fasl cleavage ?; (Aim 2) To what extent does the direct
engagement of Fas, expressed by astrocytes and/or RGCs, contribute to the development of glaucoma?; and
(Aim 3) Can sFasL directly engage Fas to elicit a protective gene expression program? Our research strategy
will involve both accepted and novel experimental tools, including (a) sortase-tagged-Fasl mice (provide by Dr.
Ploegh}, that will greatly facilitate our ability to monitor mFasL vs sFasL protein levels in the eye, {b} Fas-flexed
mice crossed to RGC- and astrocyte/muller-specific ere-deleter lines, that will allow us to identify the importance
of these cells in the development of glaucoma; (c) allophenic (tetraparental) chimeric mice made by fusing Fas+
and Fasn•9 embryos, that will allow us to distinguish direct and indirect effects of Fasl engagement in the context
of glaucoma, and {d} AAV2-sFasL vectors that will allow us to determine if sFasL functions independently of

the effective manipulation of Fas/Fasl interactions in patients afflicted with glaucoma and other ocular disorders.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Dry eye disease (DED) is a chronic immune-mediated disorder of the ocular surface, characterized by
disruption of the epithelial barrier and sustained ocular surface inflammation, which in severe cases results
in blindness from corneal ulceration and scarring. DED is arguably the most common ophthalmologic
condition for which patients visit eye care professionals, with more than 16 million US adults estimated to
have been diagnosed with DED (several folds higher than age-related macular degeneration). Notably, the
prevalence of DED increases with age. The financial burden of DED to the US healthcare system is vast,
with direct costs and expenses from productivity losses estimated to exceed $3.5 billion annually.
 The work of several laboratories, including the Principal Investigator's, has revealed key insights
concerning the immunopathogenesis of DED. There is now strong evidence that T helper-17 (Th17) cells
are critical promoters of immune-mediated damage to the ocular surface. The PI's laboratory has shown
that memory Th17 (mTh17) cells maintain disease chronicity, resulting in ocular surface epitheliopathy that
persists for many months after exposure to desiccating stress. Moreover, data from the PI's lab show that
regulatory T cells (Tregs) are defective in suppressing the Th17 response in DED. In addition, the PI's lab
has identified critical mechanisms controlling antigen-presenting cell (APC) activation and trafficking in
DED, as well as effector Th17 priming, expansion and homing. Despite substantial progress in unraveling
underlying immunopathogenic mechanisms, important questions remain unanswered.
 We hypothesize that (1) chronic DED is characterized by long-term impairment in the function of
regulatory T cells (Tregs) that normally maintain immune quiescence, and that (2) the aged are more
susceptible to DED due to a larger pool of memory Th17, whose function is inadequately regulated by aged
Tregs. The principal objectives of this project are to (i) precisely define the phenotypic changes that
characterize, and the mechanisms that promote long-term Treg dysfunction in DED; (ii) determine the
cellular precursors of mTh17 cells, as well as the cytokine mechanisms that influence the generation of
immunologic memory; and (iii) define the factors that amplify mTh17 immunity in aging. To achieve these
objectives, three specific aims have been defined to answer the following questions: Aim 1: What are the
causative mechanisms of enduring Treg dysfunction in DED? Aim 2: Which effector Th17 subsets are
predisposed to enter the memory pool (thus permitting DED chronicity), and what factors regulate this
process? And finally Aim 3: What are the cellular and molecular mechanisms that augment Th17-mediated
DED in aging? It is anticipated that this research will have significant translational impact given the high
prevalence of DED, the still limited knowledge we have regarding its immunopathogenesis, and the relative
scarcity of effective treatments.

the St. Regis Mohawk Tribe (SRMT) of Akwesasne, NY in partnership with the Roswell Park
Comprehensive Cancer Center (RP) led by the RP Center for Indigenous Cancer Research (RP-
CICR) in Buffalo, NY. Establishing the ARCH will support the development of two research
projects and one student enhancement project, all co-developed and co-led by SRMT and RP.
The proposed Administrative Core will establish key personnel, supplies, and in-person or virtual
meetings to coordinate project timelines, deliverables, evaluation efforts, and community
engagement. The Environmental Health Research Project will engage RP environmental
scientists and state-of-the-art equipment to measure environmental health concerns in
Akwesasne landscapes and their relationships to the human condition. The liver wellness project
titled, LIVE (Live, Indigenous, Virtual, Enhancement), includes a culturally tailored liver health
promotion program to encourage traditional and healthy life ways through community-based
education and lifestyle modification. To support research interest amongst the younger generation
in Akwesasne, the ARCH proposal includes the St. Regis Mohawk Research Scholars Program.
This program engages high school and college students in a three-prong approach, 1.)
Community Engagement Conferences to create research and science career awareness and
recruit students to participate in afterschool and summer research opportunities; 2.) An After
School Health Science Club to provide students with working knowledge of public health, data
collection methods, statistical analysis approaches, health behavior and epidemiology principles;
and 3.) a Summer Program to provide high school and college students with immersive research
experiences integrated with core research projects of ARCH, and to apply principles and skill sets
to addressing cancer health disparities and environmental health issues specific to the SRMT.
Each project in the ARCH would be directed by the Principal Investigator from the SRMT Health
Division and coordinated by key personnel identified both at SRMT and RP's Center for
Indigenous Cancer Research. This direct partnership with the SRMT Health Division supports
RP's existing Memorandum of Understanding with the Indian Health Service that agrees to
collaborate in the areas of cancer research; research; consultation/technical assistance focused
on cancer prevention; capacity building; and direct services in partnership with American Indian
and Alaska Native communities. The SRMT will activate this MoU to further guide the
development of the ARCH.

An estimated 3 million people are affected by glaucoma in the United States, and increasing life expectancy
exacerbates the disease’s socio-economic impact. Glaucoma and other optic neuropathies lead to permanent
damage of the optic nerve and loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). No therapies are currently available to
mitigate irreversible vision loss. The feasibility of cell replacement therapy was recently demonstrated using
RGCs isolated from a developing retina. Furthermore, we have shown that it is possible to achieve robust and
reproducible transplants with stem cell-derived RGCs. While our donor RGCs survived in host retinas following
transplantation, cell survival does not equate to the restoration of vision, and poor structural and functional
integration remains a significant challenge for successful RGC replacement.
One of the key molecular features limiting donor RGC integration into the existing circuitry is likely to be the
vestigial homophilic molecular cues that guide somatic spacing and dendritic arborization during development.
Down Syndrome Cell Adhesion Molecule (DSCAM) has been identified as a key molecular cue that mediates
neuronal self-avoidance to prevent fasciculation and preserve mosaic spacing in the retina during development.
We hypothesize that these same mechanisms govern the integration of transplanted RGCs and that
homophilic molecular cues, including DSCAM, limit donor RGC migration towards their natural
connecting points within the retina. Therefore, this proposal aims to investigate DSCAM in the context of RGC
transplantation to understand how self-avoidance mechanisms contribute to neural circuit development and
repair.
Using RGC transplantation into the retina as a model system, we will determine if DSCAM-mediated self-
avoidance mechanisms are dose-mediated, rely on transcellular interactions, and function similarly irrespective
of neural migration. To investigate the need for transcellular DSCAM expression for RGC self-avoidance, we will
conduct a series of transplantation experiments using gain- and lose-of-function (GOF and LOF) mice.
Expression of DSCAM by mouse stem cell-derived RGC will be suppressed with siRNA before intravitreal
injections. Similarly, to investigate if DSCAM regulates donor RGC spacing independent of the mode of
migration, we will suppress DSCAM in host and donor RGCs while temporarily destabilizing the donor RGC’s
cytoskeleton to alter their migratory modality between somal translocation and multipolar migration. Live imaging
and quantitative immunohistochemistry will be used to assess donor cell morphology and distribution in the
retina. Anterograde tracing and retinal explants cultured on multielectrode arrays will be used to evaluate
synapse formation with host bipolar cells. Altogether, this mechanistic approach would significantly impact the
development of cell replacement therapy for glaucoma and other neurodegenerative diseases.

Notch 3 mutations are the cause of cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts
and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL), a small vessel disease characterized by stroke and vascular
cognitive impairment. Transgenic mouse studies from our lab and others have shown that Notch 3 sig-
naling is critical for mural cell survival, and blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity, and that Notch 3 knock-
out mice have increased susceptibility to hypoxia-induced stroke. Loss of mural cells (MCs), including
pericytes and vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs), in the small penetrating arteries of the brain is a
hallmark of CADASIL and a major contributor to vascular dysfunction. Importantly, in both humans and
mouse models, loss-of-function (LOF) Notch 3 mutations cause MC death. Currently, there are no tar-
geted therapies available for CADASIL. We have also shown that antibodies can be used to modulate
Notch 3 signaling in mouse models of CADASIL. Specifically, we showed that a mouse monoclonal an-
tibody administered in a CADASIL mouse model can prevent MC loss. Our proposal will optimize a mo-
dality of treatment for CADASIL by humanizing a mouse monoclonal Notch 3 agonist antibody. Our pro-
ject goals are as follows. Aim 1. To generate a panel of agonist Notch3 human monoclonal antibodies
(humAbs). We propose to humanize a mouse monoclonal antibody capable of activating human Notch
3, via grafting of complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) into human framework regions (FRs).
Aim 2. To rank order the candidate antibodies using in vitro assays. We will screen candidate human-
ized antibodies for the preservation of specific Notch 3 antigen recognition using a sensitive in vitro
ELISA test detecting target engagement and activation of human Notch3 receptors via release of the
Notch 3 extracellular domain (N3ECD) biomarker. Aim 3. Prepare cell line for the production of lead
humAb. We will produce at least two humanized A13 (huA13) for preclinical in vivo testing by generat-
ing a cell line using Switchable Membrane Reporter (SwiMR) technology for antibody production. Aim
4. To test the preclinical efficacy of lead Notch 3 humAbs in mouse models of Notch 3 deficiency and
CADASIL. We will screen our humanized antibody candidates for biologic effects including Notch 3 acti-
vation in CNS vessels, crossing the blood-CNS barrier, normalization of N3ECD in blood, a target en-
gagement biomarker linked to Notch3 signaling in vivo, and rescue of mural cell loss. Aim 5. To evalu-
ate toxicity and pharmacokinetics. We will examine toxicity and pharmacokinetics antibody administra-
tion of increasing single-dose in mice.

The goal of the NIMH Repository and Genomics Resource (NRGR) is to further the understanding of the
genetic and environmental etiologies of mental disorders. The NRGR receives raw biosamples, such as blood,
from NIMH-supported research projects. The NRGR processes these samples to DNA, RNA, cDNA, or cell
lines, which can then be used for genomic analyses. The NRGR also receives, curates, and harmonizes
clinical/phenotypic data for each subject. Results of genomic analyses on samples in the NRGR are either
directly deposited in the NRGR or are linked to a deposit in another public repository. After a proprietary
period, the clinical data, genomic data, DNA, RNA, cDNA, and cell lines are made available to all NIMH-
approved researchers through a secure web portal. This sharing of uniformly processed biological samples
and curated clinical and genomic data from many cohorts leverages the NIMH investment in genetic studies. It
provides critical research power by making a very large body of data available for study of the genetic bases
for individual mental disorders. Since October 1998, >250K subject samples have been submitted to NRGR
and >615K DNA and >15K cell lines have been distributed. There have been >1,700 distributions of clinical
and genomic data to >1,000 investigators, resulting in >1,000 publications using NRGR samples and data.
Starting in 2011, the NRGR has provided in-depth characterization services for induced pluripotent stem cells
(iPSC) and their progenitor somatic cells, as well as limited iPSC production. As its guiding aim, the NRGR will
continue to innovate in order to serve the scientific needs of NIMH PIs in a flexible and highly accessible
manner, while respecting subject confidentiality, informed consent issues, and PI prerogatives.

The enjoyment of fat-rich foods has benefitted our species by providing necessary energy, as well as lipid
components that are crucial for growth and development. Thus, it is no surprise that fatty acid detection
components have been recently identified in taste tissue, likely evolved for the necessary intake of energy and
essential fatty acids. The endocannabinoid system (ECS) has recently been implicated in both the detection of
and reward conferred by fatty acids in fatty foods. These detection and reward systems serve to increase intake
of triglyceride-rich foods, which is evolutionarily advantageous. Today, an overabundance of LCFAs, especially
omega 6 and saturated fatty acids, are present in processed foods and snacks (doughnuts, ice cream, etc.),
adding to the growing global obesity phenomenon. In particular, the anabolic ECS that drives consumption by
strengthening fat intake reward is damaging health in the Western food environment. We presently seek to
understand how the endocannabinoid system impacts oral fatty acid detection and the hedonic evaluation of
fatty, palatable foods, as well as how these parameters are altered in obese individuals. These experiments will
allow us to understand how to develop therapeutic targets of the ECS in order to sensitize ‘fat taste’ and reduce
the desire for and consumption of fatty foods in obese individuals.

understanding, prevention and treatment of complex disorders such as cancer, diabetes,
substance abuse, etc., which are significantly on the rise. The promise of data science can be
fully realized only when collected data can be collaboratively shared and analyzed. However, the
widespread increases in healthcare data breaches due to inappropriate access as well as the
increasing number of novel privacy attacks restrict institutions from sharing data. Indeed, in some
cases, the results of the analysis can themselves lead to significant privacy harm. The success
of the data commons depends on ensuring the maximal access to data, subject to all of the patient
privacy requirements including those mandated by legislation, and all of the constraints of the
organization collecting the data itself. While there are existing solutions that can solve parts of the
problem, there are significant challenges in truly incorporating these into comprehensive working
solutions that are usable by the biomedical research community, and new challenges brought on
by modern techniques such as deep learning. The long-term goal of this research is to develop
technologies that can holistically enable data sharing while respecting privacy and security
considerations and to ensure that they are implemented in existing platforms that have
widespread acceptance in the research community. Towards this, the objective of this project is
to develop complementary solutions for risk inference, distributed learning, and access control
that can enable different modalities of data sharing. The problems studied are general in nature
and will evolve depending on research successes and new impediments that arise. The proposed
program of research is significant since lack of access to biomedical data can lead to
fragmentation of care, resulting in higher economic and social costs, and is a significant
impediment to biomedical research. The project will result in open-source, freely available
software tools that will be integrated into widely used data collection, cohort identification, and
distributed analytics platforms. There are several ongoing collaborations that will serve as initial
pilot customers to provide use cases, identify the requirements, evaluate results, and in general
validate the developed solutions.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Traumatic brain injury has many sequelae resulting from the initial injury that exacerbate neural
degeneration and functional deficits, which may emerge over long times following the initial
injury. While many studies have examined secondary neuronal loss in the penumbra of the
injury site that occurs due to the induction of inflammatory cytokines and an altered trophic
environment, the impact of these changes in the injured tissue on afferent axons that project to
the injury site from distal locations has not been investigated. In particular, basal forebrain
cholinergic neurons (BFCN) project throughout the cortex and hippocampus, and these neurons
are critical for numerous cognitive functions. These neurons express all the neurotrophin
receptors, the Trk family (TrkA, TrkB, and TrkC) which promote neuronal survival and axonal
growth, as well as p75NTR, which can promote neuronal death and axon degeneration.
Therefore, the consequence of altered levels of trophic factors in the target regions of these
neurons may critically impact the integrity of their axonal projections and ultimately have
negative consequences for the cognitive functions supported by these neurons. Using the fluid
percussion injury (FPI) model to induce moderate TBI in mice, we will investigate the immediate
and long-term consequences of cortical injury on the afferent basal forebrain neurons. Using
compartment culture strategies, we will investigate mechanisms of axonal signaling that mediate
retrograde degenerative responses. Understanding the full scope of damage that occurs as a
consequence of TBI is critical to developing therapeutic strategies to limit the negative
consequences of the injury.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Overview. Human fMRI and LFP recording studies suggest that the anterior insula encodes the salience of
stimuli and deviations from expectations. However, BOLD signals and LFPs have insufficient resolution to assess
how these codes are distributed across insular cells. Moreover, the origin and functional relevance of insular
codes is unclear. We will address these questions with multi-site single unit and LFP recordings as well as
optogenetic methods in rats. Critically, our pilot data indicates that presentation of salient stimuli elicits identical
LFP responses in rats and humans: bursts of high amplitude beta (13-30 Hz) oscillations.
Significance and approach. Because its volume is reduced in most psychiatric disorders, the insula is a
promising therapeutic target for transcranial or deep brain stimulation. However, progress in this field has been
hindered by a lack of high-resolution data about insula signaling. Thus, this proposal may facilitate the
development of novel therapies. To study the insula in rats, we developed a novel reinforcement learning task
that features a behavioral readout of the rats’ expectations (and their violations). This task will allow us to assess
how anterior insula neurons and their synaptic partners encode multiple variables and probe their role in learning.
Aim #1 Characterize the coding properties of neurons in the anterior insula and its synaptic partners.
We will perform multi-site unit and LFP recordings in the anterior insula and its synaptic partners. This will allow
us to: (1) test whether cells at these various sites encode outcome valence, magnitude, salience, and deviations
from expectations; (2) test whether valenced stimuli elicit bursts of beta oscillations in the anterior insula, as seen
in humans; (3) compare the entrainment of neurons at these various sites by oscillations of different frequencies;
(4) test whether the amplitude of insular beta bursts tracks stimulus salience and deviations from expectations.
Aim #2: Determine which inputs drive coding of different variables in anterior insula neurons. The data
obtained in Aim 1 will suggest which inputs convey information about different variables to insula neurons. Similar
hypotheses will arise regarding the origin and propagation of insular beta bursts. To test these hypotheses, we
will infuse AAVs driving the expression of an inhibitory opsin in projection-defined cell types. Then, we will inhibit
the candidate cell types and assess how these manipulations affect the coding properties of insula neurons as
well as the genesis and propagation of insular beta bursts.
Aim #3 Test whether reducing or enhancing insular beta bursts impairs or facilitates learning. We will
achieve real-time control over insular beta bursts by combining optogenetics with programmable multi-channel
signal processors, giving us unprecedented control over fast neuronal events. We will enhance or dampen
insular beta bursts by delivering low-intensity light stimuli that bias spike times in or out-of-phase with respect to
beta oscillations, without altering firing rates. If insular beta bursts facilitate learning, up- or down-regulating them
should respectively accelerate or slow down learning in the task.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
Even at the earliest cortical stages, visual processing is influenced by internally generated information. Top-
down influence on visual processing is found in very different behavioral contexts. As a result, early visual areas
are increasingly considered as “interfaces” or “blackboards” where bottom-up information is confronted to top-
down representations. Yet, our knowledge on the cellular and network mechanisms by which top-down signals
modulate the integrative properties of visual cortical neurons is still fragmentary. Moreover, the impact on visual
processing and visual perception of the relatively small top-down modulations that were described in early visual
cortices is debated. Finally, we ignore to what extent top-down modulation is flexible and can be adapted to a
novel behavioral goal. Our long-term goal is to better understand the functions and mechanisms of top-down
influences on early visual processing using a recent and tractable model: the modulation by sound of visual
processing in V1. We have recently shown that the representation of the orientation and direction of the visual
stimulus in V1 is improved in the audiovisual context, through a potentiation of the response of neurons with
preferred orientations matching the orientation of the visual cue, and a suppression of the activity of neurons
coding for orthogonal orientations and opposite directions. The overall objective of this application is to establish
the cellular and network mechanisms, functional impact and flexibility of sound modulation on early visual pro-
cessing. Our central hypotheses, based on our preliminary data, is that sound modulation in V1 results from the
activation of local mechanisms controlling the orientation and direction tuning of V1 neurons, that modest im-
provements of the representation of visual stimuli can improve visual perception, and that sound modulation in
V1 is flexible and can be adapted to novel behavioral goals by training. The rationale for the proposed research
is to better understand why, when and how internal representations bias sensory perception. To test our central
hypotheses, we propose the following specific aims: 1) Determine the cellular mechanisms underpinning the
orientation and direction-dependent sound modulation of V1 neurons by performing whole-cell recordings in
awake mice, a technique for which our laboratory has a unique expertise; Using two-photon calcium imaging in
mice performing Go/NoGo behavioral tasks, we will also 2) Determine the impact of sound modulation on the
representation of the visual stimulus in V1 and on visual perception; 3) Demonstrate that sound modulation is
flexible and can be adapted to a novel behavioral task though training. Our approach is innovative because we
will bring to the mouse a topic so far mostly addressed in primates to benefit from functional imaging, genetic
tools and our unique skill at performing whole-cell recordings in awake behaving mice. The proposed research
is significant because it is expected to vertically advance our understanding on how top-down inputs adapt visual
processing to the behavioral goal. Ultimately, such a knowledge will inform the pathophysiology of several de-
velopmental, and degenerative disorders in which top-down control of sensory processing is impaired.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Project Summary
Social isolation is associated with a host of negative outcomes including increased rates of depression and early
mortality. Critically, social isolation can lead to maladaptive choices such as substance use as a coping strategy
for negative affect. Importantly, perceived connection with others can ameliorate adverse consequences of
isolation, potentially mitigating maladaptive coping mechanisms (i.e., substance use). Indeed, close connections
with others satisfy basic needs of belongingness and are associated with enhancing the reward value of social
experiences as reflected in reward-related neural circuits. While evidence in rodents suggests that the potential
for social interaction decreases the likelihood of substance use, there remains a critical gap in treatment
approaches in enabling substance-dependent individuals to form healthy social connections. This is in large part
due to: 1) neurobiological models of substance abuse have yet to widely integrate social context; 2) dynamic
social interactions are difficult to study in laboratory settings; and 3) a current lack of mechanistic understanding
how social rewards facilitate the development of social bonds.
Our proposal aims to delineate the mechanisms underlying the formation of social bonds as a precursor to
understanding how they may help sway maladaptive behaviors. We suggest that a critical aspect to forming a
social connection is developing a shared interpretation of reality, in which individuals begin to share similar
perspectives and preferences. We test this idea across 3 aims by first characterizing the basic mechanisms
underlying social reward-seeking behaviors using ecologically-valid stimuli (e.g., posting personal photos on
social media). We then use a naturalistic paradigm to create shared affective experiences and examine the role
of communicating shared preferences in forming social bonds in Aim 2. Finally, we recognize that shared
preferences may also make it difficult for behavior to change if such preferences converge on maladaptive
behaviors such as nicotine use. We explore this idea in Aim 3 by examining mechanisms underlying social
reward-seeking in a nicotine-dependent population, while also considering how shared preferences may impact
behavior. Taken together, the proposed studies will use ecologically-valid stimuli and naturalistic paradigms to
delineate the mechanisms of how social rewards, which signal shared preferences, shape social reward-seeking
behaviors, facilitate social connection and may mitigate (or promote) cravings for substances in nicotine users.
Importantly, this work will lay the groundwork for future proposals to investigate the role of the dynamics of social
connection in substance abuse.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：The ongoing rapid and widespread transmission of SARS-CoV-2 across the world has resulted in myriad viral
strains, but human immunity has been acquired from vaccination against a single (Wuhan-Hu-1) strain and/or
previous infection with a handful of strains. The large number of substitutions present in the recently emerged
Omicron Variant of Concern (VOC) spike (S) protein's receptor-binding domain (RBD) – a key antigenic site –
are associated with immune evasion and a putative broadening of species tropism. Immune evasion may have
serious consequences, potentially leading to increased incidence of infection, reinfection and/or further
enhancing viral fitness during uncontrolled spread around the globe. Omicron has not directly descended from
any of the previously identified VOCs raising the specter of future, highly-substituted immune-evasive VOCs.
Prior knowledge of the space of potential variants may enable the development of active and passive
immunization strategies for blunting the damage caused by novel VOCs. However, the scientific community
currently lacks the tools to prospectively identify novel highly-substituted VOCs capable of immune evasion. In
Aim 1 we propose a pipeline for discovering a diverse set of heavily substituted and immune-evasive RBD
variants. Relatedly, the medical community lacks binding-based therapeutic passive immunization leads against
unknown future variants that can be deployed in the event of a novel VOC outbreak. For example, many
monoclonal antibody therapies that previously received emergency use authorization from FDA no longer
neutralize the Omicron VOC, leading to fewer clinically relevant pharmaceutical interventions. For Aim 2, we
propose to redesign existing small-protein-based therapeutic entities to bind nearly all possible prospectively
identified novel VOCs. Our proposal is enabled by results from the PI and co-I laboratories, in which we
developed high-throughput structure-based computational and experimental approaches for predicting and
characterizing the binding of diverse SARS-CoV-2 RBD variants with the ACE2 and a set of neutralizing
antibodies (nAbs) to effectively recapitulate variant S function and immune evasion properties. We will apply our
technologies to broadly sample heavily substituted (10-20 substitutions) but functional RBD variants and identify
those that are predicted to abrogate binding to a representative set of neutralizing antibodies raised against two
key (Class 1 and Class 2) epitope regions of the RBD. Experimentally validated classes of escape-competent
RBD variants will serve as targets for the design of small protein-based inhibitors. The overall impact of this
project will be the prospective identification of the space of possible variation in Class 1 and Class 2 epitopes
that can still be recognized by the prevalent immune response. This will aid therapeutic intervention and identify
candidate RBD variant immunogens for inclusion in next-generation vaccines. This project will also provide
potent inhibitors of the diverse highly substituted RBD variants. With further clinical development, these may
serve as off-the-shelf therapeutics for effectively stopping a new VOC in its tracks.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Intrathecal oxytocin (OT) is in clinical trials as an opioid alternative for chronic pain treatment. Our work in mice
suggests that coupling intrathecal oxytocin with manual therapies (i.e. massage) optimizes the analgesic
properties of oxytocin. This project provides the framework to support this combination therapy by concentrating
on the spinal cord circuit mechanisms by which oxytocin alleviates pain. Our preliminary studies suggest that
oxytocin-specific spinal cord circuits are embedded within a previously uncharacterized dorsal horn
nociceptive/affective touch circuit. We will carry out three complementary sets of experiments to test the overall
hypothesis that oxytocin alleviates pain by balancing excitation, inhibition, nociception, and affective touch to
sculpt the activity of spinal projections systems that carry both negative valences (associated with noxious
stimuli), and signals associated with positive valence (like the pleasurable properties of touch). Pharmacological
and behavioral studies in rodents suggest that spinal cord oxytocin receptors (OTRs) mediate intrathecal
oxytocin-induced analgesia. In Aim 1 we map the distribution of OTR+ interneurons within the dorsal horn of
female and male mice, rats, and humans. In Aim 2, we map the specific input/output profiles of OTR+INs. Here
we test the hypothesis that inhibitory and excitatory OTR+INs integrate peripheral nociceptive/affective touch
information with OT to differentially regulate the activity of molecularly defined Lamina I projection neurons. In
Aim 3 we assay the contribution of OT spinal cord circuits to both sensory-evoked reflexes and affective-
motivational pain. For Aim 3 we implement our recently developed computational approaches to scale sensory-
reflexive and affective-motivational pain. Results from our human tissue studies will inform how our
interpretations of our rodent studies may be applied to human therapies. Based on our unique expertise in touch-
specific spinal cord circuits, access to a large repertoire of spinal cord-specific tools, and behavior analytics that
match the granularity of our circuit dissection techniques, we are uniquely poised to provide the theoretical
framework for this combination therapy. In addition to informing context and condition for OT delivery, this work
may also be used in the clinic to adjust OT dosage and delivery method. This project is impactful for several
other reasons: 1) using computer vision/machine learning we will uncover the specific aspects of the pain
experience that are alleviated by spinal cord OT, and assess efficacy against other analgesics; 2) our
computational approaches to objectively scale rodent pain can be easily shared and implemented across
research groups, serving as a blueprint to standardize rodent pain assessment (see Resource Sharing); 3) our
general approach and model can serve as a basic blueprint for testing how other neuromodulators are
functionally integrated into spinal cord circuits of touch and nociception; and; 4) this type of foundational work
informs innovative approaches to disentangle the sensory from the emotional experiences of pain, inspiring new
therapies to treat each uniquely.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Down syndrome (DS), caused by triplication of human chromosome 21 (HSA21), is the most common genetic
origin of intellectual disability. Studying DS disease mechanism is challenging because functional human DS
brain tissues are scarcely available and transgenic mouse models of DS demonstrate incomplete/inaccurate
expression of HSA21 genes. The advent of human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) technology has led to
the generation of DS patient-derived hiPSCs, which presents an unprecedented opportunity for studying the
pathogenesis of DS with unlimited human brain cells in vitro. While using the hiPSC-based in vitro models, basic
aspects of the disease phenotypes can be examined, the disruption of neural circuits in the developing brain
under disease conditions remains to be studied with hiPSCs. Ultimately, specific developmental and disease
mechanisms can only be modeled in live animals to identify links between cellular phenotypes and behavioral
performance. Therefore, we propose to employ hiPSC-based chimeric mouse brain models to study the
neuropathophysiology of DS in vivo. Microglia play critical roles in brain development and are also an active
player in learning and memory processes. Surprisingly, very little information is available on how trisomy of
HSA21 alters the development and functions of microglia and what roles microglia play in the abnormal brain
development and cognitive deficits in DS. In addition, mounting evidence indicates that rodent microglia are not
able to fully mirror the properties of human microglia in normal and disease conditions. In this study, we will use
our recently created hiPSC microglial chimeric mouse model to unravel the role of microglia in DS pathogenesis
in an in vivo system with intact neural networks. We hypothesize that unlike engrafted normal human microglia,
engrafted diseased DS human microglia will show abnormal biological properties and functions, such as synaptic
pruning function in vivo. These abnormal properties of DS microglia will result in their negative regulation of the
synaptic activity and plasticity of the hippocampal neural network, critically contributing to the cognitive deficits
seen in DS. This hypothesis will be tested in three specific aims. Aim 1: we will determine the differences between
DS and control hiPSC-derived microglia in vivo in human microglial chimeric mouse brains. Aim 2: Using the
microglial chimeric mouse model, we will further examine the impact of integration of DS microglia on synaptic
plasticity of the hippocampus and learning and memory behavior of the animals. Aim 3: We will normalize the
expression of the HSA21 genes by CRISPR/Cas9 to examine how this will alter the properties of DS microglia.
Moreover, single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis of hiPSC microglial chimeric mouse brains will be performed to
compare gene expression profiles of control and DS microglia. Findings from our study using a powerful, new
hiPSC microglial chimeric mouse model will provide novel insights into the pathological roles of human microglia
in DS. Identifying the potential molecules that can be targeted to improve microglial function may provide a new
therapeutic avenue for the treatment of DS.

 Astrocytes are versatile glial cells that regulate diverse processes in the central nervous system (CNS).
Roles for astrocytes during disease are complex and include both protective and pathologic functions. Recently,
distinct astrocyte activation states have been described, though the molecular mechanisms that govern astrocyte
polarization during neurotropic viral infection are not well understood. Here, we propose that receptor-interacting
protein kinase-3 (RIPK3) is a previously unappreciated driver of inflammatory astrocyte activation during viral
infection of the CNS. While roles for RIPK3 in programmed cell death have been extensively characterized, our
published work has described pleiotropic, cell death-independent functions for this pathway in the coordination
of protective neuroinflammation during viral encephalitis. In preliminary studies, we now show that RIPK3
signaling in astrocytes is required for survival and virologic control following challenge with Zika virus, an
emerging neurotropic pathogen of global concern. Using a combination of novel mouse genetic tools, we will
elucidate roles for RIPK3 signaling in astrocytes by 1) Defining profiles of expression, activation, and antiviral
function for astrocytic RIPK3; 2) Determining roles for astrocytic RIPK3 signaling in coordinating
neuroinflammation; and 3) Defining key substrates and transcriptional outputs of RIPK3 signaling in astrocytes.
Together, our studies promise to identify new molecular mechanisms governing protective neuroimmune function
during viral encephalitis.

Our current understanding of chromatin transcription has been limited by our knowledge of the factors that are
involved in this process. In this regard, we have identified a novel nucleosome destabilization factor, termed
NDF, that can destabilize nucleosomes and facilitate transcription elongation through nucleosomes. In this
proposal, we will investigate the function of NDF in chromatin dynamics and RNA Polymerase II transcription
elongation using biochemistry, genomics, bioinformatics and structural biology approaches. In Specific Aim 1,
we will develop and employ new methods and strategies to study the molecular mechanism of NDF-mediated
nucleosome destabilization and RNA Polymerase II transcription. We will use ultra-high-resolution optical
tweezer as well as cryo-electron microscopy to characterize the dynamics of NDF-mediated nucleosome
destabilization. In Specific Aim 2, we will examine how NDF is recruited to the transcribed regions of active
genes in cells. We will assess whether other cellular factors, other than H3K36me3 histones, contribute to the
recruitment of NDF. In Specific Aim 3, we will determine how genes lacking NDF are transcribed, and
investigate protein factors that are related to NDF. The studies proposed here should significantly increase our
understanding of the mechanisms of Pol II transcription elongation through chromatin.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
Harboring active transposable elements (TEs) imposes a substantial mutational burden on the host genome. To
reduce this burden, most organisms have evolved sophisticated, and often multi-layered, mechanisms for
identifying and inactivating TEs. In spite of these defenses, active TEs are found in the genomes of almost all
eukaryotes. One explanation for the evolutionary persistence of TEs is that they are in an “arms race” with their
host genome: TEs are constantly evolving novels ways to block or evade host silencing while the host genome
is continuously evolving to re-establish TE suppression. While this theory is appealing, there is a gap in
knowledge because the mechanisms by which TEs could block or evade host defenses are largely unknown.
The long-term goal of this applicant’s laboratory is to understand the evolutionary dynamics of TE/host co-
evolution. The overall objective of this project is to understand and functionally validate a novel TE strategy,
discovered in the applicant’s laboratory, that involves TEs using their own piRNAs to target host silencing factors
for suppression. Preliminary data produced in the applicant’s laboratory suggests that the Drosophila
melanogaster telomeric transposon TART-A captured a portion of the host TE silencing factor nxf2, which allows
TART-A to produce piRNAs targeting nxf2 for suppression. The rationale for the proposed research is that it will
provide critical insight into the mechanisms of host-TE conflict and how TE counter-defense strategies can
impact host gene expression and fitness. The objective of this project will be achieved by pursuing three specific
aims: 1) Identify genes acquired by telomeric TEs across Drosophila; 2) Determine whether non-telomeric
transposons also use a piRNA-mediated counter-silencing strategy; and 3) Disrupt TE counter-silencing using
CRISPR in D. melanogaster. Telomeric TEs will be identified in 28 species of Drosophila and assayed to
determine whether they have acquired host gene fragments. The applicant’s laboratory has identified 45
candidate genes in D. melanogaster that share homology with TE-derived piRNAs and are known to play a role
in TE suppression. These genes will be tested to determine if they suppress the same TE with which they share
homology. Candidate TE/gene pairs will be validated using CRISPR genome editing to erase their shared
homology, which should result in upregulation of the gene in question. The proposed research is innovative
because it represents a substantial departure from the status quo: instead of the host-centric view of previous
studies, which examine how the genome responds to TE activity, this project will study the TE side of the equation
by investigating how TEs respond to and counteract host defenses. One of the major goals of the field is to
understand why host genes involved in TE silencing are rapidly evolving. The proposed research is significant
because it will support this goal by characterizing and functionally validating a specific TE counter-defense
strategy, which will provide empirical support for the arms race theory, while also increasing understanding of
the co-evolutionary dynamics between host genomes and their TE associates.

loci are present in almost all archaea and half of eubacteria. They protect prokaryotes from foreign
genetic elements. While highly diverse, all CRISPR-Cas systems function through three common steps:
1) adaptation, i.e., acquisition of short foreign DNA sequences (spacers) into CRISPR arrays; 2)
production of mature protective CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs), and 3) interference, when Cas nucleases
guided by crRNAs destroy nucleic acids containing complementary targets. Studies of the interference
part of CRISPR response have revolutionized the field of genomic editing. The less-studied adaptation
part limits global horizontal gene transfer and can be harnessed for creation of DNA-based recording
devices and control of the spread of antibiotic resistance genes. Initial CRISPR immunity is built in the
course of “naïve”, non-discriminate acquisition of short intracellular DNA molecules – prespacers - as
spacers into CRISPR arrays. It occurs very infrequently and can lead to suicidal self-interference. A
remarkable mechanism called “priming” operates in type I CRISPR-Cas systems: acquisition of spacers
from DNA with sequences matching pre-existing spacers is dramatically stimulated compared to naïve
acquisition from DNA devoid of such sequences. Primed adaptation is highly beneficial to the host: it
rapidly leads to specific acquisition of additional interference-proficient spacers from genetic parasites
and ensures that no self-targeting spacers are selected. The mechanistic relationship between
interference and adaptation during priming is not fully clear. The goal of this proposal is to dissect
interrelationships between interference and adaptation during priming and to identify cellular processes
that feed the adaptation machinery during naïve and primed adaptation. We will use FragSeq - an
innovative high-throughput approach that identifies short intracellular DNA fragments and that was
developed during the previous funding period - to determine the structure of prespacers and of other in
vivo adaptation intermediates generated during naïve and primed adaptation in diverse CRISPR-Cas
systems classes and types, and identify non-Cas cellular proteins essential for prespacer generation and
spacer acquisition. The understanding of CRISPR adaptation that will result from our work will allow us
and others to optimize the efficiency of the adaptation process, facilitating construction of strains with
desired spacer content/immunity profiles and, by revealing processes that limit adaptation, may help
control viability of bacterial populations by inducing adaptation from cell’s own DNA and self-interference.

PI: Darrin M. York, Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ 08854-8087 USA.
 RNA enzymes (ribozymes) are fundamental in biology, and have important applications in chemistry, biotech-
nology and medicine. The scientiﬁc community is still in early stages of discovery, and the full breadth of poten-
tially transformative RNA and related nucleic acid based technology and therapeutics have yet to be realized. A
critical barrier to progress toward this realization is the lack of a predictive understanding of ribozyme mechanisms
that can be used to guide design. This proposal addresses this critical barrier by the creation of new enabling
technology to study RNA enzymes (Aim 1) that will be applied to small self-cleaving (nucleolytic) ribozymes (Aim
2), and artiﬁcially engineered self-alkylating and methyltransferase ribozymes and a naturally occurring group I
intron ribozyme (Aim 3). Predictive insight gained from these studies will unveil general principles crucial for our
understanding of RNA catalysis and the rational design of new ribozyme-based biomedical technology.
 Aim 1 will create advanced tools for computational RNA enzymology, including 1) new fast/accurate quan-
tum+machine learning force ﬁelds for RNA catalysis, 2) integrated software for inclusion of nuclear quantum
effects, and 3) robust methods for determination of reaction paths and free energy surfaces (including corrections
to expensive high-level ab initio surfaces). These methods are signiﬁcant as enabling technology to study mech-
anisms of RNA catalysis. The goal of this aim is develop innovative technology designed to meet the needs of the
driving ribozyme applications in Aims 2 and 3, as well as many applications outside the scope of the proposal.
 Aim 2 will apply our computational enzymology tools to study the catalytic mechanisms of small nucleolytic
ribozymes (Psr, HHr and HDVr) and a related artiﬁcially engineered DNAzyme (8-17dz). These systems are
important as tools for chemical and molecular biology, and as tractable models for RNA/DNA catalysis. The
goal of this aim is to apply and further develop general principles for RNA-cleaving nucleic acid enzyme design,
building on our L-platform/L-scaffold framework for naturally occurring “G+A” and “G+M” ribozyme classes.
 Aim 3 will explore mechanisms of artiﬁcially engineered self-alkylating ribozyme (SAR) and methyl transferase
ribozyme (MTR1), and the naturally occurring Tetrahymena group I intron (THr) ribozyme. These systems have
far-reaching implications for biotechnology and medicine. The goal of this aim is to examine the extent to which
design principles can be extended and transferred to these systems to provide deeper insight into the diverse
array of catalytic strategies available to nucleic acid enzymes.
 Working together, these aims will accomplish the overarching goal to achieve a predictive understanding of
ribozyme mechanisms that can be used to guide the design of new technology and therapeutics.

 Cilia play essential roles in human development and health. Ciliary ubiquity and diversity are reflected
in multi-symptom ciliopathies caused by ciliary defects. The clinical severity of ciliopathy gene mutations varies
between cell types and includes cystic kidney disease, neurological and skeletal defects, retinal degeneration,
situs inversus, and male infertility. While the same basic intraflagellar transport (IFT) machinery constructs all
cilia and flagella, the mechanisms underlying ciliary specialization are poorly understood. For example, cilia
produce extracellular vesicles (EVs). Whether EV shedding is a general property of cilia or a specialized
feature of some cilia types is unknown. The functions of ciliary EVs and their contributions to ciliopathies are
also poorly understood. The long-term goal of this project is to identify molecular mechanisms regulating ciliary
specialization, remodeling, plasticity, EV biogenesis, and EV functions. Cilia of the C. elegans inner labial-type
2 (IL2) neurons display several specializations: they have unique microtubule ultrastructure, specialized IFT,
and shed EVs. The IL2 ciliary transition zone (TZ) and axoneme is structurally plastic and remodels from one
structure to another during animal development: from a canonical 9+0 to non-canonical 6+0 structure. While
cilia and flagella share a 9-fold microtubule doublet symmetry, variations in microtubule numbers are observed
in nature. Renal primary cilia do not conform to the 9 + 0 paradigm. This developmental plasticity suggests that
some ciliary defects (ciliopathies) may be corrected at later times. Our hypothesis is supported by the recent
discovery that autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease is reversible, and that the kidney displays
structural plasticity. Our simple C. elegans model allows us to uncover mechanisms that regulate ciliary
remodeling and plasticity. We found that TZ remodeling requires IFT and the tubulin code – combinatorial use
of tubulin isotypes, glutamylation, and microtubule-associated proteins. Nephronophthisis-related ciliopathies
(NPHP-RCs) are associated with defects in TZ-associated proteins. NPHP-RCs include nephronophthisis,
Meckel Gruber (MKS), Joubert (JBTS), and Senior-Løken syndromes. The clinical severity of loss of function of
NPHP-RC genes varies between cell and cilia types, thus it is imperative to understand ciliary and EV biology
in a variety of contexts. We will use C. elegans to identify mechanisms driving transition zone and axonemal
remodeling and plasticity in non-canonical primary cilia. Ciliary EV shedding is a conserved, yet little is known
about how and why cilia make EVs. We will test the hypotheses that ciliary remodeling and a non-canonical
structure impacts EV biogenesis and EV function.

Mental disorders, including major depressive disorder, schizophrenia, and others, all share a central feature –
cognitive impairment which results in individuals confronted with difficulty in memory, concentration, and
decision-making. Emerging evidence points to two key factors contributing to cognitive decline beyond the
underlying disease pathology - exposure to 1) environmental chemicals such as endocrine disrupting
compounds (EDCs) during development and 2) chronic stress in adulthood. The interaction of chemical
exposure and stress are unknown; but together may exacerbate cognitive impairment. First, EDCs exert their
toxicity by disrupting nuclear receptor signaling during sensitive brain developmental periods. Numerous EDC
studies have detected cognitive impairments in humans and animals. One group of understudied EDCs are
organophosphate flame retardants (OPFRs) acting on nuclear and steroid receptors linked with cognition. The
association between perinatal OPFR exposure and cognitive processing has not been explored. We previously
identified an association between perinatal OPFR exposure on neonatal and juvenile hypothalamic gene
expression and adult locomotor activity and approach/avoidance behaviors. Second, mental disorders share a
common feature: exposure to stress, which contributes to cognitive dysfunction by exacerbating symptoms. A
common paradigm to recapitulate chronic stressors in rodents is to apply mild stress for 6 weeks, known as
chronic variable mild stress (CVMS). Using CVMS, the neural circuits underlying maladaptive effects of stress
include corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) neurons. CRF is co-released with norepinephrine (NE), acetylcholine
(ACh), and dopamine (DA), which control key brain regions (hippocampus, prefrontal cortex), and all are involved
in cognition and mood. Based on our prior work and the literature, I hypothesize that perinatal OPFR exposure
can disrupt cognition, alone or when combined with adult chronic stress exposure. My central hypothesis is
that EDCs such as OPFRs influence the developing cognitive and stress neurocircuitry potentially
inducing long-lasting functional deficits in cognitive processing and sensitize adults to exposure to
chronic stress in mice. In Aim 1 (K99 phase), I will first determine if perinatal OPFR exposure disrupts adult
cognition on the behavioral level and through alterations in ACh synaptic transmission using electrophysiology.
In Aim 2 (K99), I will examine the effects of OPFR exposure on regional concentrations of NE and DA and CRF
and associated gene expression in adults, and the role of hippocampal CRF neurons using optogenetics. Lastly,
in Aim 3 (R00), I will combine my prior expertise in spine density analysis and immunohistochemistry, and new
training in electrophysiology, high-performance liquid chromatography, and optogenetics to determine if the
combination of perinatal OPFR exposure and adult CVMS alters cognition. The ultimate goal of my research
program will be to determine the interactions of perinatal EDC exposure and adult chronic stressors on cognitive
processing by influencing CRF and neurotransmitter signaling throughout the brain.

Transposable elements (TEs), like viruses, are genetic parasites. They use their host’s cellular machinery to
replicate and must replicate faster than their host to avoid extinction. Replication of TEs in host cells causes
damaging mutations: TE insertions can inactivate host genes and cause chromosomal rearrangements. Host
genomes have therefore evolved sophisticated silencing pathways to identify TEs and suppress their
replication activity. However, active TEs remain present in the genomes of almost all eukaryotes. One
explanation for their persistence over evolutionary time is that, like viruses, TEs evolve rapidly to escape host
silencing, which in turn selects for an adaptive response from the host, thus locking TEs and their hosts into an
evolutionary arms race. Unlike viruses, whose immune evasion strategies have been well-studied, the
mechanisms by which TEs are able to escape host silencing are relatively unknown. The overall goal of our
research program is to understand strategies used by TEs to escape host silencing and how such strategies
affect host phenotypes and/or disease states.
Our research is currently focused on three such strategies: (1) Permissive niches for TE mobilization: one way
TEs can escape host silencing is by preferentially mobilizing in vulnerable cell types and/or being transcribed
highly enough to overwhelm host defenses. Our goal for this research direction is to identify novel permissive
niches and understand the mechanisms TEs use to gain expression in these cell types. (2) Host gene capture
by TEs: Drosophila telomeres are composed of specialized retrotransposons that replicate onto the
chromosome ends. These elements likely evolve in conflict with their host despite serving an essential cellular
function. We have identified telomeric retrotransposons in over 100 species of Drosophila and found that these
elements have repeatedly captured fragments of host TE silencing genes. Our goal for this research direction
is to understand this gene capture phenomenon and how it is used by TEs to evade host silencing. (3) TE
derepression in species hybrids: hybrid dysgenesis occurs in F1 progeny when a TE is present in the paternal
genome but missing from the maternal genome. Small RNAs that target such a TE are therefore unable to be
supplied to the embryo by the mother and the TE becomes hyperactivated in the progeny, usually resulting in
DNA damage, sterility, and gonadal atrophy. We have discovered a novel exception to this phenomenon where
a gypsy family TE is massively upregulated in F1 progeny without an obvious effect on fertility. This situation
provides a unique opportunity for studying post-transcriptional regulation of TE activity.

 The current understanding of vitamin A metabolism in extrahepatic tissues is that hepatic retinoid stores are
mobilized as retinol bound to retinol-binding protein 4 (RBP4) and delivered through the circulation to the cells
where they are taken up and used for all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) synthesis and ATRA-mediated transcriptional
regulation. Our preliminary data challenge this paradigm and indicate that retinoids are delivered to the lung
predominantly via circulating lipoproteins, a previously ignored pathway for retinoid delivery involving the action of
lipoprotein-metabolizing proteins. We found from our novel studies employing single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-
seq) of cells possessing vitamin A fluorescence that lipofibroblasts (LFs), endothelial (ECs), and epithelial cells
(AECs) all accumulate retinoids in form of retinyl esters (REs) and all express key genes needed to allow for
postprandial lipoprotein-derived vitamin A uptake, storage, and intercellular transport. Moreover, our mouse model
studies compellingly establish that the mice lacking locally stored retinoids in the lung develop more severe acute
lung injury resulting in death due to the loss of alveolar barrier integrity and impaired surfactant production. This
occurs even though mice are fed a nutritional complete chow diet, circulating vitamin A levels are normal, and the
animals are not otherwise vitamin A-insufficient. These findings lead us to hypothesize that lipoprotein-derived and
locally stored cellular vitamin A is preferentially processed, as opposed to circulating or systemic retinol, for ATRA
synthesis and signaling via nuclear retinoic acid receptors (RARs). We are proposing in-depth studies to explore
the metabolic consequences of vitamin A transport and how local vitamin A stores are acquired, metabolized, and
processed to mount protective cellular responses. Aim 1 will delineate the mechanisms that allow ECs, LFs, and
AEC2s to take up, accumulate, and intercellularly transfer retinoids. We will determine how retinoids are taken up
by these cells from circulating lipoproteins and redistributed among them. This will be achieved by kinetic studies
employing tracer labeling of retinoids in mice lacking cell-specific expression of Lpl, Cd36, and Lrp1 as well as in
cultured mouse and human cells coupled with lipidomics analyses. Aim 2 will establish how alterations in vitamin
A stores, which are primarily located in intracellular lipid droplets of the LFs, define the transcriptional and
phenotypic identity of the LF population. Using scRNA-seq molecular profiling coupled with immunohistochemical
spatial analysis of labeled retinoid-containing LFs, we will characterize how exposure to lipoprotein-derived
retinoids defines quiescent and profibrotic LF identity in vivo. Aim 3 will determine the crosstalk mechanisms by
which LF-derived retinoids regulate ATRA-RAR-mediated cellular functions of ECs and AEC2s. Employing genetic
and pharmacological manipulations of retinoid signaling via RARs in AEC2s and ECs coupled with lipidomics
analyses, we will dissect the crosstalk mechanisms underlying the role of LF-derived retinoids in cell-specific ATRA
signaling to regulate endothelial barrier integrity and surfactant lipid production. To further define underlying ATRA-
RAR-mediated mechanisms, we will employ human AEC2s and ECs co-cultured with retinoid-containing LFs.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Ricin, one of the most toxic substances known and a type B biothreat agent, has the same mechanism of
action as Shiga toxins (Stxs) produced by E. coli (STEC) and Shigella dysenteriae, which are foodborne
pathogens responsible for significant morbidity and mortality around the world. Despite years of research there
are no effective small molecule inhibitors of ricin or Stxs and as of now only supportive care is available.
Modulation of ribosome interactions by small molecules has not been previously explored as a strategy for
inhibition. We showed that ricin toxin A subunit (RTA) and the A1 subunit of Stx2a (Stx2A1) bind to the C-
terminal domain (CTD) of the ribosomal P-stalk proteins to depurinate the sarcin/ricin loop (SRL) at a distant
site on the large subunit of the ribosome. We identified the critical residues at the P-stalk binding site of RTA
and Stx2A1 and reported the first X-ray crystal structure of Stx2a with a P protein peptide and the first cryo-EM
structure of Stx2a holotoxin with the purified P-stalk pentamer. Peptides mimicking the CTD of P proteins bind
at a hydrophobic pocket on the opposite face of RTA/Stx2A1 relative to the active site and inhibit the activity of
both toxins, identifying the P-stalk binding site as a new target for developing small molecules. We set up
fragment-based lead discovery (FBLD) by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and discovered two fragments
that bind at the P-stalk binding site of RTA. Using structure-based design (SAR) we improved these inhibitors
and obtained lead compounds that inhibit the activity and cytotoxicity of ricin and Stx2a holotoxin in
mammalian cells. In this revised application, we propose to use a new fluorescence polarization assay to
enable robust SAR evaluation and the design of second-generation lead compounds that inhibit the activity of
ricin and Stx2a. We will test the hypothesis that the hydrophobic pocket at the P-stalk binding site of RTA and
Stx2A1 can serve as a highly druggable site for developing small molecules that can be used to dissect the
depurination mechanism of the ribosome inactivating proteins. In aim one, we will design new analogs based
on trends in SAR revealed from our recent work, to improve binding interactions while improving physical
properties. We will use docking and binding site analysis by SiteMap, WaterMap and FEP+ to optimize our
leads. We will determine the affinities using a new fluorescence polarization assay, analyze potency in cell-free
and cell-based assays and identify the binding modes by X-ray crystallography and NMR. A supplemental
virtual screen against RTA will be used to identify new chemical scaffolds and new binding elements to
combine with our current leads. In the second aim, we will use NMR analysis to investigate the mechanism of
action of lead compounds to test the hypothesis that P-stalk binding indirectly influences the active site
residues to allosterically regulate depurination activity at the catalytic site of RTA and Stx2A1. The product of
our efforts will be chemical tools to elucidate P-stalk binding and activation mechanisms and may result in
advanced lead compounds for the development of post-exposure therapeutics against ricin and STEC.

Life and Death in the Nursery will analyze the emergence of a new subspecialty – neonatology – and the
medical technologies employed by neonatologists. The development of new sophisticated machinery
meant that clinicians were now able to keep infants alive who in earlier years would have died. In the
1960s, hospitals around the country established NICUs. Clinicians and parents approached this highly
technological world with worries over the health and lives of severely ill newborns and negotiated
significant medical ethics questions about life, death, and quality of life. They debated these questions
within the emerging bioethics’ movement and in a larger social and cultural context in which attitudes
about reproduction, disability, quality of life, and death and dying shaped their respective understanding
about the ethics surrounding life and death. I will investigate how health care providers and parents
experienced the NICU, how it shaped their identity, and what impact their personal position and
understanding of neonatology had on their clinical experiences. The book will focus on the impact that
changes in medical technologies, reproductive politics, our understanding of disabilities, and attitudes
about race had on clinical care and the ways these changes shaped medicine in the NICU. This analysis
not only sheds light on the history of neonatology itself, but also points to ongoing dilemmas in
medicine: decisions about the continuation/ discontinuation of therapies at the edges of life and death,
as well as the pervasive existence of health inequities. Clinical issues inside the NICU are embedded in a
larger context of women’s reproductive health care. Much happens to women, their pregnancies, and
fetuses before infants enter the NICU and these events determine the problems with which infants
present. How women become pregnant, what kinds of screening and prenatal care they receive, their
access to abortion care, and how they give birth has changed significantly over the course of the last six
decades, leading to concomitant shifts in the demographic characteristics and clinical problems of NICU
patients. Taking the NICU as a focal point, my study addresses larger questions about life, death, and
quality of life that continue to be of importance in clinical care – in the NICU and beyond: How do
therapies, treatments, and procedures in one medical specialty shape the clinical problems in another?
How should clinicians balance rapid technological and therapeutic innovation with the development of
standards of care? In an area of rapid innovation, where therapies quickly move from experimental to
innovative, routine, and outdated, how do researchers adhere to treatment protocols and informed
consent? And how do patients and family members understand and participate in clinical decision
making in a specialty where so much seems at stake and hopes are so high?

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Abstract: Tourette Syndrome (TS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by urges to perform tics
which are repetitive, stereotyped, and uncontrollable movements or sounds. The CDC estimates that TS and
related chronic tic disorders affect ~1 in 50 children. Despite the high prevalence, the underlying neuropathology
is poorly understood. A lack of preclinical animal models is a large reason for this current impasse in TS research.
This grant proposes a new way to overcome this barrier using novel mouse models generated in our lab that
express orthologous human mutations identified in a high-confidence TS gene, CELSR3. Preliminary data shows
these mice exhibit tic-like stereotypies in the open field, with sex-dependent variable expressivity, and also
changes to striatal dopamine. Leveraging these novel mice with construct and face validity, I will test the
hypothesis that tics are associated with changes to habit formation and dopamine signaling. Habits and tics are
highly similar: they are both repetitive, stereotyped, and automated actions that once formed are hard to break.
It is proposed in TS that a potentiation of sensorimotor inputs onto striatal circuits regulating habit formation
along with potentially weaker engagement of circuits controlling goal-directed behavior may predispose
individuals to develop ‘tic-habits’. Further, ‘tic-habits’ may be perpetuated by aberrant DA signaling, which
reinforces and motivates these learned behaviors. Human studies have demonstrated that TS probands develop
habits quicker, an effect not seen in medicated probands on DA stabilizers (aripiprazole). Additionally, habit
reversal therapy is proven to help decrease tics in ~40% of TS subjects, further suggesting a link between habits
and tics. However, these findings have yet to be tested and confirmed in animal models, and the
neurodevelopmental circuit changes regulating habit formation in TS remain uninvestigated. Similar to human
findings, my preliminary data suggests Celsr3 TS mice form habits faster and have difficultly breaking them (akin
to difficulty seen in ceasing to tic). Interestingly, some tic-like stereotypies are more pronounced in female mice,
suggesting sex-differences need to be explored. Thus, I hypothesize Celsr3 TS mice will demonstrate enhanced
habitual responding and changes to DA signaling during early stages of habit formation, which may be influenced
by sex. I also hypothesize that these phenotypes will be normalized with aripiprazole, as observed in human
subjects. In Aim 1, I will use instrumental learning paradigms to test if habit formation and goal-directed behaviors
are enhanced and/or weakened, respectively. Deciphering potential circuit imbalances between these two
systems will provide insight into neurodevelopmental circuit changes proposed in TS. In Aim 2, I will use in vivo
imaging and fiber photometry to investigate DA signaling while mice form habits. I will also administer aripiprazole
to test if I can normalize habitual behavior to control levels. These experiments will be the first to investigate
habit formation and DA dysregulation in TS using bona fide TS mouse models with true construct and face
validity. These results will help explain the neurobiological basis of tics, helping to improve treatment strategies.

Research into the mechanisms underlying methamphetamine craving, a key driver of relapse, is dwarfed in
comparison to other drugs of abuse (e.g., cocaine, opioids). Exacerbated drug craving can be modeled in rats
using the incubation of methamphetamine craving paradigm. The nucleus accumbens plays a key role in
mediating drug seeking which intensifies commensurate with abstinence duration. Approximately 95% of
accumbens neurons are GABAergic medium spiny neurons which can be distinguished by expression of the
D1 dopamine receptors (D1DRs) or D2 dopamine receptors (D2DRs), although a relatively small proportion of
these cells express both of these receptors. Canonically, D1DR-containing neurons were thought to project
exclusively to the ventral tegmental area, whereas D2DR-expressing accumbens efferents extended to the
ventral pallidum; however, recent evidence suggests that there is some overlap such that D1DR-containing
neurons also project to the ventral pallidum and modulate drug seeking. Generally, D1DR-containing neurons
promote drug-related behaviors, whereas D2DR-containing neurons inhibit drug-related behaviors. Importantly,
the influence of specific projections of these neuronal subtypes on methamphetamine seeking is unknown.
Specific Aim 1 will combine D1DR-Cre and D2DR-Cre transgenic rats, optogenetics, and electrophysiology to
dissociate the role of D1DR- vs. D2DR-containing striatopallidal and striatotegmental projections in the
incubation of methamphetamine craving. The time-dependent molecular adaptations within accumbens D1DR-
containing and D2DR-containing neurons that occur during abstinence from methamphetamine are also
unexplored. Very recent advances in single cell sequencing methodologies have enabled simultaneous
profiling of the transcriptome and chromatin accessibility in defined cell populations. This is particularly relevant
for the current proposal since it will allow us to differentiate in silico effects in accumbens neurons which
express either the D1DR or D2DR. Specific Aim 2 will define the landscape of accessible chromatin and gene
expression by coupling ATAC sequencing and RNA sequencing from the same single nuclei droplets in rats
following short or prolonged abstinence from methamphetamine. Functional validation of a candidate gene will
be performed by bidirectionally manipulating gene expression in selectively in D1DR-containing or D2DR-
containing neurons and assessing the incubation of methamphetamine craving. Collectively, the proposed
studies will elucidate the neurocircuitry and molecular mechanisms underlying the incubation of
methamphetamine craving.

This proposal is a renewal application of R01 (AI130197). In the previous funding cycle, we sought to identify
the mechanism(s) by which the small adaptor protein Crk controls NK cell activation and inhibition, using
human NK cells and NK cell-specific conditional knockout mice. We found that Crk phosphorylation plays a key
role in function and that Crk haploinsufficiency leads to NK cell deficits and impaired integrin signaling.
Importantly, we identified new small molecule inhibitors of pCrk (Patent #: 63/305,354). In the proposed
renewal, we use this new tool to further dissect Crk’s ability to integrate activating and inhibitory input at the
immune synapse (IS) of both NK and T cells in a variety of relevant settings: in high-resolution live human
primary cell imaging assays, in human Crk haploinsufficiency, and in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). We
test our central hypothesis that Crk functions as a master regulatory switch, fine-tuning activating and
inhibitory influences via interactions with downstream molecules and the actin cytoskeleton, and propose the
new hypothesis that pCrk inhibition can restore exhausted immune responses in cancer via novel signaling
pathways. Guided by strong preliminary data, we propose three Specific Aims: 1) How does Crk function as
a master regulatory switch to control NK cell function? Here, we use cutting-edge imaging systems, lipid
bilayers, live human primary cells, RNA-Seq, and our new CrkL inhibitors to determine where Crk, pCrk, and
their upstream and downstream partners localize in the cytotoxic, inhibitory, and exhausted IS, and how pCrk
inhibitors influence NK signaling in healthy and exhausted NK cells. 2) How does Crk influence immune
function and integrin signaling in pDGS T cells? Our previous program showed that NK cells from patients
with pDGS – a common genetic syndrome resulting from haploinsufficiency of CrkL-containing locus 22q11 –
exhibit functional NK cell deficiencies, as well as defective integrin activation at the IS. We expand these
studies to T cells, using primary pDGS patient cells and integrin conformation-specific antibodies to assess
how Crk functions as a two-way regulatory switch for CTL function. We present data that haploinsufficiency of
CRKL results in functional T cell deficits, and examine integrin signaling, T cell function, and IS quality with an
eye towards clinical application of small molecule LFA-1 agonists to restore pDGS-related functional immune
cell deficiencies. 3) Discover the role of pCrkL inhibitors in cancer immunotherapy. Our preliminary data
show that pCrk inhibitors significantly inhibit tumor growth, restore cytotoxicity of inhibitor receptor-dominant
immune cells, and enhance survival. We hypothesize that pCrk inhibitor-mediated solid tumor suppression
results from both direct tumor killing and restoration of exhausted immune cell function. In Aim 3, we use a
battery of TNBC mouse models to elucidate Crk’s molecular mechanisms in solid tumors, testing the impact of
Crk inhibition on tumor growth and cell death, immune cell function in the tumor microenvironment, and
metastasis. Our long-term goal is to develop new treatments for human immunodeficiencies and cancer.

Anxiety disorders such as panic disorders, generalized anxiety disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder
(PTSD) affect approximately 18% of the American population with a health care cost of more than $42 billion a
year, a significant burden to the US economy. Development and maintenance of anxiety disorders have been
attributed to persistent fear memories, inadequate fear extinction, and maladaptive avoidance behavior. Thus,
it is imperative to understand the neural mechanisms underlying aversive learning in order to be able to develop
efficacious treatments for these disorders. In this project, we will focus on understanding the involvement of the
insula, a brain region heavily involved not only in aversive learning in general but also processes determining
approach/avoidance behaviors. Specifically, using in-vivo single cell calcium imaging via miniscopes, we will
record activity patterns of insular single cell ensembles during fear learning when the aversive outcome
(footshock) is inescapable as well as when the aversive outcome is omitted (fear extinction; Aim1a) and when
it becomes escapable (avoidance learning; Aim1b). Finally, using a novel theoretical-computational approach
to functionally cluster fear learning single cell ensembles in the insula, we will predict whether mice will develop
extinction resistant fear or impaired avoidance learning (Aim2). Thus, in this proposal, we aim to investigate the
involvement of the insular single cell ensembles in aversive learning and develop a novel computational tool to
predict future maladaptive aversive learning phenotypes based on the neural signaling in the insula.

Replication protein A (RPA) is required for nearly every DNA repair and replication process. RPA binds single-
stranded DNA and interacts with dozens of proteins at sites of DNA maintenance. We are interested in the
protein complexes that form between RPA and other proteins when performing specific DNA repair tasks. The
current project examines RPA’s role as a central scaffold in uracil base excision repair. Our approach is to
manipulate the binding of RPA to Uracil DNA Glycosylase (UNG2) to examine the relevance of their
interaction. We have developed a strategy to covalently tether together RPA and UNG2 to form mini DNA
repair complexes that resemble the architecture of the two proteins when they interact in cells. Our Preliminary
Data demonstrates our success at forming RPA-UNG2 protein complexes in both cellular and recombinant
systems. This allows us to definitively determine how RPA functions as part of a protein complex with UNG2,
and complementary studies examine the effects of weakening their association. Specifically, Aim 1 uses
purified RPA and UNG2 constructs to examine the activity of the proteins alone or as part of a complex.
Binding and enzymatic experiments using synthetic DNA substrates will determine the structural nature of their
substrates in vivo. We focus specifically on the action of RPA and UNG2 at ssDNA-dsDNA junctions, their
known substrates, by preparing uracilated fork-like DNA structures that resemble replication forks found in the
nucleus. Aim 2 examines the RPA-UNG2 protein complex in human colorectal cells under conditions of uracil
stress that are induced by commonly used chemotherapeutic agents. The strength of RPA’s interaction with
UNG2 will be controlled and correlated with UNG2’s uracil excision efficiency at the replication fork. Finally,
additional cellular proteins that associate with RPA and UNG2 will be identified. The function of these proteins
will be examined in the context of multi-protein complexes that form during uracil base excision repair. The
targeted scope of this project examining RPA in base excision repair will facilitate our methodological
development, which will be widely adaptable for examining RPA-containing protein complexes in other DNA
repair processes.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), Lewy body disease, amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis (ALS), frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), and prion disease constitute a group
of neurogenerative diseases called proteinopathies. They are characterized by the accumulation
of aggregated and misfolded proteins in the central nervous system. The identities of the
aggregated disease proteins have been identified but how they work at a mechanistic level and
contribute to disease pathogenesis remains unclear. Moreover, despite having common co-
occurring pathology, little is known about the relationship between these proteinopathies,
complicating potential treatment options. Recent evidence has shown a link between the
mitochondrial-mediated clearance of aggregated proteins and the preservation of neuronal cell
integrity. Likewise, established model systems of proteinopathies have both demonstrated similar
results and carved a way to study the molecular details of these diseases. In this grant, we
propose to the budding yeast S. cerevisiae and mammalian cells including neurons to address
the role of mitochondria and cyclin C in the clearance of the aggregated disease proteins. Of
these proteins TDP-43, has emerged as a key player in AD, ALS, and FTLD. Studies in yeast
have revealed that cyclin C, a conserved member of the Cdk8 kinase module of the mediator
complex, plays a role in TDP-43 toxicity. Our studies point to cyclin C’s known interaction with

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Project Summary
Age of puberty is one the most reliable predictors of later mental health outcomes in girls, with early menarche
greatly increasing the risk of depression in early adulthood. Environmental exposure to endocrine disrupting
compounds (EDCs) has been linked with early puberty onset in girls. Despite this, the neurobiological
consequences of EDC exposure, and how they might predispose to depression, remain poorly understood. In a
series of preliminary studies, we showed that peripubertal exposure to a model EDC, bisphenol-A (BPA),
accelerates puberty onset in female rats, and predisposes to behaviors in early adulthood that are reminiscent
of anhedonia, a core symptom of clinical depression. These changes were associated with a persistent
impairment in the functioning of the orexin neuropeptide system, the activity of which is normally important for
translating motivational states into reward behaviors. Specifically, BPA was associated with reduced reactivity
of orexin neurons to reward-predictive stimuli, as well as reduced orexin terminals in ventral tegmental area
(VTA), a key region through which orexins initiate reward-directed actions. Based on these data, we hypothesize
that: at doses that promote early puberty onset, BPA produces a persistent impairment in the functioning of the
orexin-VTA circuit. We predict that these changes are causally linked to the anhedonia-like phenotype observed
in early adulthood in BPA-exposed rats. Here, we propose three distinct, yet interrelated aims to begin testing
our hypothesis. In Aim 1, we will characterize the baseline activity (using electrophysiology) of VTA-projecting
orexin neurons in BPA-exposed rats and determine how this is related to the expression of anhedonia-like
behavior in early adulthood. In Aim 2, we will use fiber photometry recordings of a novel orexin sensor to measure
orexin signaling in VTA in response to reward-predictive stimuli. Finally, in Aim 3, we will use chemogenetics to
stimulate the orexin-VTA circuit to test its causal role in the expression of anhedonia-like behavior following BPA.
These studies will be the first to determine the effect of EDC exposure on orexin neurons and their circuits, and
will determine their mechanistic involvement in depression outcomes in a model of early puberty onset. The
proposed project is thus highly relevant to the goal of NIEHS to understand the impact of environmental chemical
exposures on psychiatric illness. Moreover, these studies are a critical first step for developing novel strategies
to improve mental health outcomes in young women.

T cells play a central role in the anti-cancer immune response. Engineering and administrating tumor-specific T
cells have successfully treated some types of cancer. Compared to chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell
therapies, T cell receptor (TCR)-T cells engage tumor cells through engineered TCRs that bind peptides
presented by human leukocyte antigen (HLA). These peptides can be derived from tumor antigens in any
cellular compartment, making TCR-T an attractive approach to developing novel engineered T cell therapies.
Identifying suitable tumor-specific TCR is the most critical step for developing TCR-T therapies. However, only
a small number of TCRs that recognize shared tumor antigens have been identified, which is the major
bottleneck for developing novel TCR-T therapies. Here, we have identified two tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes
(TILs) from the sample patient that can be dramatically activated by three independent ccRCC cell lines,
indicating that these TILs contain T cells recognizing a shared tumor antigen. We further found that ccRCC-
TCR1 was dominant in these TILs and was shared by all activated T cells. This ccRCC-TCR1 is HLA-B0702
restricted, which is carried by ~26% of Americans. In vitro killing assays showed that these TILs are highly
cytotoxic to the ccRCC cell lines in an MHC-I-dependent manner. These data collectively suggested a high-
affinity TCR that potentially recognizes a widely shared ccRCC tumor antigen. We propose two aims to
develop TCR-T therapy with ccRCC-TCR1 to treat kidney cancer: 1) determine antigen specificity of ccRCC-
TCR1; 2) determine in vivo antitumor activity of ccRCC-TCR1 T cells. By identifying the antigen of ccRCC-
TCR1 and evaluating its antitumor activity in vivo, this translational project will pave the way for future clinical
applications. At the completion of the project, the expected outcomes are to have tumor-shared antigens
identified and move forward to conduct additional pre-clinical studies and prepare to initiate a clinical trial for
ccRCC-TCR1 T therapy.

The human body is composed of at least 400 different cell types, each distinguishable by distinct cellular markers.
Cancer cells also express distinct cellular markers, differentiating them from their precursor cell-type prior to
malignant transformation. Accordingly, the broad goal of oncology is targeted, tumor-specific therapies designed
to maximize therapeutic efficacy while avoiding undesired off-target effects. This is recognized as a major
obstacle for the application of current gene editing technologies. Proposed here is a strategy for tumor-specific
gene editing involving combined use of the chimeric adeno-associated virus / phage (AAVP) vector together with
the clustered regularly-interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) / CRISPR-associated protein (Cas) gene
editing system – collectively referred to as AAVP-CRISPR. The tissue-specific targeting aspect is carried out by
the phage capsid of AAVP, which can be modified to display a targeting peptide for ligand-directed delivery of a
desired transgene. AAVP, first introduced in 2006, is a well-characterized gene delivery tool that has been
explored in numerous tumor models. Here we plan to introduce two separate CRISPR/Cas systems with
previously demonstrated gene editing efficacy into the AAVP vector. The first construct will contain the
conventional CRISPR/Cas9 system, while the second construct will contain the more recently discovered
hypercompact CRISPR/CasΦ system, referred to as AAVP-CRISPR/Cas9 and AAVP-CRISPR/CasΦ,
respectively. The two constructs will be engineered to display RGD4C, a well-known, clinically viable tumor-
targeting peptide, and carry various gene editing guide RNA (gRNA) combinations. Gene editing using the two
constructs will first be performed in an in vitro setting, to confirm activity of the elements of each CRISPR/Cas
system, including receptor binding, cell internalization, Cas gene expression, and gene editing activity. Several
gRNA configurations will be tested in vitro and AAVP-CRISPR constructs containing the leading gRNA
candidates will be evaluated for tumor targeting, Cas expression, and gene editing activity in vivo. Successful
completion of the proposed studies will provide insight into the efficacy of AAVP-CRISPR for tumor-specific gene
editing and contribute to the development of much needed novel therapeutic strategies for cancer.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Project Summary
The lung is a major target of infections and allergies. Dendritic cells (DCs) in the lung function as sensors of
the immune system that detect and process pathogens and allergens to activate T cell-dependent adaptive
immunity. In addition, pathogens and allergens often stimulate airway sensory neurons either directly or
indirectly, leading to primary defense response such as coughing and sneezing. Recent studies highlighted
the role of neurons in immune responses, but the interaction between these two sensor modules, DCs and
sensory neurons, in inflammation in the lung is incompletely understood.
Infection with helminth parasites is a major health burden worldwide. Some helminth species such as
roundworms and hookworms in humans and Nippostrongylus brasiliensis (Nb), a commonly used model agent
to study hookworm infection in mice, traffic to the lung during their life cycle and cause potent type 2
inflammation. The larvae of these parasites stay in the lung only transiently before they get coughed up and
swallowed to migrate to the intestine, where they eventually mature and lay eggs. Thus, the cough-triggering
sensory neurons seem to play an important role in their life cycle, but their role in the regulation of inflammation
remains unclear.
We previously identified CD301b/Mgl2 as a marker for the migratory type 2 conventional DCs in peripheral
organs including the lung, and showed that CD301b+ DCs are required for the differentiation of Th2 cells. We
recently found that CD301b+ DCs are required for Nb-induced lung inflammation as well as for timely clearance
of the parasite. Interestingly, our data also suggest that CD301b+ DCs and sensory neurons suppress each
other to regulate lung inflammation during Nb infection.
Based on these data, we hypothesize that Nb parasites are sensed by CD301b+ DCs and sensory neurons,
which then mutually regulate each other to orchestrate type 2 inflammation in the lung. By using Nb infection
as a model, the long-term goal of this project is to understand how sensory neurons modulate type 2
inflammation in the lung. Since the lung is a major site not only for helminth infection but also for other type 2
inflammation disorders such as allergy, asthma and fibrosis, understanding the mechanism for the regulation of
type 2 inflammation is of clinical relevance.

The high mortality and morbidity of tuberculosis (TB), an infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium
tuberculosis (Mtb), calls for development of novel adjunct host-directed therapies (HDTs) to improve treatment
outcome and restrict the emergence of multi-drug-resistant Mtb strains. Knowledge of immunometabolism offers
new opportunities for controlling this deadly disease. We and others have characterized immunometabolic
changes in multiple animal models of TB and found that metabolic remodeling to the HIF-1-mediated Warburg
effect is a general response of host immune cells to Mtb infection. Through detailed analysis of immunometabolic
dynamics of the macrophage response to Mtb infection, we discovered that M1-like polarization at initial stages
of infection is accompanied by upregulation of ARG2, a type II arginase located in mitochondria. Given the critical
roles that mitochondria play in mediating the signaling and metabolic pathways during macrophage activation,
the upregulation of mitochondrial ARG2 suggests a little-studied role of this enzyme in M1-like polarization.
Indeed, macrophages from Arg2 KO mice showed a diminished proinflammatory response and dysregulated
mitochondrial dynamics. The identification of arginine metabolism-associated pathways, as well as upregulation
of a related set of genes that include Arg2, using metabolomics and transcriptomics studies of Mtb-infected
mouse lungs, also indicate that ARG2-mediated arginine and/or ornithine metabolism is an important regulator
of host immunity to control Mtb infection in vivo. Based on these observations, we hypothesize that mitochondrial
ARG2 activity contributes to M1-like polarization by regulating mitochondria dynamics and functions, including
generation of signaling molecules, activation of signaling networks, and changes in mitochondrial metabolism to
meet the biosynthetic and bioenergetic demands of activating macrophages. We will test the hypothesis 1) by
delineating ex vivo effects of ARG2-mediated arginine metabolism on mitochondrial biology and macrophage
polarization, using multiple approaches/assays that include stable isotope tracing metabolomics; and 2) by
characterizing the role of ARG2-mediated arginine/ornithine metabolism in regulating the expression of innate
and adaptive immunity during Mtb infection in vivo. We will also test an adjunct HDT through arginine or ornithine
supplementation to improve infection outcome. We expect to aid the development of urgently needed adjunct
HDTs with dietary supplementation of arginine/ornithine that should help clear the pathogen at an early stage of
infection, prevent reactivation from a latent infection, and/or shorten the duration of antibiotic therapy.

Breast cancer affects many women in their lifetime. A major challenge remains how to reduce breast cancer risk
as well as to understand what causes breast cancer. Two-thirds of breast cancer diagnosed in patients belong
to estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer. Many chemicals, with similar structure to estrogen, have been
suggested to mimic the biological functions of estrogen, potentially contributing to the initiation or progression of
breast cancer. Environmental estrogenic endocrine disruptor contaminants, such as bisphenols, phthalates and
zeranols, have been known to have estrogenic activity in cell culture and animal models. However, the impact
of endocrine disruptors on breast cancer development in humans remains unclear. We hypothesize that
endocrine disruptors, by increasing breast cancer stem cells and altering tumor metabolism, promote the
development of breast cancer. The objectives of this project are to determine impact of endocrine disruptors in
breast cancer development and to understand mechanisms of endocrine disruptors in alteration of cancer stem
cells and metabolome leading to accelerating ER-positive breast cancer. We propose two Specific Aims as
follows. In Aim 1, using the estrogen sensitive ACI strain, we will investigate the impact of endocrine disruptors
on the mammary gland proliferation in vivo. We will test three representative classes of common environmental
endocrine disruptors, bisphenols, phthalates and zeranols for this Aim. In Aim 2, we will determine endocrine
disruptors-induced alteration of breast cancer stem cells and cell metabolism in the ER-positive breast cancer
model. MCF-7 mammosphere culture and MCF-7 xenografted tumor models will be utilized to investigate the
role of endocrine disruptors in enhancing cancer stem cells and altering tumor metabolism in vitro and in vivo.
We will test three representative classes of endocrine disruptors, bisphenols, phthalates and zeranols in vitro.
Selected endocrine disruptors will be further evaluated for in vivo tumor studies. Endocrine disruptors have long
been suggested for its potential role in promoting cancer development and progression. This project seeks to
understand the mechanism of endocrine disruptors in the mammary tumorigenesis by focusing on cancer stem
cells and metabolism shift. Environmental factors and lifestyle have led to significant changes in breast cancer
risks. Our study with endocrine disruptors could provide the valuable link between environmental exposures and
human health.

All individuals with type 1 and >30% of those with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T1/2DM) require intensive insulin
therapy to manage their blood glucose levels. This therapy comes at a great price: increased incidence of
iatrogenic insulin-induced hypoglycemia. Insulin-induced hypoglycemia is not only acutely life-threatening,
repeated hypoglycemia (RH) impairs the ability of the brain to detect and correct subsequent hypoglycemia
allowing glucose levels to fall to dangerous, even lethal, levels. Declining glucose first triggers the hormonal
(e.g., glucagon, epinephrine) counterregulatory response (CRR) to stimulate gluconeogenesis. Further glucose
decline leads to the behavioral response known as hypoglycemia awareness which includes neurogenic (e.g.,
palpitations, anxiety) and neuroglycopenic (e.g., tiredness, confusion) symptoms that alert the individual of
hypoglycemia. RH impairs these hormonal and behavioral responses leading to hypoglycemia associated
autonomic failure (HAAF) and hypoglycemia unawareness, respectively. While the CRR and HAAF have been
studied extensively, little is known about the mechanisms underlying hypoglycemia awareness/unawareness.
This oversight was due to lack of an animal model. However, the Levin lab recently developed a rat model for
hypoglycemia awareness which we have translated into the mouse. This model enables us for the first time to
investigate how RH causes hypoglycemia unawareness. Our data suggest that orexin expressing neurons in the
perifornical hypothalamus (PFH) which are inhibited by glucose (glucose inhibited or GI) play a role in
hypoglycemia awareness. We find that RH blunts activation of PFH orexin-GI neuron in low glucose. Using our
mouse model of hypoglycemia awareness/unawareness we have shown that the dopamine reuptake inhibitor
modafinil restores hypoglycemia awareness after RH. Modafinil also restores glucose sensing by PFH orexin-GI
neurons. In this proposal we will test the hypothesis that RH increases the inhibitory effect of glucose on
PFH orexin-GI neurons leading to hypoglycemia unawareness. Modafinil, via the dopamine 1 receptor,
restores both glucose sensitivity of PFH orexin-GI neurons and hypoglycemia awareness. We will
determine how RH alters the glucose sensitivity of PFH orexin-GI neurons and how this is corrected by modafinil.
We will also determine the role of dopamine receptors in modafinil’s effect. Finally, we will determine the role of
diabetic hyperglycemia per se in hypoglycemia awareness/unawareness. These studies are the first to shed light
on the mechanisms of hypoglycemia awareness/unawareness and as such are of critical importance for patients
with T1/2DM.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the deadliest malignancies. Full transcriptome defines
clinically relevant “subtypes” of disease and the basal-like subtype of PDAC is associated with advanced
stage, metastasis, resistance to treatment, and poor patient survival. The mechanism by which the tumor
microenvironment drives PDAC subtype differentiation remains uncharacterized. Understanding the cancer-
extrinsic factors in the tumor microenvironment that promotes the basal-like state could uncover cancer
vulnerabilities and lead to the development of new therapeutic approaches. We found that inactivation of the
histone demethylase gene Kdm8 reprograms PDAC cells into a highly metastatic state. Morphologically, Kdm8
inactivation reduces the expression of genes defining the classical PDAC subtype and drives a profound loss
of differentiation in a genetically engineered PDAC mouse model. Importantly, the enzymatic function of Kdm8
requires molecular oxygen and hypoxia diminished the phenotypic changes induced by Kdm8 inactivation. We
noted a global upregulation of histone 3 lysine 27 (H3K27) trimethylation upon the inactivation of Kdm8,
supporting the involvement of its demethylase function in regulating the chromatin and cell state. In human
PDAC, KDM8-regulated gene signatures are an exceptionally good predictor of the disease subtype. Our
preliminary results suggest that hypoxia within the tumor microenvironment restricts the demethylase function
of Kdm8, thereby suppressing the classical PDAC subtype while promoting a basal-like state and metastasis
through epigenetic reprogramming. We hypothesize that a hypoxia-KDM8-chromatin axis plays a critical role in
PDAC subtype determination and metastatic ability.
In the proposed study, we aim to determine the mechanism by which Kdm8 controls PDAC subtypes and
metastatic progression and the mechanism by which hypoxia suppresses Kdm8 function to promote chromatin
reprogramming and PDAC metastasis. Overall, our study will fill the major gap in our understanding of how
hypoxia within the PDAC tumor microenvironment promotes the basal-like molecular subtype and metastasis.
Our mechanistic study will uncover fundamental insights into the role of KDM8 in subtype determination and
may discover novel vulnerabilities of the basal-like PDAC state. The long-term objective is to gain a better
understanding of the key cell-extrinsic factors in the tumor microenvironment that promote the aggressive or
basal-like PDAC subtypes.

T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is an aggressive hematologic malignancy that occurs
primarily in children but can also occur in adults. Despite recent advances in treatments, 20-50% of
patients do show primary resistance or relapse after treatment and ultimately die from their disease,
highlighting the need to discover novel targeted therapeutic approaches. The detection of highly
prevalent NOTCH1 activating mutations in T-ALL, seen in ~60% of patients, led to the discovery of
NOTCH1 signaling inhibitors such as gamma-secretase inhibitors (GSIs), that block a critical
proteolytical cleavage step required for NOTCH1 maturation and activation. GSIs are currently being
explored in clinical trials for relapsed/refractory cases, however, the responses observed as a single
agent treatment have been generally limited, such that the identification of novel targets and
combination therapies capable of delivering strong and synergistic antileukemic responses in patients
is one of the most urgent goals in the T-ALL field. Our lab has previously demonstrated the therapeutic
benefit of targeting metabolic routes in T-ALL. In this context, my preliminary results strongly
suggest that targeting the glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase (PKM) has strong antileukemic
effects on its own, and significantly synergizes with GSI treatment in vivo. Still, the role of PKM in T-
ALL remains largely unknown. Notably, PKM has two different isoforms, PKM1 and PKM2, and we
have already generated conditional knockout leukemias for each specific isoform, as well as for both
of them concomitantly, which will allow us to exquisitely analyze the effects of pyruvate kinase in
leukemia progression and response to therapy in vivo. Thus, the aim of this project is to
mechanistically dissect the function of PKM in T-ALL by using a combination of gene expression,
metabolomic profiling, epigenetic profiling and experimental therapeutics in vivo, taking advantage of
our unique genetic tools. Our results will shed light on the mechanisms by which NOTCH1 controls
cancer cell metabolism and will reveal PKM as a putative novel target for the treatment of T-ALL.

 Rapid and sensitive point of care tests that can detect all forms of drug resistance are urgently needed to
enable appropriate treatment for TB. Molecular drug susceptibility tests (mDSTs) which use nucleic acid
amplification techniques to detect mutations associated with resistance to the primary tuberculosis (TB) drugs
isoniazid (INH), and rifampin (RIF), and in a few rare cases fluoroquinolones (FQs) have demonstrated the
potential of this susceptibility testing approach. However, current mDSTs are unable to detect the large numbers
of mutations which encode for resistance to the critical new anti-tubercular drug, bedaquiline (BDQ), and linezolid
(LZD). These new drugs along with FQs and another new drug Pretominid (Pa) comprise the backbone of the
most promising TB treatments of the future. Yet, without the availability of companion mDSTs, the world risks
losing these new drugs to drug resistance within a few years of deployment. We propose to use innovative new
fluidic and assay designs to enable detection of hundreds of different mutations encoding FQ, LZD, and BDQ
resistance using the standard Cepheid assay cartridge. This new test would retain all the advantages of current
Cepheid TB assays, a robust manufacturing and instrument placement base enabled by the high volume of
assays currently produced. This research program will include 4 aims. Aim 1. Develop mis-match tolerant or
“sloppy” molecular beacons (SMBs) that identify mutations associated with FQ and LZD resistance that are
optimized for ultimate use in the new three-phase highly multiplex system to be developed in this grant. Aim 2.
BDQ assay development detecting mutations in atpE and a new SMB tiling approach that queries the entire Mtb
Rv0678 gene to identify mutations causal of BDQ resistance. Aim 3 Optimize three-phase cartridge fluidics for
highly multiplex mutation detection. Aim 4. Perform an initial laboratory and clinical validation study of the final
aim 1-3 assays using stored clinical samples.

 Rapid and sensitive point of care tests that can detect all forms of drug resistance in tuberculosis (TB) are
urgently needed to address the rise of drug resistance. We propose to develop a novel mutation detection system
that uses recently developed nanoreactor bead chemistry and the Blink Diagnostic’s testing platform to identify
both the presence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) and all of the clinically important mutations associated
with isoniazid (INH), rifampin (RIF), ethambutol (EMB), pyrazinamide (PZA), fluoroquinolone (FQ), linezolid (L),
bedaquiline (B), and pretomanid/delamanid (Pa/De) resistance. The new system will include integrated sample
processing and rapid thermal cycling technologies to produce results within 30 minutes at the point of care.
Mutations will be detected using digital and real-time PCR in novel addressable nanoreactor beads followed by
melting temperature analysis enabling robust detection of hundreds of different resistance mutations with the
sensitivity of current molecular diagnostics and the quantitation and hetero-resistance detection capacity of
digital PCR. This proposal will build upon an established partnership between Blink scientists and engineers who
previously developed highly successfully instruments and assays at Alere (currently Abbott Rapid Diagnostics),
and the academic team responsible for the suite of Xpert TB assays previously developed in collaboration with
Cepheid to perform the following specific aims: 1. Develop mis-match tolerant or “sloppy” molecular beacons
(SMBs) that identify mutations associated with INH, RIF, EMB and FQ resistance that are optimized to nanobead
format and fully functional on the Blink platform. 2. Finalize a SMB assay that queries the entire Mtb pncA gene
to identify mutations causal of PZA resistance specifically adapted for nanobead format in the BLINK system. 3.
Finalize development of cartridge based mechanical nucleic acid extraction process from sputum and other
matrixes for Mtb. 4. Expand the nanobead assay to test for all clinically relevant mutations causing with
resistance to Pa, B and L using the principals and chemistries developed in aims 1 – 2. 5. Perform initial
laboratory and clinical validation studies of the final aim 1-4 assays using stored clinical samples.

 Non-polio enteroviruses (NPEVs) are etiological agents for several human diseases including respiratory
infections, hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD), aseptic meningitis, encephalitis, neonatal sepsis,
myocarditis, conjunctivitis, and acute flaccid paralysis. Among the more than 100 serotypes of NPEVs, some of
the most significant pathogens are enterovirus D68 (EV-D68), enterovirus A71 (EV-A71) and coxsackievirus B3
(CV-B3). According to CDC, these NPEVs combined have caused 10 to 15 million infections and tens of
thousands of hospitalizations in the U.S. Clearly, NPEVs are a public concern for both U.S. and the world.
 No vaccines are available in the U.S. for the NPEVs such as EV-D68, EV-A71, and CV-B3. Three
inactivated EV-A71 vaccines are available in China. However, there are not broadly protective, and the efficacy
is limited to certain strains. There is no FDA-approved antiviral for any of these NPEVs. Thus, there is a
pressing need to develop orally bioavailable pan-enterovirus antivirals.
 This proposal focuses on targeting the enterovirus nonstructural 2C protein for the development of orally
bioavailable broad-spectrum NPEV antivirals. Specifically, in Aim 1, we will optimize the antiviral activity and
pharmacokinetic properties of three series of 2C inhibitors. In Aim 2, we will determine the high-resolution X-
ray crystal structures of EV-A71, EV-D68, and CV-B3 2C proteins with structurally disparate 2C inhibitors. In
Aim 3, we will evaluate the in vivo antiviral efficacy of 2C inhibitors in EV-D68 and EV-A71 infection mouse
models. Successful implementation of this proposal will provide orally bioavailable broad-spectrum NPEV drug
candidates for further development.

Early detection of tuberculosis (TB) disease to prevent transmission and disability is hampered
by the lack of precise biomarkers to diagnose and predict TB progression. The objective of this
study is to develop computational imaging tools to characterize and diagnose individuals
without TB symptoms who will progress to sputum culture-positive or symptomatic TB disease.
In Aim 1, we will combine computed tomography (CT) scans from existing and prospective TB
household contact studies to derive a high-resolution radiomic signature to predict and
characterize early disease pathology. In Aim 2, we will evaluate methods to enhance
performance of field-deployable chest-X-ray computer aided detection (CAD) systems to
diagnose early TB using transfer learning, image-to-image training, and integration of clinical
and epidemiologic variables. Our goal is to develop a fundamental toolbox for research,
diagnosis, and targeted preventive treatment of early TB to prevent transmission and
accelerate TB control.

Prostate cancer (CaP) is the leading non-cutaneous cancer in men, accounting for roughly 1 in 5 new cases and
1 in 10 deaths from cancer per year. Few modifiable risk factors have been identified for CaP, limiting
opportunities for primary prevention. In the US, Black men experience over twice the rate of mortality from CaP
compared to White men, disparities that are partly explained by differences in neighborhood environmental
context. Black men are often exposed to higher burden of environmental pollutants due to segregation and
neighborhood disinvestment, which may contribute to disparities. Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS)
are synthetic industrial chemicals of public health concern due to their ubiquitous presence and persistence in
the body and environment, as well as growing evidence of their adverse health impacts. Certain PFAS have
been classified as Group 2B (“possible”) carcinogens by the Institute of Agency for Cancer. Some studies in
populations with high occupational or community exposures to PFAS have shown elevated risk of CaP, but few
studies have examined these associations in large racially-diverse, population-based studies. I propose to study
three commonly measured PFAS (PFOA, perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), and perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA)
as potential risk factors for aggressive CaP and CaP disparities in New Jersey. I will develop a spatiotemporal
model of drinking water PFAS exposure using multiple geographic datasets capturing business, hydrology,
meteorologic, and census variables. Modeled PFAS exposure will be linked to masked residential address
histories collected from men diagnosed with CaP in the New Jersey State Cancer Registry to estimate the risk
of advanced CaP associated with increasing levels of PFAS. I will then conduct a pilot study among patients
seeking CaP treatment at the Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey. I will evaluate differences in PFAS souces
by different sociodemographic groups, and study associations between serum PFAS and risk of biochemical
reccurrence among men treated for CaP. This research will be complemented by a training program to develop
knowledge and skills in health effects of endocrine-disrupting chemicals, spatiotemporal modeling of
environmental chemicals, primary data collection and biospecimen collection, and molecular alterations involved
in prostate carcinogenesis. I have invited a multidisciplinary team of environmental and cancer researchers to
support my training. My short-term goals are to develop expertise in pathways through which PFAS and related
endocrine-disrupting chemicals influence CaP, and disseminate findings through conference presentations and
publications. My long-term goal is to become an independent scientist and expert in multilevel environmental
and biological pathways that influence CaP progression and outcomes. Preliminary data generated through this
project will support the development of an R01 proposal to clarify mechanisms through which PFAS and other
endocrine-disrupting chemicals influence tumor biology and risk of recurrence following treatment for CaP.

The purpose of this research is to assess the use and effects of a new generation of misleading descriptors
and imagery in combustible tobacco marketing. While regulatory efforts to date have made strides in restricting
the use of especially misleading terms in tobacco marketing (e.g., “mild”, “natural”), industry marketing has
evolved to utilize newer descriptors and imagery that are known to be associated with these restricted terms;
yet, research studying this evolution is quite limited. As the tobacco industry continues to mislead consumers
with attempts to skirt regulatory actions via implied reduced risk claims (e.g., “organic”, “tobacco and water”), it
is crucial to track their misleading marketing tactics and monitor effects on vulnerable youth and young adults
(YYAs), especially as this suggestive marketing for traditional tobacco products now exists alongside other
products actually authorized for designation as modified risk (i.e., Modified Risk Tobacco Products, or MRTPs).
Through a preliminary literature and marketing content review under Aim 1, this research will characterize
newer descriptors and imagery utilized in misleading marketing for combustible tobacco products (because
these products pose the greatest harms), focusing specifically on cigarettes and cigarillos. Aim 1 focus groups
with YYAs will assess attention, product appeal, and risk perceptions for products advertised/packaged with
these descriptors and imagery, as well as other products by the same brands and MRTPs. Results will inform a
discrete choice experiment (DCE) (Aim 2) that manipulates a series of target descriptors and images as well as
modified risk claims on cigarette and cigarillo packs, in order to isolate independent and joint effects of the
target features on product appeal and preferences. Under Aim 3, an eye-tracking study will examine young
people’s attention to ads and packs using salient descriptors and images (per focus group and DCE results),
and in combination with the prior activities, will provide preliminary data to inform research avenues for future
regulatory efforts. This K01 will support the pursuit of my long-term career goal of becoming an independent
tobacco control researcher at the intersection of tobacco policy, health communication, and tobacco misbeliefs;
it will develop my content expertise (i.e., trends in/effects of cigarette and cigarillo marketing) and cultivate new
methodological skillsets (i.e., focus groups, DCE, eye-tracking). The proposed research will allow me to work
towards research independence and an R01 grant to further study misleading tobacco marketing, with a new
focus on additional products and an emphasis on regulatory remedy.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
 Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are biologically and environmentally persistent anthropogenic
chemicals. Over 98% of the U.S. population has detectable levels of PFAS in their blood (serum). People may
be exposed to PFAS through contaminated drinking water and food, house dust, or consumer products. Some
populations may experience additional PFAS exposures from their jobs or hobbies. PFAS are of public health
concern because of their associations with numerous adverse health outcomes including dyslipidemia, an
imbalance of blood lipids such as high cholesterol. Dyslipidemia is a primary risk factor for ischemic heart disease
(IHD), the leading cause of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the U.S. and globally.
 Volunteer firefighters are community members who fill a critical public safety function, particularly in suburban
and rural areas. Firefighters can be exposed to PFAS through combustion products, firefighting foams, and
firefighter protective clothing. The association between PFAS exposure and dyslipidemia is of major concern in
this population because cardiac events are the primary cause of line-of-duty deaths among all firefighters.
However, the extent and pathways of volunteer firefighters’ PFAS exposures, and the ways these exposures
may affect their blood lipid levels, are unknown. While 65% of the over 1 million U.S. firefighters are volunteers,
they are understudied, creating critical knowledge gaps in evidence-based efforts to protect and improve the
health of volunteer firefighters and the communities they serve.
 To address these gaps, we will leverage existing data from the Rutgers Firefighter Cancer Assessment and
Prevention Study (CAPS), a cohort of volunteer firefighters from 8 U.S. states. This F31 fellowship builds upon
the applicant’s preliminary work with CAPS data using pilot funding. Two specific aims will be used to achieve
the objectives of identifying (a) predictors of serum PFAS concentrations including sociodemographic,
firefighting, and occupational characteristics, and (b) associations between PFAS and lipid concentrations in
volunteer firefighters. Aim 1: Assess the seroprevalence, predictors, and possible exposure sources of
PFAS among U.S. volunteer firefighters. We hypothesize that heterogeneous distributions and concentrations
of serum PFAS will be associated primarily with community-related exposure sources. Aim 2: Examine
associations between serum PFAS and dyslipidemia among U.S. volunteer firefighters. We hypothesize
that serum PFOA and PFOS (the most frequently detected and studied PFAS) will be positively associated with
total cholesterol and LDL. We will also assess associations between less commonly studied PFAS and seven
lipid measures. We will use single-pollutant and mixture models to characterize the effects of multiple
simultaneous PFAS exposures. This work will advance our understanding of the health impacts of this
environmental exposure in a critical population of community-based first responders.

Tuberculosis (TB) is a global health crisis. As the second leading cause of death due to infectious disease, it
claims roughly 1.5 million lives a year. Although TB can be treated, the curative regimen is complicated and
takes several months. Drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), including totally drug-resistant strains,
is steadily increasing in prevalence. Therefore, novel therapeutics with the potential to decrease treatment
duration and increase barriers to resistance are essential for disease eradication. Most TB drug discovery
programs have taken target-based approaches and largely ignored intrabacterial metabolism. However, several
first- and second- line antituberculars penetrate Mtb as prodrugs and are intrabacterially metabolized into their
active form. When faced with the markedly lipid-rich, hydrophobic environment of the Mtb cell envelope, prodrugs
have the ability to enter the cell and subsequently release more polar, Mtb-active moieties within the bacterium.
Most Mtb prodrugs are activated by non-essential enzymes, and, as a consequence, resistance develops
quickly. For example, pyrazinamide (PZA), a key first-line antitubercular that enables a shortened TB drug
regimen, is activated to pyrazinoic acid (POA) by the non-essential amidase PncA, and the vast majority of PZA
resistance is caused by mutations in this activating gene. Notably, several other Mtb amidases have also been
shown to metabolize amide antituberculars, thereby activating prodrugs and inactivating active drug compounds.
We hypothesize that we can harness Mtb amidases to design and activate amide prodrugs within Mtb that are
active in drug-resistant disease and that have increased barriers to resistance. Our proposal aims to 1) study
the amide-amidase interactions to identify amide prodrugs that are activated by more than one amidase and 2)
link POA to amine metabolites from parent compounds that demonstrate amide hydrolysis within Mtb to generate
potential POA-releasing conjugates that are activated by non-PncA amidases. The majority of amidases are
non-essential and likely have overlapping functions, enabling the discovery of amide-containing antituberculars
that are activated by multiple amidases. Furthermore, the release of POA by amidases other than PncA would
retain PZA-like activity in PZA-resistant strains, restoring the activity of a first-line antitubercular critical for shorter
TB regimens. This approach will introduce a novel framework for TB prodrug discovery that can be applied to
other classes of small molecules and their activating enzymes. In all, the proposed project and training plan will
greatly further my development as a researcher and independent scientific thinker by introducing me to new
scientific concepts and techniques and providing ample opportunity for me the integrate my research and clinical
experiences. Together, Rutgers New Jersey Medical School, the Public Health Research Institute, and the
Global TB Institute create a highly collaborative and highly translational environment that uniquely benefit my
training as an infectious disease physician-scientist.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Invasion is one of the most detrimental features of all cancers, including breast cancer, as it allows cells to
escape the primary site and form metastases at distant organs. Despite progress in prevention and early
lesions detection, the mortality associated with metastatic breast cancer is still extremely high. This is
especially true for patients presenting with triple negative breast cancer (TNBC, characterized by lack of
expression of ER, PR, and Her2 ), which is the most aggressive and deadliest subtype of breast cancer and
the one that so far lack specific targets for therapeutic intervention. Understanding the mechanisms that
facilitate the invasion of tumor cells will enable us to design more efficient therapeutic strategies to prevent or
reduce metastasis.
Our group has established a fundamental connection between GTP metabolism and tumor cell invasiveness;
we have unveiled GTP and its metabolic enzymes (GME) as key players in tumor progression and metastatic
potential. We have developed unique fluorescent reporters for intracellular GTP that have allowed us to
determine that, in live cells, the intracellular GTP distribution is not uniform, and brought forward the hypothesis
that local concentration of GTP can influence GTP-dependent processes. In particular, we have previously
shown that genetic or pharmacological modulation of the GTP metabolic pathway deeply affected the
activation status of small GTPases of the RHO-family and, with it, the tumor cells' invasive capability. Thus, in
Aim 1 we will explore a novel mechanism of G-proteins activation based on GME subcellular localization.
Our preliminary results showed that the rate-limiting enzyme for GTP de novo production, inositol
monophosphate dehydrogenase 2 (IMPDH2) enriches at cell membrane sites that are critical for cell migration
and invasion (namely focal adhesion, FA, and invadopodia). The role of IMPDH2 at these sites is virtually
uncharacterized. Thus, in Aim 2 we will assess the catalytic and structural role of IMPDH2 in FA and
invadopodia formation, as well as in focal adhesion kinase (FAK)-directed oncogenic motility.
The understanding of GTP metabolic enzymes transcriptional regulation is far from complete. Identification of
transcriptional master regulators of the GTP biosynthetic pathway that could be pharmacologically targeted
would offer a more efficient way of suppressing this pathway. Our preliminary results suggest that Kruppel-like
factor 9 (KLF9) and aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) play antagonistic roles in the transcriptional regulation of
GTP metabolic enzymes, with KLF9 suppressing, whereas AHR inducing GTP production. Thus, in Aim 3 we
will elucidate this regulation and explore pharmacological treatments to regulate the activity of these
transcription factors.

Major depressive disorder and other mood disorders are heterogeneous, debilitating illnesses that affect millions
of individuals worldwide. Antidepressants that target the serotonergic system (e.g., SSRIs) remain the most
effective treatment for these disorders and are widely used. However, emerging data show that maternal
antidepressant treatment affects the long-term health and neurodevelopment of offspring through, as yet poorly
understood epigenetic mechanisms. Recent pioneering discoveries from my lab have allowed us to develop the
model organism C. elegans to dissect the molecular mechanisms by which maternal stress, through the
serotonergic system, impacts chromatin in the pre-fertilized oocyte. Notwithstanding the differences between
the C. elegans and mammalian serotonergic systems (5-HT source being neurons, enterochromaffin cells and
maternal placenta in mammals and only neurons in C. elegans), an acute elevation of serotonin levels is a stress
signal in both mammals and C. elegans and acts through conserved receptor-mediated signal transduction
pathways to induce the ancient, conserved transcription factor, HSF1. Our working hypothesis, premised on
preliminary data, is that the stress-induced release of serotonin from maternal neurons in C. elegans enables
HSF1 to recruit chromatin remodeling proteins in a piRNA (21U-RNA)-dependent manner in the germline and
modify chromatin in pre-fertilized oocytes. The result is that threat perception by the mother alters the
development, behavior and physiology of future offspring. In Aim 1, we will identify the neural bases and
signaling mechanisms of the serotonergic defense survival circuit in the parent. In Aim 2, we will identify the
epigenetic changes in pre-fertilized germ cells caused by maternal serotonin, and understand how they impact
offspring neurodevelopment, behavior, and stress resilience.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Project Summary
Fibrotic liver disease is a growing public health concern significantly impacting the global population. Fibrotic
liver disease is often the result of sustained insults; chronic viral hepatitis B and C as well as NAFLD are the
most prevalent causes. While antiviral regimens for hepatitis B and C have decreased the viral cirrhosis burden,
other causes like NAFLD are increasingly prevalent, now affecting 14-27% of individuals in developed countries.
 Despite this high disease burden, there are currently no approved therapies. Rather, the lack of consensus
on optimal drug targets or strategies reflects a gap in our mechanistic understanding of disease drivers. Similarly,
the utility and clinical relevance of animal models is equally controversial. A multitude of models are currently
used, but each recapitulates only isolated aspects of human pathophysiology. There is an unmet need for
human-relevant systems that recapitulate key elements of fibrotic liver disease to enable mechanistic dissection.
 The measurable improvement in liver fibrosis in some but not all patients following successful antiviral
treatment reinforces the need for better understanding of fibrogenesis at a molecular level to aid development of
new treatments to prevent fibrosis or encourage regression. For NAFLD, despite identification of increasing
numbers of susceptibility-associated genetic variants and lifestyle-dependent risk factors, the mechanisms by
which they individually or synergistically contribute to disease progression remain largely unclear.
 The primary research goal of this proposal is to exploit a unique renewable and genetically manipulatable
human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived multicellular culture system to address the aforementioned gaps. In
this multicellular system, we coculture hPSC-derived hepatocytes, hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), and
macrophages in a manner that recapitulates the complexity of liver physiology in both health and disease.
Modeling hepatitis virus infection and NAFLD in the multicellular cultures, we found that both HCV infection and
a lipotoxic milieu induced inflammatory signals and stellate cell activation. A lipotoxic milieu also triggered other
features of NAFLD clinical phenotypes. Eliminating HCV reversed fibrosis-like phenotypes and treating with
obeticholic acid showed improvement in NAFLD-like features, as observed in the clinic.
 Across three aims, using cell and molecular approaches, we capitalize on the unique features of this novel
platform to address questions that cannot be adequately answered with any existing ex vivo human-relevant
system, including the roles of cytokines in HSC activation (Aim 1), the mechanisms of reversion after activation
(Aim 2) and the role of genetics and lifestyle-associated risk factors in NAFLD (Aim 3). Understanding the
molecular mechanisms of stellate cell activation and fibrosis development are critical for developing diagnostics
and designing new treatments to block fibrosis or promote regression. In addition, elucidating the mechanisms
of how genetic variants and risk factors contribute to liver disease progression may offer the opportunity to craft
targeted antifibrotic interventions optimized for particular patient subgroups.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Project Summary
The highly specialized intestinal immune system is charged with maintaining tolerance to harmless stimuli from
commensal bacteria and food, while providing protective immunity against pathogens. Dysregulation of this
critical balance can lead to inflammatory bowel disease, food allergy, or increased susceptibility to enteric
pathogens. CD4+ T cells are key players in intestinal homeostasis, finely tuning responses at the level of antigen
recognition and functional differentiation. In the intestinal epithelium (IE) and underlying lamina propria (LP),
tissue adapted pro-inflammatory (ie. Th17, Th1) and regulatory (Treg) and intraepithelial (CD8aa+ CD4IEL) CD4+
T cells coordinate immunity and tolerance to diverse intestinal stimuli. Nevertheless, it remains to be defined
how TCR repertoire and its specificity translate to function of both LP and IELs in response to microbial antigens.
Additionally, very little is known about the characteristics of dietary antigen-specific intestinal T cells. Oral
tolerance, a critical mechanism of gut homeostasis whereby oral administration of antigen results in both local
and systemic tolerance to that antigen, is known to depend on Tregs. However, the clonal dynamics of polyclonal
T cell responses in the setting of tolerance remain unclear. Finally, outside the context of immunization or allergy,
T cells that specifically recognize food protein have yet to be identified. Based on data recently published as well
as preliminary data obtained during the current funding cycle, we hypothesize that tissue cues combined with
TCR-driven signals from commensal microbes and food dictate intestinal T cell functional differentiation in steady
state, while disruption of normal T cell responses by infections or allergens results in inappropriate clonal
dynamics including expansion of pathological T cells. Aim 1 will define how stimulation by microbiota or enteric
viruses impact TCR repertoire and functional differentiation of intestinal CD4 T cells. Aim 2 will characterize the
role of dietary antigens in the context of tolerance, enteric infections, or food allergy, affect TCR repertoire and
functional differentiation of intestinal CD4 T cells. We combine single cell transcriptomics with a novel fate-
mapping strategy to selectively label peripheral T cells that are recruited to the intestine under various microbial
and dietary challenges. A recently developed LIPSTIC tool that allows intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) labeling
of interacting cells will be utilized to define potential mechanisms of IEL recruitment/expansion in response to
nonself stimuli. Recently generated murine strains with fixed TCR Vb chain, or that carry microbiota-specific
TCRs, combined with complementary tetramer and gnotobiotic strategies will be used to specifically track and
define recognition properties during T cell migration and differentiation in the gut. Novel “super-tetramer” and
dietary manipulations, combined with inflammatory challenges will be used to define food antigen-specific T cells
during steady state and how intestinal CD4+ T cell responses to dietary antigen are altered in a food allergic or
infection context. By combining these innovative approaches and concepts in mucosal immunology, this proposal
will help better defining the role of nonself antigen stimulation in T cell repertoire and function in the intestine.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：5-methylcytosine (m5C) is an important RNA modification studied mostly for its role in tRNA biology. However, its roles in other aspects of RNA biology remain understudied. Our preliminary results, using bisulfite treatment of RNA followed by high-throughput sequencing, show that the genomes of many RNA viruses are m5C methylated in a site-specific manner, including Sindbis virus (SINV), chikungunya virus (CHIKV) and Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3). The presence of m5C in diverse viruses, whose RNAs undergo many processes including translation, replication, transcription, and virion packaging, provides an attractive starting point for understanding the broader significance of this modification in regulating RNA function. A single dominant m5C site in SINV allowed us to generate an m5C-null mutant that exhibited cell-type dependent effects on virus replication. The host tRNA methyltransferase (MTase), NSUN2, which is important for host neuronal development and stem cell differentiation, appears to be the “writer” required for m5C modification of SINV. NSUN5, an MTase of ribosomal RNA is required for CVB3 methylation. We hypothesize that m5C plays a role in regulating viral RNA functions impacting virus-host interactions and viral life cycles. In three aims, using virologic, molecular, biochemical, high-throughput sequencing, and small animal model approaches: i) SINV will be exploited to learn how m5C is deposited and how it regulates RNA functions and viral infection and pathogenesis; studies of the related alphavirus CHIKV will allow conserved and virus-specific features to be uncovered, ii) how m5C regulates CVB3 RNA and what effects the modification has on virus replication and CVB3-associated myocarditis will be determined, and iii) SINV and CVB3 will be leveraged to characterize unknown functions of the NSUN2 and NSUN5 MTases, respectively, and as probes to discover novel m5C binding proteins that can exert their effect by direct binding (“readers”) or by removal of the m5C mark (“erasers”). This work will contribute to our understanding of human biology by revealing fundamental principles and functions of this widespread mark in the epitranscriptome with implications for its roles in maintaining cellular homeostasis. Since m5C methylation is a cellular process exploited by numerous viruses, this study could yield new targets for antiviral intervention.

 The current pandemic has highlighted fundamental gaps in our knowledge about the replication strategies
of coronaviruses, and how these are affected by the host at both the organismal and cellular level. There is a
pressing need to understand how SARS-CoV-2 infection and host-cell responses trigger such a diverse set of
pathologies, and the roles played by viral variation, host genetics and underlying preconditions. As studies of
SARS-CoV-2 frequently utilize population-based assays that look hours to days post infection, information on
cellular and spatial variability are lost. Furthermore, host responses are communicative spatial processes subject
to signaling gradients that vary between cells. Thus, averages over populations obscure heterogeneity and
spatial separations, and miss the earliest viral and host behaviors due to lack of sensitivity.
 To fill this gap, we developed experimental and computational approaches to quantify individual virion
entrance, establishment of the first replicative events, and production of viral RNAs and host responses in single
cells, all while maintaining sample spatial integrity. This project’s long-term objective is to apply this novel
approach to gain insights into SARS-CoV-2 biology distinct from those gleaned using traditional strategies. This
knowledge will provide new insight into the spectrum of COVID-19 disease outcomes and help guide future
therapeutic strategies.
 To this end, single-molecule in situ analyses, including single molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization
(smFISH) and multiplexed error-robust FISH (MERFISH) will be applied to the study of SARS-CoV-2. Aim 1 will
quantify SARS-CoV-2 entry, replication and spread, and host transcriptional responses in cells of varying tissue
origin. These data will be used to develop a stochastic computational model to address the determinants of early
viral replication and the resulting cellular response. Aim 2 will examine the effect of host mutations or pre-existing
conditions that affect the type I interferon (IFN) response and have been associated with severe COVID-19, as
well as emerging viral Variants of Concern. Aim 3 will model patient comorbidities in vivo using mouse models
of SARS-CoV-2 infection, identifying the functional and spatial consequences of host responses, including IFN
and other cytokine expression, in the respiratory tract and lung. We will further utilize these in vivo models to
understand why pathogenesis and disease outcome differ depending on the inoculum dose and the age of the
animal. Together, our multidisciplinary approach utilizing techniques and information from systems-level virology,
spatial transcriptomics, host genetics, computational biology, and innate immunity provides a powerful means of
probing questions central to understanding clinical outcome and informing life-saving interventions.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Encephalitic flavivirus infections affect thousands of people globally every year causing acute encephalomyelitis and placing significant burden on healthcare systems. Currently, no virus-specific treatments are available for these life-threatening conditions. The central nervous system (CNS) encompasses dozens of cell types with diverse properties and functions. Limited by a lack of adequate tools that combine throughput, depth and resolution, the interactions between viruses and this complex environment remain largely a mystery. To complicate matters, the CNS is also extensively connected to the periphery by both physical neural projections and peripheral immune signaling. Our preliminary studies demonstrate that tropism of the important encephalitic virus West Nile (WNV) within the CNS after direct intracranial inoculation of mice differs from that seen after spread to the CNS following peripheral infection. We hypothesize that CNS tropism is largely determined by resident neural and glial innate immune profiles, which can be readily modified by immune signals generated during peripheral infection. To address this hypothesis, we will utilize WNV to study immune interactions between cell types in an in vivo mouse model and in vitro using human induced pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) models. Tissue clearing techniques and whole mount imaging will be used to visualize viral antigens across the entire brain and spinal cord using light sheet microscopy, creating a complete time-resolved 3-dimensional map of infection. Responses of single cells will be examined using a combination of cutting-edge nuclear RNA sequencing and microscopy-based spatial transcriptomics. Co-cultures of hPSC-derived neurons and glia will be interrogated using high-throughput microscopy and sequencing to identify resistance factors and responses in human cell types. Hits will be mechanistically studied using blocking antibodies and CRISPR-mediated knockouts. Lastly, by using systemic and cell-type specific knock out animals or cytokine neutralizing antibodies, we will investigate the role of type I interferon in modulating CNS tropism and disease. This project will provide new data on flaviviral encephalitis at unparalleled resolution to help bridge current information gaps and improve fundamental knowledge by defining cellular tropism and CNS inflammatory responses at the single cell level and evaluating how changes in peripheral signaling influence infection of the brain. Identified peripheral factors restricting CNS infection are possible targets for immunomodulatory therapy, thus promoting research that may improve treatment for other forms of viral encephalitis. Finally, the resulting experimental pipeline will be broadly applicable to the study of CNS stress and inflammation, with relevance to other diseases like Lyme neuroborreliosis or chronic debilitating conditions like traumatic brain injury.

 More than 250 million people are chronically infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV), living at increased
risk of liver failure, cancer, and early death. Though there is a vaccine to prevent HBV infection, it does not
prevent vertical transfer, nor does it help the millions of people already infected. While there are therapies (e.g.
nucleoside analogs) to suppress virus replication, treatment is life-long and rarely leads to cure. Achieving a
functional cure for chronic HBV infection therefore represents a major global unmet medical need.
 Fortunately, new classes of HBV inhibitors are being developed and some have already entered clinical
trials, but many fundamental (and clinically-relevant) aspects of HBV biology remain unanswered. The broad
long-term objectives of this project are to address knowledge gaps in the field using a new cell culture-based
method we developed to initiate HBV replication with RNA. Specifically, we capitalize on the most unique
features of this technology to (i) address a practical problem of drug development—antiviral resistance, (ii) to
fill gaps in our fundamental knowledge of HBV protein translation and genome replication, and (iii) as a
discovery tool to identify host factors that restrict or promote the HBV lifecycle.
 There is currently no way to assess antiviral resistance with existing HBV cell culture-based systems.
With our RNA approach, we take advantage of the fact that phage polymerases (e.g. T7) commonly used to in
vitro-transcribe RNA are error-prone. As such, initiating HBV replication with RNA rather than DNA (like most
systems) allows a diverse population of viral variants to be sampled. As we show with compelling preliminary
data, this sequence diversity coupled with deep sequencing technology makes it possible to select for and
detect rare HBV drug-resistant viral variants. Aim 1 of this proposal is to further develop this technology.
 Initiating HBV replication with RNA largely eliminates the background signal that contaminates HBV
qPCR reactions, and since not all viral RNAs are required to initiate replication, some viral proteins are made
only if the viral lifecycle progresses and the viral DNA template—covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA)—is
established. We capitalize on this in Aim 2 to study fundamental aspects of HBV protein translation and
genome replication, and in Aim 3 to discover virus-host interactions. Specifically we use the method in Aim 2 to
study mutations that frequently arise in chronically infected individuals and differences in HBV genotypes. We
use the method in Aim 3 as the basis for a genome-wide CRISPR knockout screen to identify HBV host factors.
 Until we have a solution for eliminating chronic HBV, continuing and new fundamental studies of HBV
biology are needed to identify new strategies that can be explored for therapeutic intervention. The new RNA-
based system we developed to study HBV biology and assess antiviral resistance align well with the NIH's
strategic plan to cure chronic HBV and the work we propose will contribute significantly to this ongoing effort.

 A functional immune system is central to human health and, at the same time, alterations of normal lymphoid
developmental programs can lead to immune deficiencies, autoimmune diseases and a variety of lymphomas.
Germinal centers (GCs) are microanatomical structures formed in secondary lymphoid organs during antigen-
stimulated immune responses. GCs are the sites of B cell maturation through clonal expansion, somatic
hypermutation, and affinity-mediated selection -- and therefore play a critical role in differentiation of antibody
secreting cells and memory B cells. OCA-B is a unique transcriptional coactivator that is highly expressed in GC
B cells and GC-derived lymphomas such as diffuse large B cell lymphoma and Burkitt’s lymphoma. In vivo
studies have demonstrated that OCA-B is essential for both antigen-dependent B cell differentiation (including
GC formation) and normal expression of secondary immunoglobulin genes. However, little is known about the
exact role of OCA-B in normal GC formation and GC-derived lymphoma progression. In addition, the mechanism
by which OCA-B regulates its target genes is also unclear. In addressing these issues, our preliminary studies
have demonstrated (i) a functional occupancy of OCA-B on distal enhancers, in particular the large locus control
region (LCR) of the BCL6 gene that encodes a master regulator of GC formation; (ii) direct interactions of OCA-
B with the MED1 subunit of the Mediator coactivator complex and with a GC-specific transcription factor (MEF2B)
important for BCL6 expression and (iii) a B cell-intrinsic Oca-B dependency for GC B cell differentiation in vivo.
 Based on our previous OCA-B studies and recent preliminary data, we hypothesize that a predominant role
of OCA-B in GC formation involves activation of BCL6 through its distal enhancer region by recruiting and
concentrating transcription factors and cofactors, including chromatin/epigenetic factors, that facilitate enhancer-
promoter interactions. We also hypothesis that OCA-B plays a critical role in GC-derived lymphomagenesis. To
address these issues, we will investigate (i) the function and mechanism of action of OCA-B, through interactions
with MED1/Mediator and MEF2B, on the BCL6 LCR/super-enhancer in both ex vivo GC B and lymphoma cells,
(ii) the mechanism of action of OCA-B-dependent transcriptional coactivation through rigorous biochemical in
vitro transcription assays; (iii) the mechanism of action of OCA-B in GC B cell differentiation in vivo, including
identification of key target genes and regulatory networks; (iv) the role of OCA-B in B cell lymphoma progression
in vivo. We will use complementary biochemical, genomic, bioinformatic, genetic, gene-editing, cell-based and
in vivo (mouse model) approaches. Completion of these aims will advance our understanding of the molecular
mechanism of action of OCA-B in GC-specific transcriptional regulation, GC B cell differentiation, and GC-
derived B cell lymphomagenesis. Notably, it also will provide clues to new therapeutic strategies for treating B
cell lymphomas.

Epidermodysplasia verruciformis (EV) was the first described primary immunodeficiency (PID). By 1946, it was
shown by Lutz to be an autosomal recessive (AR) predisposition to skin-tropic viruses, prior to the description of
congenital neutropenia by Kostmann (1950). Its lack of associated immunological phenotypes long prevented its
recognition as a PID. EV is characterized by disseminated and persistent flat warts, which often evolve into skin
cancer. The lesions are caused by E5- and E8-deficient members of the β genus of human papillomaviruses
(HPVs), which exclusively reside in keratinocytes and remain silent in the general population. EV typically strikes
otherwise healthy individuals (“isolated EV”), or rarely occurs in the context of other infectious diseases
(“syndromic EV”). In 2002, bi-allelic mutations in TMC6 and TMC8, encoding EVER1 and EVER2, were found in
patients with isolated EV, whose T cells were normal. Bi-allelic mutations in CIB1 were reported in 2018 in other
patients with isolated EV. Remarkably, CIB1, EVER1, and EVER2 form a complex that binds to E5 and E8. This
complex operates as a restriction factor governing keratinocyte-intrinsic immunity to β-HPVs. From 2012 onward,
mutations in RHOH, STK4, and other T cell genes were found in patients with syndromic EV. We hypothesize
that other, related single-gene inborn errors of cutaneous immunity against β-HPVs, underlie EV in other patients.
The goal of this application is thus to analyze in greater depth the molecular and cellular basis of isolated and
syndromic EV. First, we will discover new genetic etiologies of EV thanks to the ongoing recruitment of unrelated
EV families, by combining genome-wide linkage (GWL) and whole exome sequencing (WES). Second, we will
functionally characterize the novel genotypes by studying the mutant proteins in isolation and in the patients’
cells, including their relationship with the products of the known EV-causing genes, such as the EVER-CIB1
complex in keratinocytes and RhoH or STK4 in T cells. Third, we will model HPV infection of keratinocytes in the
presence of T cells in vitro, with viral proteins and particles, using keratinocyte cell lines, foreskin keratinocytes,
the patients’ keratinocytes, or induced pluripotent step cell (iPSC)-derived keratinocytes, which will be edited by
CRISPR/Cas9. Our project is highly innovative yet supported by strong preliminary data. Indeed, we have
recruited 52 novel families, identified three novel genetic etiologies, underlying isolated (mutations in RBPJ) or
syndromic EV (ITGAL and OX40), and began elucidating their mechanistic connection with keratinocytes and T
cells, respectively. Our research provides novel insights into the mechanisms of cutaneous immunity to β-HPVs,
highlighting the dual contribution of keratinocyte-intrinsic immunity and T-cell adaptive immunity. Our research
benefits EV patients and families, with the development of novel diagnostic approaches, including genetic
counseling, and facilitating the development of novel therapeutic approaches based on a rational understanding
of the pathogenesis. Finally, the study of EV is a fruitful model to analyze other mucosal and cutaneous illnesses
caused by other HPVs.

Chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis (CMC) is characterized by lesions of the nails, skin, and oral and genital
mucosae by the fungus Candida albicans. Autosomal recessive (AR) IL-17RA, IL-17RC, and ACT1 deficiencies,
and autosomal dominant (AD) IL-17F deficiency underlie ‘isolated CMC’, while AR CARD9, ROR-g/gT, ZNF341,
IL-12p40, and IL-12Rβ1 deficiencies, AD STAT3, IL6ST/GP130, and JNK1 deficiencies, and AD STAT1 gain-of-
function (GOF) underlie ‘syndromic CMC’. Cells with IL-17RA, IL-17RC, ACT1, or JNK1 deficiency respond poorly
to IL-17A and IL-17F. Cells with IL-17RA or ACT1 deficiency also respond poorly to IL-17E (IL-25). Patients with
ROR-g/gT, ZNF341, STAT3, IL6ST, or JNK1 deficiency, or STAT1 GOF, display low proportions of IL-17A/IL-17F
(IL-17A/F)-producing T cells. Since 2008, we have made major contributions to these discoveries that causally
connected inborn errors of IL-17 immunity with CMC. Three outstanding enigmas are (i) the mechanisms by which
STAT1 mutations can be GOF and by which they impair the development of IL-17 T cells, (ii) the mechanisms by
which inborn errors of STAT3 that impair IL-17 production underlie CMC, while inborn errors of STAT3-activating
cytokines IL-6, IL-21, and IL-23 apparently do not, and (iii) the genetic etiology of about half of the patients with
isolated or syndromic CMC. We first intend to test the hypotheses that (a) STAT1 GOF mutations impair the
dephosphorylation of nuclear STAT1 by disrupting the formation of antiparallel dimers, thereby preventing the
accessibility of specific phosphatases, and that (b) excessive responses of T cells to IFN-a, IFN-g, and IL-27
collectively impair the development of Th17 cells. We then intend to analyze the production of IL-17 cytokines by
leukocytes from patients with IL-6R, IL-21R, or IL-23R deficiency, in comparison with known etiologies of CMC,
testing the hypothesis that the isolated disruption of IL-6, IL-21, or IL-23 only weakly impairs the development of
Th17 and related IL-17-producing lymphocytes. We finally intend to discover novel CMC-causing genes using
genome-wide (GW) approaches, based on GW linkage (GWL), and whole-exome or whole-genome sequencing
(WES/WGS). On the three fronts, we have exciting preliminary results. We found (i) that all STAT1 variants tested
are GOF due to impaired dephosphorylation by the tyrosine phosphatases TC-PTP and PTP1B, by disruption of
antiparallel dimers formation; and the concomitant addition of STAT1-dependent cytokines IFN-a/b, IFN-g, and
IL-27 inhibits the development of IL-17 T cells from naïve CD4+ T cells with STAT1 GOF; (ii) patients with AR IL-
6R or IL-23R deficiency and CMC, implying incomplete penetrance; and (iii) patients with syndromic CMC and
mutations of cRel, RelB, MAP3K6 (also known as ASK2), ZNF375 (zDHHC5), or UBASH3B (TULA-2). From a
biological standpoint, this research will provide new insights into the mechanisms of mucocutaneous immunity to
fungi, while dissecting the molecular and cellular control of human IL-17. From a clinical angle, this work will
provide new molecular diagnoses for patients and genetic counseling for families, while paving the way for new
cytokine-based approaches in patients with CMC.

Generating an appropriate antibody response is critical for protection against reinfection and for the effectiveness
of vaccination, particularly in the context of viral diseases. In addition to well-studied quantitative parameters
such as antibody titer and affinity, other, more qualitative parameters related to the clonal composition of the
response also play critical roles in antibody-mediated protection. These include antigen and epitope specificity,
which is key to viral neutralization capacity and antibody breadth, and overall clonal diversity, which strongly
influences the degree of immunodominance and therefore the ability of viruses to escape immunity by mutation.
Despite their importance, such “ecological” aspects of GC biology remain poorly understood and systematically
understudied at the mechanistic level.
Our long-term goal is to develop a mechanistic understanding of how the competitive waxing and waning of B
cell clones at the various stages of the immune response shapes the ultimate composition, specificity, and
protective efficacy of serum antibody. In our previous studies, using multicolor “Brainbow”-based B cell fate-
mapping models, we focused on the germinal center (GC) and memory phases of the response, revealing how
highly diverse early responders are funneled towards oligoclonality, first progressively by GC selection (including
in chronic gut-associated GC) and then dramatically by secondary boosting. We now propose to extend our work
using these same tools to investigate the clonal dynamics of prolonged selection in long-lived virus-induced GCs
(Aim 1) and of the progressive differentiation of plasmablasts and plasma cells from GC precursors (Aim 2). We
also propose a new “molecular fate-mapping” system to determine how clonal dynamics impact the ultimate
composition of serum antibody (Aim 3). This allows us to investigate the B cell biology of serum-level phenomena
such as antigenic imprinting/original antigenic sin, immunodominance, and viral escape.
We expect our findings will provide greater mechanistic understanding of how the composition and protective
effectiveness of serum antibody is determined by the dynamics of B cell clonal competition, with implications for
the design of effective vaccination strategies for influenza, HIV, and SARS-CoV-2.

Insects are the primary vectors for many deadly diseases. Mosquitoes and other biting insects rely on their
exquisite sense of smell to identify and hone in on their human hosts. Consequently, one strategy to control the
transmission of insect-borne diseases is to target insect olfactory receptors, disrupt the initial detection of
human volatiles, and prevent insects from locating humans. The goal of developing potent insect repellents that
cripple host-seeking behavior is greatly facilitated by the unique molecular nature of insect olfactory receptors.
Insect olfactory receptors form a novel class of heteromeric ion channels comprised of two distinct subunits—a
highly divergent odorant receptor (OR) subunit that confers odorant specificity and a common Orco subunit,
that is virtually invariant amongst diverse insect species, reflecting its essential role in olfactory transduction.
Given the conserved and critical role that Orco plays in odor detection, it forms an ideal molecular target for a
much-needed new generation of insect repellents with the potential to halt the transmission of insect-borne
diseases. Unfortunately, as these receptors represent a unique specialization of insects and lack structural
homology to any other ion channel family, many of their most elementary structural and functional properties
have remained elusive, precluding sufficient mechanistic understanding to guide repellent design. To fill this
important void in the field, my lab recently determined the structure of an Orco homomeric channel using cryo-
electron microscopy, providing the first structural snapshot of an insect olfactory receptor. Building on this
advance and our expertise in odorant receptor biochemistry, we propose to elucidate the structure of Orco in
conditions that replicate its native environment: embedded within a lipid membrane (Aim 1) and assembled
with an OR to form a heteromeric channel (Aim 2), alone and in complex with synthetic agonists and odorants.
Revealing multiple structures of insect olfactory receptors in both apo and ligand bound states will provide
direct insight into the structural and mechanistic basis for their allosteric modulation. Together, the proposed
studies offer a unique and powerful inroad to the rational design of small-molecule repellents that disrupt odor
detection and host-seeking behavior in insect vectors of human disease.

Adult neurogenesis is emerging as an important player in maintaining brain homeostasis and normal functions.
The dysfunctions of neurogenesis have been associated with aging and neurological disorders, including
Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The ability to systematically map the molecular dynamics of neurogenesis at single-
cell resolution could serve as a foundation for a systematic effort to better understand the molecular events that
give rise to abnormal cell states in aging and diseases. While the rapid advances in single-cell genomics are
creating unprecedented opportunities to explore molecular heterogeneity in mammalian brains, nearly all such
methods are restricted to low throughput and fail to recover the heterogeneity and dynamics of the profoundly
rare cell states in adult neurogenesis (e.g., less than 0.1% of the cell population in the brain). Herein, we propose
to develop novel methodologies that enable a comprehensive view of temporal-spatial dynamics of neurogenesis
during aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD) in both human and mouse brains. Specifically, we will first develop a
novel high-throughput, low-cost single-cell genomics approach, sciNext1000, to profile the molecular
heterogeneity of four million cells from post-mortem human hippocampal samples. This approach will be powerful
because we can not only quantitatively characterize the frequency of human adult hippocampal neurogenesis at
single-cell resolution, but also identify the transcriptome features associated with impaired neurogenesis in aging
and AD at isoform resolution. In addition, we will develop another novel single-cell genomic technique, sci-Div-
seq, to enhance the detection of newborn neurons, and identify the cellular differentiation trajectories and
associated transcriptomic features of adult neurogenesis in young and aged mouse brains. The resulting dataset
will advance our understanding of gene regulation in neurogenesis across different neural lineages and
constitute a significant step towards a comprehensive characterization of the molecular mechanism underlying
neurogenesis impairment in aging. In addition to the internal molecular programs, the neurogenesis process is
controlled by aspects of environmental signals from the neural stem niche. We will apply a high-throughput
spatial transcriptomic strategy to identify the cellular interactions and local microenvironment involved in adult
neurogenesis in both human and mouse brains. These multi-pronged approaches will open a new paradigm for
understanding the global molecular programs and environmental regulation of adult neurogenesis, thereby
informing potential therapeutic targets to restore cell population homeostasis in aging and brain disorders.

Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a chronic psychiatric disorder with severe societal consequences that impacts
over 15 million adults in the USA and 76 million worldwide. Ethanol exposure early in life, particularly in utero,
strikingly alters fetal brain development and increases the risk for AUD. Even exposure to low concentrations of
ethanol can produce the most prevalent, milder forms of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder. Our recent studies in
the rat demonstrate that prenatal exposure to low levels of ethanol, in addition to increasing ethanol consumption
and anxiety in the offspring, stimulates neurogenesis with negligible cytotoxic effects. Interestingly, prenatal
ethanol stimulates the density of neurons expressing hypocretin/orexin (Hcrt), an orexigenic neuropeptide
located almost exclusively in the hypothalamus that has a major role in promoting AUD-related behaviors. These
compelling effects observed in our rodent model led us to seek a simpler vertebrate model to investigate in real-
time, at cellular and anatomical levels, the mechanisms involved in ethanol’s effects on embryonic development
of Hcrt neurons. The zebrafish (ZF) is a perfect vertebrate model system for our studies, due to its optical
accessibility and external development, its small size and low cost, and its comparable CNS that develops early
and rapidly alongside a relatively sophisticated behavioral repertoire. With our recent publications showing a
conservation of ethanol’s effects across species, we established in our laboratory a variety of techniques
particularly suited for comprehensive studies of the ZF brain, including time-lapse live imaging, optogenetics,
calcium imaging, and in vivo targeted laser ablation, and obtained preliminary results revealing robust and
unexpected changes in Hcrt neurons and neuroimmune systems that may lead to the formation of specific
asymmetric Hcrt subpopulations. Based on these new findings, we propose to test the following hypothesis:
Embryonic exposure to ethanol at low doses has diverse effects on the development of Hcrt neurons, which are
mediated by dynamic changes in local inflammatory chemokine systems and contribute to the formation of
asymmetric, abnormally-located Hcrt subpopulations that exhibit altered neural activity and are causally related
to disturbances in ethanol consumption and associated behaviors. In 3 specific aims, we plan in ZF embryonically
exposed to low-dose ethanol: 1) to thoroughly characterize Hcrt neuronal development along with behavior,
under normal conditions and after ethanol exposure, and directly test the behavioral functions of these neurons;
2) to precisely determine, at a single-cell level, if Hcrt neurons in specific subpopulations are unique in their birth
date, site of origin, migratory path, and signaling activity, and if they are causally related to behavioral
disturbances; and 3) to test the possibility that effects of embryonic ethanol on Hcrt neuronal development and
behavior are mediated by local neuroimmune systems, specifically CXCL12a/CXCR4b/CXCR7b and
CCL2/CCR2. This research aims to elucidate in depth the dynamic and diverse neuropeptide, neuroimmune and
behavioral changes caused by low levels of in utero ethanol exposure that increase the risk for AUD.

Squamous cell carcinoma is a major cause of death worldwide. Despite advances in cancer genetics, alterations
in post-translational modifications are poorly understood. Protein glycosylation is the most abundant PTM and
altered in cancer. Glycans are not directly encoded in the genome but rather are comprised of up to ten
monosaccharides in various linkages to form thousands of structures, making their structural and functional
characterization challenging and largely unknown in SCC. To address this, I propose to use murine skin as a
highly tractable model system to study altered glycosylation, downstream consequences, and identify novel
therapies. In the K99, I will use glycan binding proteins, metabolic labeling, advanced microscopy, MALDI
imaging, glycomics, glycoproteomics, and single cell transcriptomics to spatially map glycosylation and identify
specific glycan and glycoprotein changes in a genetic, multi-hit, histologically progressive model of SCC from
papilloma to SCC, before chemotherapy, and after recurrence (Aim I). Next in the K99, I will use our in utero
lentivirus technology to transduce epidermis and perform a large-scale, unbiased, in vivo, functional genomics
screen of the ~700 glycogenes to define the role of glycosylation in SCC (Aim II). Lastly in the R00, I will combine
glycoproteomics, single cell transcriptomics of the tumor and microenvironment, protein-specific glycan editing,
and high-throughput drug screens to identify mechanisms of glycan-driven tumorigenesis and novel therapeutic
candidates (Aim III). My background in glycobiology, medical oncology, and mentorship from leading skin and
cancer biologist Dr. Elaine Fuchs at the outstanding training environments at Rockefeller University and
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, as a postdoctoral and medical oncology fellow, will position me to
tackle these important questions and learn techniques, knowledge, and leadership to establish a career as a
leading independent investigator and physician-scientist in cancer glycobiology.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The long-term goal of our research is to decipher the essential molecular mechanisms underlying successful cell
division. Errors in this process have been linked to developmental defects and diseases such as cancer. We
now know essentially every protein needed for cell division. However, analyzing the precise molecular
mechanisms needed for error-free division has continued to be very challenging for at least three reasons. First,
cell division in human cells is a highly dynamic process that can be completed in <1 hour, with key steps such
as chromosome-microtubule attachments and nuclear envelop reformation taking only a few minutes. Second,
the microtubule-based structures that dynamically self-assemble and function in dividing cells can be ~1000-
times larger than their nanometer-sized protein components. Third, this multi-step process depends on several
distinct protein-protein interactions that can be transient and mitosis-specific. To address these challenges and
fill gaps in our knowledge we have: (i) Discovered and characterized cell-permeable chemical inhibitors of key
mechanoenzymes (e.g. AAA, ATPases associated with diverse cell processes). These chemical probes can be
used to rapidly (typically, within minutes) inhibit or activate (through relief from inhibition) protein function in
dividing human cells. We combine these fast perturbations with state-of-the-art microscopy (e.g. lattice light-
sheet microscopy) and quantitative image analysis to dissect mechanisms underlying cell division dynamics in
human cells. To identify target-specific phenotypes we carry out parallel inhibitor dose-dependent analyses in
matched cell lines that are either inhibitor-sensitive or -resistant. (ii) Deciphered how micrometer-sized features
(e.g. microtubule length or overlap length) can effectively be measured by nanometer-sized proteins to generate
proportionate outputs (e.g. tags or force). For these studies we have generated a biochemical ‘toolbox’
comprised of recombinant forms of the augmin complex, isotypically-pure human tubulin, key microtubule-
associated motor and non-motor proteins and g-TuRC (g -tubulin ring complex), the major microtubule nucleator
in human cells. (iii) Developed and applied chemical proteomics approaches to ‘capture’ and profile direct,
transient and context-dependent protein-protein interactions in living cells. The research proposed benefits from
our expertise and will combine chemical, structural and cell biology approaches to answer long-standing
questions, including: (a) What are the functions of different AAA mechanoenzymes during cell division and how
are their activities regulated? (b) What is the structural basis of g-TuRC-dependent microtubule nucleation and
how does this complex contribute to centrosome-dependent and -independent microtubule formation during
mitosis? Our research should provide new insights into fundamental mechanisms, uncover general principles
that inform on other cellular processes (e.g. microtubule organization in neurons), and may provide starting
points for developing new therapeutics.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), is an ongoing global health crisis. The WHO
reports 10 million active cases and over 1.5 million deaths annually. RNA polymerase (RNAP), the enzyme
responsible for all transcription in bacteria, is the target for rifampicin, a first-line treatment for TB. RNAP is thus
a proven and attractive target for developing new drugs. These facts highlight the importance of our recent
structural and functional characterization of Mtb RNAP, and the essential transcription factors required for full
transcriptional activity and intrinsic antibiotic resistance. In addition, we have found that studying diverse clades
of bacteria deepens our understanding of general principles of transcription. Therefore, we study Actinobacteria,
as the biophysical and molecular mechanisms of transcription in this clade are relatively understudied and
because it includes important pathogens.
We determined high-resolution cryo-EM structures of several Mtb initiation transcription complexes with essential
transcription factors and important antibiotics in the previous funding period. Here my vision is to complete the
characterization of initiation regulation and expand our focus to the post-initiation steps throughout the
transcription cycle. These steps include elongation, pausing (a regulatory step where the RNAP temporarily halts
at specific sequences, permitting input from diverse signals), and termination. We will also continue
characterizing new RNAP inhibitors.
To complete our understanding of initiation, we will continue our studies of the WhiB factors, focusing on the
essential factor WhiB1, which is required for Mtb viability and response to stress. To characterize post-initiation
steps, we plan to study the mechanisms of mycobacterial NusA and NusG. NusG in Mycobacteria increases
transcriptional pausing and termination, yet it suppresses both in the well-characterized E. coli. This difference
in activity emphasizes the need to study these factors in other clades of bacteria. Most of these studies will
involve single-particle cryo-EM, but we plan to extend our studies in situ by using cryo-electron tomography to
investigate cellular processes and organizations, such as ribosomal coupling to RNAP. To rigorously study how
transcription factors act genome-wide, we will finish developing cell-free genomics: using genomic DNA as a
substrate for purified RNAP and transcription factors, and quantifying resultant transcripts with RNA-seq. This
method is necessary to identify native DNA sequences regulated by essential factors WhiB1, NusA, and NusG,
whose regulons have remained elusive due to pleiotropy upon perturbation in cells.
In sum, I envision using a multidisciplinary approach that includes structural, genetic, biochemical, genomic, and
in situ experiments to understand the roles and mechanisms of each step in the transcription cycle and how they
are regulated by cis and trans-acting elements. The results from this proposal have the potential to elucidate the
molecular and biological mechanisms of the entire transcription cycle.

A major challenge in understanding how organs take shape is addressing how increases in morphological
complexity arise. Over the past half-century, our understanding of such symmetry-breaking has been
predominantly developed through molecular, genetic, and cellular frameworks. However, symmetry-breaking in
developing organs occurs at scales far larger than their individual molecular and cellular constituents, prompting
the question of how events at the molecular and cellular scale relate to the physical self-organization of organ
structure. To address this question, my lab centers its studies on the behavior of cell collectives, an understudied
nexus that serves as a mediator between subcellular processes and functionally relevant organ morphology. Our
prior work in considering collective cell, or supracellular, material properties has led to the hypothesis that the
role of key signals, known as morphogens, in sculpting organs is to influence cells and extracellular matrix such
that tissue material properties or “phase” are modulated. Thus, a key functional role of morphogens may be to
create diversity in supracellular mechanical behavior by fluidizing or solidifying tissue domains that result in the
increase of complexity in organ form. Here we will use a unique set of supracellular behavioral assays to
investigate new roles for signals in shaping emerging morphologies. We will first link where and when
morphogens are expressed in the forming follicle to the transcriptional profiles and multicellular architectures
that accompany morphogen activity (Aim 1). We will then leverage a constellation of novel collective cell
mechanics platforms to probe the functional consequence of morphogen activity at the supracellular scale. (Aim
2). Finally, through the integration of theory and experiment, we will explore the hypothesis that interacting
supracellular phases generate a mechanical instability in the skin that is sufficient to shape the organ (Aim 3).
Together these studies stand to highlight the need to consider supracellular properties necessary for tissue
symmetry breaking that are not reducible to the properties of individual cells. At the same time, our studies will
identify the molecular and cellular component parts that enable the diversification of emergent supracellular
material properties. Our investigations will pave the way for a generalizable paradigm for how morphogens can
create adjacent material phases within a single tissue, thereby generating the potential for mechanical self-
organization at the tissue scale. Finally, these studies will shed light on the multi-scale nature of organ formation
and serve as a foundation for future work aimed at addressing congenital defects, engineering stromal tissues
of specific material properties, and the rational channeling supracellular self-organizing potential in regenerative
medicine.

Innate behaviors are hard-wired and shared among most mammals, however, it is still not fully understood how
these behaviors arise and what neuronal mechanisms control behavior selection. The goal of this proposal is
to study feeding behavior as a typical innate behavior to determine the fundamentals of a circuit that connects
sensing of the body’s energy state to motor centers for food consumption. This will be done using an
integrative approach at behavior, circuit, neuron and synapse level that takes advantage of my existing
and proposed training in neuroscience. Results will shed light on the neuronal computations that
transform sensations of energy state into motor sequences of chewing and biting and will advance our
understanding of behavior selection.
Feeding behavior is elicited by changes in bodily energy state (fasted vs. fed) that result in jaw movements of
chewing and biting. In contrast to other behaviors, the motor and premotor neurons for jaw muscles are located
in the brain and not the spine. Thus, the arc from hunger sensation to motor control is fully brain-based. I
previously identified a simple circuit for food consumption that connects neurons sensitive to signals of bodily
energy state via only one intermediate node to premotor areas controlling biting and chewing. Building on this
data, the mentored phase aims to delineate the role of premotor neurons and their activity patterns with
respect to the hypothesis that premotor neurons are structured in a motor map for bite purposes. This aim
aligns with my training plan to gain expertise in RNA profiling and single cell calcium imaging through my
advisory committee and the high-quality scientific core and support opportunities at Rockefeller University.
Additionally, I will also take advantage of the career development and lab management training opportunities
offered locally and by the Tri-Institute area. Next, during the independent phase, I will use these skills to
elucidate the computations that lead to the behavior selection of feeding and the effect of internal sensations of
energy state change. Specifically, it will be determined how competing behaviors (social interactions, fear) can
suppress feeding and how integration of food-derived sensations (sight, smell) and bodily signals causes food
consumption. This phase is the logical extension of my extensive training in neuroscience and my career
objectives to lead my own research group for which this proposal forms the basis of my research direction.
Results from this study will shed light on the conceptual principles of how innate behaviors are encoded along
a simple sensory to motor circuit. Additionally, results will also provide insight into the mechanisms of energy
state coupling with food intake which has important implications for obesity and eating disorders. Finally, this
proposal will equip me with the training and initial data needed to start an independent research program that
is different from my mentors and aligned with my career goals of studying innate behavior in the context of
interoception.

Liver cancer is the third leading cause of cancer-related death and is associated with diverse range of oncogenic
alterations. These driver mutations impact clinical outcomes, disease prognosis and response to therapy.
Treatment options for liver cancer include a few multi-kinase inhibitors and surgical resection, providing only
limited survival benefits. To this end, genotype-guided therapeutic approaches are urgently needed in clinics.
Metabolism-focused approaches have recently gained interest to be explored as anti-cancer therapy. However,
it is poorly understood how specific oncogenic alterations impact tumor metabolism and which tumors would
benefit from metabolism-based therapies. Given the complex cellular and nutritional composition of tumors,
studying tumor metabolism at cellular resolution is quite challenging. In this study, I propose a way to overcome
this challenge by employing an organelle pull-down technology and profiling mitochondrial metabolites of cancer
cells from highly heterogeneous tumor tissues. In my preliminary work, I focused on mitochondria, a central
biosynthetic hub for cellular metabolism, applied the mitochondrial immunoprecipitation method (mito-IP) to
capture cancer cell mitochondria from in vivo transformed liver tumors driven by different oncogenic alterations,
including c-MYC; p53-/- and KrasG12D; p53-/-. This approach enabled mitochondrial metabolite profiling by LC/MS
and identified metabolite changes specific to each oncogenic alteration. In particular, I found enrichment of
creatine metabolism intermediates; guanidinoacetate, creatine (Cr) and phosphocreatine (P-Cr), specifically in
KrasG12D tumors. Mitochondrial proteomics corroborated these findings, revealed upregulation of Gatm, the rate
limiting enzyme in creatine biosynthesis, in KrasG12D tumors. Building upon these findings, in this proposal, I will
test the central hypothesis that oncogenes impose distinct metabolic alterations in mitochondria, which can be
exploited as targeted therapies. I will first test the essentiality of creatine metabolism for KrasG12D -mutant liver
tumor growth. Then, I will determine the precise mechanisms by which creatine metabolism contributes to
KrasG12D-driven tumorigenesis. Finally, given the success of my in vivo mito-IP approach, I will model frequent
liver cancer mutations to map differentially regulated mitochondrial metabolites and proteins, and identify limiting
metabolic reactions through unbiased genetic screens. By addressing the aims of this proposal, we will gain
mechanistic insight into downstream metabolic effects of oncogenic alterations and potential of genotype-
targeted metabolic therapies for targeting liver cancer. Collectively, these aims will provide foundations of my
future research program committed to understanding how oncogenes (genetic determinants) alter cancer cell
metabolism in vivo, with the goal of exploiting such alterations for genotype-targeted metabolic therapies.

The eukaryotic cell has evolved to compartmentalize DNA within the nucleus, surrounded by the barrier of the
nuclear envelope (NE), providing protection to the DNA and a means to control information flow to and from the
genome. This flow, namely the passage of small molecules, RNAs, and proteins across the NE, is mediated by
large, 8-fold symmetrical structures known as nuclear pore complexes (NPCs). Arranged as a stack of rings, the
NPC scaffold braces open pores within the NE, yet preserves its barrier function with a dense network of
disordered protein domains, rich in repeating phenylalanine-glycine motifs (FG repeats), known as the NPC
central transporter. The largest NPC cargoes, including pre-ribosomal subunits, mRNPs, and proteasome
subcomplexes, approach the width of the ~55 nm NPC channel in size, yet are able to transit the NPC central
transporter. That such large cargoes can traverse the NPC suggests that organized mechanisms and alternate
structural states of the NPC are required to transport large cargoes through the FG repeat network of the central
transporter. To address these questions, our multi-investigator, multi-site collaborative team recently determined
structures of the affinity isolated S. cerevisiae budding yeast NPC at 8-11 Å resolution and the in situ yeast NPC
at 30-40 Å resolution (Akey et al., 2022). Comparison of “ground state” (isolated) and “active state” (in situ) NPCs
revealed that radial dilation of the NPC scaffold may accommodate changes in cargo flux or size. We now aim
to investigate the dynamics of NPC transport function of model large cargoes that can be targeted for import into
the nucleus and arrested during transport, allowing us to quantify cargo transport dynamics (function) and map
the location of the transiting cargo within the NPC (structure). We will dissect NPC transport’s energy-
dependence on nuclear Ran-GTP into separate studies of passive, Ran-insensitive cargo targeting to the NPC
(Aim 1) and active, Ran-dependent cargo transport through the NPC (Aim 2). Using well-characterized NPC
transport mutants, we will examine the behavior of actively transporting large cargoes by perturbing specific
stages along the transport path (Aim 3). This level of control will allow us to map transport functions not only to
specific Nups, but to specific regions of Nups. Quantitative fluorescence microscopy and cell fitness assays will
screen for functionally important phenotypes to selectively pursue NPC-cargo interactomics by mass
spectrometry and visualization of NPC structural changes by cryo-electron microscopy. Our functional and
structural data will inform each other in a synergistic but non-dependent fashion to reveal how the NPC adopts
distinct and discrete structural states to perform its transport functions for native (mRNPs, pre-ribosomes) and
non-native (viral capsids, nanocarriers) large cargoes. This comprehensive research strategy will advance our
understanding of (i) constitutive large cargo transport processes and malfunction of this process in disease states
(ii) interactions between viral capsids and NPCs during infection and (iii) nuclear-targeting for nanocarriers in
drug delivery and gene therapy.

 This application is designed to address the scientific goals of FOA-PA-19-112. Coronary microvascular
disease (CMD) is major sequelae of chest radiotherapy in cancer survivors. Blockade of the larger coronary
arteries can be treated by stents or surgical bypass; however, there are no effective therapies currently available
to target CMD. This project aims to investigate the novel and previously unexplored mechanisms of ionizing
radiation (IR)-induced coronary microvascular injury, and test the beneficial effects of a small molecule, N-acetyl-
ser-asp-lys-pro (Ac-SDKP), to counteract these effects. The scientific premise of this proposal is based on our
recent studies demonstrating profound endothelial cell injury with marked increase in coronary vascular
permeability, and fibrosis, after thoracic radiation exposure in rodents. We also found that radiation-induced CMD
was dose-dependently associated with the transcriptional inhibition of claudin-1 (cldn1) expression. Importantly,
administration of Ac-SDKP, a thymosin β4-derived endogenous peptide, normalized endothelial cell
permeability, reconstituted cldn1, and reduced cardiac fibrosis.
 Despite its cardioprotective potential, therapeutic application of Ac-SDKP has been challenging due to
its short half-life (T1/2 of 4.5 mins) in serum. Therefore, we have developed a stable, liposomal Ac-SDKP (Lip-
Ac-SDKP) formulation, which we intend to test for sustained systemic effects. We hypothesize that Ac-SDKP
mitigates radiation-induced coronary endothelial damage, and prevents microvascular leakage by
inhibiting IR-mediated cldn1 loss. In Aim I, we will examine the uptake efficiency and bioactivity of Lip-Ac-
SDKP in the heart and in coronary microvascular endothelial cells. In Aim II, we will examine the effects of Ac-
SDKP on endothelial barrier integrity after radiation and study the role of cldn1 in this process. In Aim III, we
will determine the effects of Ac-SDKP treatment on radiation-induced coronary blood flow and regional and
global cardiac function.
 We will accomplish these aims by using advanced molecular biology and imaging approaches. We have
developed a novel genetically engineered mouse model of endothelial cell-specific cldn1 gain-of-
function. We have also developed a cldn1 loss-of-function model using a next generation in vivo siRNA
delivery technology. Additionally, we will utilize tumor-bearing syngeneic and xenograft models to examine
Ac-SDKP effects after multi-dose thoracic irradiation. This project will provide mechanistic insight on the
protective effects of Ac-SDKP against radiation-induced CMD, and will have important therapeutic implications
for timely and targeted interventions in cancer patients susceptible to radiotherapy-induced CMD and cardiac
ischemia.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：ABSTRACT Epidemiological evidence suggests that environmental exposures during development may play a
role in disease susceptibility later in life, and researchers have hypothesized that epigenetic changes induced
by common toxicants such as pesticides, herbicides, endocrine disruptors, and heavy metals may be
facilitating this link 1,2. The mechanisms by which these changes are induced and propagated remain
challenging to dissect, largely because environmental toxicant induced changes are often 1) subtle when
assayed across the bulk cell population, 2) transient in nature and therefore difficult to reproducibly detect,
and/or 3) randomly distributed throughout the genome, making reproducibility and measurement of statistical
significance challenging. In fact, most studies trying to link toxicant exposures directly to frank cellular
transformation, including our own, have been relative failures. In virtually all cases, in order to see overt
transformation, exposure studies need to be conducted in cell or animal models that already have baseline
genetic or epigenetic changes that facilitate the progression to malignancy.
 We have exciting preliminary data that demonstrates that Ewing sarcoma cells demonstrate a
significantly elevated level of transcriptional and replication stress (RS), and we propose that environmental
exposures may not only induce RS and activate the RSR, but also cause epigenetic changes that precondition
cells to allow for survival following expression of driver fusion proteins despite elevated levels of RS. This
proposal will focus our efforts on understanding the downstream effects of TCDD exposures in mesenchymal
stem cells (MSC) when paired with 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T and investigate the role of STAG2 in modulating
downstream molecular events associated with environmental toxicant exposures. Our overall hypothesis is
that environmental toxicant exposures cooperate with STAG2 loss to increase replication stress, ultimately
leading to genomic and epigenomic instability, and creating a permissive epigenome for fusion gene
expression. Three Specific Aims are proposed:
SPECIFIC AIM 1: To determine whether environmental toxicant exposures increase baseline levels of
replication stress in iMSC and cooperate with STAG2 loss to lead to epigenomic remodeling.
SPECIFIC AIM 2: To determine whether environmental toxicant exposures cooperate with STAG2 loss to lead
increased clonal genetic and epigenetic heterogeneity.
SPECIFIC AIM 3: To determine whether environmental toxicant exposure leads to a permissive epigenome for
survival of pre-malignant cells following fusion protein expression.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：In pediatric health care non-adherence to medications is a significant driver of avoidable suffering and death.
Over half of children do not adhere to prescribed medications, and non-adherence is the leading cause of
treatment failure in pediatrics. Non-adherence can lead to worsening illness, death, preventable hospitalization,
increased health care cost, and morbidity. Even in pediatric cancer, when the consequences of non-adherence
to chemotherapy are potentially life threatening, over 40% of patients have clinically significant non-adherence.
For the most common pediatric cancer, Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL), children who miss just 10% of
chemotherapy doses have a nearly 4-fold risk of cancer relapse. Despite decades of research we do not have
effective strategies to meaningfully increase pediatric medication adherence. The goal of the proposed
research is to reduce preventable pediatric morbidity and mortality through testing a novel target – behavioral
parenting skills – as a modifiable mechanism to improve medication adherence in young children (ages 3-9).
Based upon our preliminary data we have begun to develop CareMeds, a parenting skills-focused adherence
intervention. The goal of this project is to use stages 0 and 1 of the NIH Stage Model to further develop and
evaluate the feasibility of the CareMeds intervention. Evidence is converging on family functioning and
parenting style as critical factors that shape child medication adherence. Yet, previous studies typically rely on
one-time global measures, making it difficult to discern the precise parenting skills that improve medication
adherence. For example, we know very little about what exactly “supportive” or “cohesive” families are doing to
promote medication adherence. In Aim 1 we will use direct observation of medication administration at home to
understand common episode-level barriers and identify the behavioral parenting skills that are most successful
in achieving medication administration in young children. In Aim 2 we will use daily diary data collection to
examine how daily parenting experiences influence the risk of medication non-adherence. We will use data
from Aims 1 and 2 and input from diverse parents to refine the final CareMeds intervention package. In Aim 3
we will conduct a pilot RCT of the intervention versus usual care with 100 families of young children ages 3-9
with ALL within 1 month of initiation of oral chemotherapy prescription. Findings from this program of research
will make significant conceptual contributions through providing nuanced understanding of the aspects of
parenting at the episode and daily levels that shape medication adherence in young children. It will make
innovative methodological advances through use of direct observation of medication administration, daily diary
data on transient parenting experiences, and rigorous measurement of adherence through objective behavioral
measures (electronic pill bottle monitoring) and pharmacological measures (validated biomarkers of drug
metabolites). Finally, it will have significant translational impact through setting the stage for a full-scale, multi-
center, RCT to examine the efficacy of the CareMeds intervention.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：1 Squamous cell skin cancer (SCC) is the second most common cancer in the US. There are methods available
 2 to prevent SCC but are not appropriately used because we lack methods of evaluating their effectiveness in a
 3 timely manner. Ultraviolet light (UV) from the sun induces genomic damage which is the most important cause
 4 of skin cancer. Early in the process of cancer formation UV causes mutations in cells which result in small
 5 clones, clusters of mutated cells. The early mutations that result in the growth of these clones are called
 6 clonogenic mutations (CM). CMs are early changes during SCC formation, which appear decades before
 7 clinically detectable cancer. Based on previous evidence CMs may signal skin cancer risk and evaluate the
 8 efficacy of preventative treatment strategies and sun protection. CM are in low abundance in the skin which
9 make them challenging to detect. However, recent advances in genomic sequencing technology and
10 computational tools allow accurate identification and quantitation of CMs in the skin. Preliminary data has shown
11 that CMS can be accurately detected and used to evaluate sun damaged skin areas. Many of the CMs found in
12 normal sun exposed skin are also common in SCC. The central hypothesis for this application is that CMs are
13 biomarkers of sun induced skin damaged and that CMs can measure how well strategies for skin cancer
14 prevention and preventative treatment work. In the first set of studies we will refine the previously developed
15 panel of sun induced CMs by identifying the most common CMs in sun exposed versus non-sun exposed skin.
16 Subsequent studies will examine the impact of UV exposure on changes in the CM panel and development of
17 skin cancer. These studies will evaluate patterns of CMs and the risk of developing skin cancer. Next, the
18 refined panel of CMs will be used to examine how well treatments designed to prevent skin cancer in heavily
19 sun damaged skin areas reduce CMs and skin cancer formation. In the final set of studies, CMs will be used to
20 evaluate the efficacy of sun protection strategies, such as sunscreens. Sun protection factor (SPF) is widely
21 used to evaluate sunscreens. However, SPF measures reduction in redness of the skin instead of the actual
22 DNA damage. Genomic DNA damage contributes to skin cancer, not “redness” in the skin. Genomic damage
23 can be caused by long term sun damage that does not cause a sunburn. In the final set of studies, CMs are used
24 to evaluate the effectiveness of sunscreens to protect against genomic damage and skin cancer. These studies
25 will change how we evaluate a patient’s risk of developing skin cancer and how we determine the effect of skin
26 cancer prevention. These studies have the potential to shift the focus from treating cancer to preventing the
27 occurrence of skin cancer. This would result in an improvement in cancer care outcomes, improve treatment
28 strategies and ultimately improve the life of individual with a history of sun damage and pre-cancerous lesions.
29 This work focuses on skin cancer but as CMs play a crucial first step in cancer growth in most human cancers
30 our findings and the framework of this study will have implications for the wider field of preventative oncology.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Triple negative breast cancers (TNBCs) do not express estrogen receptor-α (ERα), progesterone receptor (PR),
or human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), and therefore, none of the targeted drugs currently in use
for breast cancer are effective against them. Approximately 60-80% of TNBCs express estrogen receptor-β
(ERβ). However, pro- versus anti-tumorigenic capabilities of ERβ remains controversial. Another key molecular
characteristic of TNBC is the high frequency (80%) of p53 mutation. In addition to losing tumor suppressor
properties and exerting dominant-negative regulation over any remaining wild type p53 (WTp53), mutant p53
also acquires oncogenic gain-of-function. Increasing evidence suggests that not all mutant p53s function
similarly. Although ERβ and p53 have been implicated in TNBC pathology, whether p53 has a role in the pro-
versus anti-proliferative functional duality of ERβ remains an open question. The long-term goal is to understand
and exploit the role of ERβ-p53 crosstalk in breast cancer for the development of better therapeutic strategies.
The objective is to study how specific mutations in p53 impinges upon ERβ function in TNBC, with the prediction
that specific p53 mutation will determine its role in the ERβ-mutant p53-p73 signaling axis impacting multiple
aspects of tumor progression and metastasis. The hypothesis is that ERβ binds to and inhibits both WTp53 and
mutant p53, leading to opposite effects on progression and therapeutic response of TNBC to agents such as
Tamoxifen (Tam). The rationale for the proposed research is that understanding how ERβ elicits opposite
functions in a p53 status-dependent manner will be critical to stratify TNBC patients to repurpose established
therapeutic agents such as Tam to treat large percentage of TNBC patients. The specific aims are: (1 Determine
the interaction of different p53 mutants with p73 and ERβ in TNBC cells; (2) Analyze the differential effects of
p53 mutants on tumor progression, metastasis and therapeutic response in vivo; and (3) Evaluate the clinical
significance of the ERβ-p53-p73 signaling axis. In specific aim 1, Isogenic TNBC cells expressing different
combinations of ERβ and WT and p53 mutants generated using CRISPR technology and shRNA-mediated
conditional knockdown will be used for analyzing the mechanisms underlying the interaction and its impact on
cellular functions in vitro and tumor progression in vivo. In specific aim 2, the effect of different p53 mutations on
tumor growth and metastasis will be analyzed in vivo. The clinical relevance of these studies will be evaluated
using well-characterized patient derived xenografts (PDXs); patient tumor-derived organoids (PDOs); and patient
tumor tissues with linked clinical database (specific aim 3). The contribution of this research is expected to be
better understanding of the mechanisms by which ERβ-p53-p73 axis in the context of different p53 mutations
affects the disease progression and therapeutic response. The proposal is innovative because analyzing the
differential effects of different p53 mutations as part of an integrated ERβ-mutant p53-p73 signaling axis is a
departure from the status quo and has the potential of developing novel therapeutic strategies against TNBC.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Durable outcomes in subsets of solid cancer patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) or adoptive
cell transfer (ACT) immunotherapy has driven interest in gaining a better understanding of resistance
mechanisms that could identify novel druggable targets. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) have
emerged as one such barrier based on their ability to inhibit innate and adaptive immunity. While elevated blood
MDSC are recognized as a poor prognostic indicator in cancer patients, it is widely thought that the main effector
site for MDSC is within the tumor microenvironment (TME). This is in line with the well-documented contact-
dependent mechanisms involving short-lived intermediates that underlie known mechanisms of T cell
suppression by MDSC. Our published and preliminary studies enlarge on this view, showing that MDSC also
function outside the TME through an unprecedented mechanism of intravascular immune suppression. The
proposed study builds on our discovery that circulating MDSC initiate contact-dependent cleavage of the L-
selectin homing receptor on target T cells that substantially reduces antigen-driven expansion of cytotoxic T cells
in lymph nodes. We further found that L-selectin loss coincides with the formation of stable MDSC clusters in the
blood of murine tumor models and advanced cancer patients. We term these new structures circulating myeloid
cell (CMC) clusters. These observations led us to hypothesize that CMC clusters are an unrecognized functional
niche for systemic immune suppression in cancer. To test this hypothesis, we will first determine if blood-borne
MDSC target not only naïve T cells, but more broadly attack stem cell memory and central memory T cells and
natural killer cells that each require L-selectin for their antitumor activity. Secondly, we will determine if CMC
clusters are the active site of L-selectin cleavage by using a multipronged genetic approach to examine L-selectin
fate following disruption of MDSC-T cell conjugate formation in vivo. These mechanistic studies center on β2
integrins that are highly expressed by MDSC but are normally inactive on leukocytes in fast-flowing blood under
non-pathological conditions. Thirdly, we will examine the translational relevance of CMC clusters during ICI or
ACT therapy in a preclinical model in which blood is the primary effector site for MDSC due to their exclusion
from the TME (by blocking chemokine-directed trafficking) and spleen (by splenectomy). We will deplete
circulating MDSC in this model using antibodies or a clinically relevant liver-X-receptor agonist that induces
MDSC-intrinsic apoptosis to establish if blood-borne MDSC contribute to therapeutic resistance. Complementary
studies will test the hypothesis that combining the analysis of circulating MDSC with CMC clusters and/or T cell
L-selectin will formulate an immunosuppressive signature that predicts response to first-line therapy in metastatic
cancer patients. The proposed studies will provide new insights into an unprecedented function of circulating
myeloid cells and could lead to the consideration of CMC clusters as a functional biomarker for prognostication
or preselection of patients that would benefit from MDSC-depleting regimens during cancer immunotherapy.

determinants of the response to endocrine therapy as well as targeted therapies that are frequently employed
in the treatment of ER+ metastatic breast cancer. Here we will focus on the RB-tumor suppressor pathway as
a central node controlling proliferation downstream of multiple pathways of relevance to therapy of ER+ breast
cancer (e.g. endocrine therapy and CDK4/6 inhibitors). While RB is required for the effective cytostatic
response to a range of targeted therapies employed in ER+ breast cancer, multiple pathways can contribute to
“cell cycle plasticity” and therefore represent distinct means for generating therapeutic resistance. Here we will
delineate the processes underlying this form of resistance, means to elicit durable cell cycle arrest, and
approaches to target resistance as observed clinically (Aim 1). Our data and newly published studies indicate
that RB loss occurs in ER+ breast cancer as a means to escape from cytostatic therapies. Analysis of the RB
locus in ER+ breast cancer indicates loss of one copy of 13q occurs in a significant fraction of ER+ breast
cancers, suggesting that such tumors are primed for RB loss. How to subsequently treat tumors that are
heterogeneous for RB or are solely RB deficient represents a significant challenge. Using drug screening and
organoid approaches we have defined several regimens that are particularly effective against RB-negative
tumors and could represent a general means to target ER+ tumors that progress on CDK4/6 inhibitors (Aim 2).
Together these aims will interrogate means to further leverage the RB tumor suppressor for a precision
approach to the treatment of ER+ breast cancer.

Head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) are aggressive neoplasms that result in debilitating
changes in speech, appearance, and quality of life in humans. Response rates in HNSCC patients have
remained relatively unchanged over the years, especially in patients with human papillomavirus (HPV)
negative HNSCC highlighting the critical need for novel strategies to meet the therapeutic needs of this patient
population. As recognized by PAR-17-245, a critical step in discovering novel therapies for HNSCC patients is
the development of tumor models that can reliably recapitulate human disease biology, heterogeneity and
therapeutic response. The overall goal of this application is to validate and credential a panel of patient-
derived and immunocompetent models of HNSCC. Systematic and in-depth comparison of histopathologic,
genomic, and therapeutic response profiles will be performed across multiple preclinical platforms in vitro
(organoids) and in vivo (allografts/xenografts). Paired in vitro and in vivo models across these platforms will be
used to assess their response to standard of care chemoradiation and immune checkpoint blockade. The
models will also be used to screen the activity of novel and FDA-approved agents (‘drug repurposing’)
targeting critical pathways implicated in the pathogenesis of HNSCC. The application builds on an existing
collaboration between several investigators at Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center with extensive
experience and expertise in mammalian models, head and neck cancer, cancer imaging, tumor immunology,
genomics, bioinformatics and cancer therapeutics. The project will employ innovative multimodal functional
imaging methods to better define and enhance the true translational utility of mammalian models. The proposal
will establish a robust panel of credentialed mammalian models of HNSCC and enable development of an
integrated preclinical pipeline to assess efficacy of novel therapeutics, identify resistance mechanisms and
enable biomarker discovery in HNSCC.

This proposal describes a 5-year research career development program focused on a non-canonical role of RB1
loss in bladder cancer. Dr. Qiang Li is an Assistant Professor of Oncology at Roswell Park Comprehensive
Cancer Center in the Department of Urology. The proposal builds on the candidate’s previous experience and
current research projects using genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) and organoids. The proposed
experiments and training will enable his transition to independence as a physician scientist in bladder cancer
translational research. He will be mentored primarily by Dr. David Goodrich. Dr. Goodrich is an expert in RB1
cancer biology, genetically engineered mouse models, acquired drug resistance and cancer cell plasticity. The
training plan includes the following goals: (1) Enhance expertise in preclinical cancer modeling (GEMM and
organoids); (2) Probe the molecular mechanisms of bladder cancer cellular plasticity and drug resistance; and
(3) Gain expertise in bioinformatic analysis.
RB1 mutations are predictive of pathologic response after neoadjuvant chemotherapy in bladder cancer. Other
clinical observations suggest that the basal type of bladder cancer is more likely to respond to chemotherapy
than the luminal type. However, the biological impact of RB1 loss on molecular subtypes of bladder cancer
pathogenesis and chemotherapy response has not been investigated. Newly discovered features of the RB1
pathway in other cancer types suggest that RB1 loss promotes lineage plasticity and acquired therapy
resistance. Thus, we hypothesize that RB1 loss promotes bladder cancer progression, metastasis, and cellular
plasticity (luminal to basal, and therapeutic resistance). We use two transgenic mouse systems (Uroplakin II
driven reverse tetracycline trans-activator, TRE-Cre) to investigate the role of RB1 loss in bladder urothelium by
facilitating deletion of tumor suppressor genes (Trp53, Pten, Rb1) under control of doxycycline administration.
We engineered doxycycline inducible triple knockout mice Trp53-/-: Pten-/-: Rb1-/- (referred as TKO) and double
knockout mice Trp53-/-: Pten-/- (referred as DKO). We propose the following Specific Aims: (1) Define the function
of RB1 loss in accelerating tumor progression, metastasis, and cellular plasticity in bladder cancer GEMMs; (2)
Dissect the impact of cell-of-origin on bladder tumorigenesis, metastasis and response to chemotherapy in TKO
tumors derived from basal cells versus luminal cells. Successful completion of this proposal will allow the
candidate to gain valuable technical knowledge and expertise in preclinical modeling of advanced bladder cancer
and further his development as an independent physician scientist. The work will also establish experimental
models and analysis pipelines that will provide the foundation for the candidate’s independent research program.

While several innovative and creative immuno-oncology (IO) strategies have shown promising results, a
significant expansion of their clinical use will require collaborative efforts to elucidate the resistance mechanism,
discover new immune targets, identify predictive biomarkers, evaluate combination therapies, and develop
preventive approaches. Utilizing a multi-disciplinary team approach, we will support Immuno-Oncology
Translation Network (IOTN)-funded components to discover new immune targets and evaluate novel immune-
based therapies and combination approaches that eliminate established cancers in adults or to prevent
cancers before they occur. Our DMRC strategy is to serve as an administrative and analytic hub at every step
of the IOTN’s translational studies, focusing to reduce the barrier for access to analytic expertise, improve the
productivity of IOTN investigators, maintain a high standard for data collection and management, design and
perform rigorous analytical strategies, and foster a collaborative and supportive research community.
An experienced, multidisciplinary team has been assembled to pursue four specific aims: First, we will provide
a centralized administration infrastructure to coordinate IOTN activities, building upon the NRG Oncology
Statistical and Data Coordinating Center’s experience of coordinating over 450 translational cancer studies
across hundreds of participating sites. Second, we will provide multidisciplinary analytic expertise to support
IOTN collaborative research, leveraging five of RPCI CCSG’s shared resources: Biostatistics, Bioinformatics,
Biomedical Data Science, Data Bank and BioRepository, and Immune Analysis. Our analytic support will be
armed with professional IT staff and informed by an experienced IO researcher team. Third, we will develop
innovative data integration methods to enhance IOTN research capacity, capitalizing on the well-respected
Bioconductor project and the independent research programs of the RPCI department of Biostatistics and
Bioinformatics. Fourth, we will actively promote the IOTN and engage in trans-consortium interactions, where
we will leverage Bioconductor’s decade-long experience in community engagement and the NRG data center’s
rich expertise in project coordination. Leveraging our active NCI-funded RPCI-committed resource to support
the proposed multi-institutional trans-disciplinary IO research is not only cost-effective, but also flexible in its
study-dependent scalability. Taken together, we envision that our DMRC, in close collaboration with the IOTN,
will allow us to conduct highly effective and innovative translational studies to address the significantly unmet
clinical needs related to IO.

Over half of children do not adhere to prescribed medications, and non-adherence is the leading cause of
treatment failure in pediatrics. Non-adherence can lead to worsening illness, death, preventable hospitalization,
increased health care cost, and morbidity. Even in pediatric cancer, when the consequences of non-adherence
to chemotherapy are potentially life threatening, over 40% of patients have clinically significant non-adherence.
For the most common pediatric cancer, Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL), children who miss just 10% of
chemotherapy doses have a nearly 4-fold risk of cancer relapse. Despite decades of research we do not have
effective strategies to meaningfully increase pediatric medication adherence. The goal of the proposed
research is to reduce preventable pediatric morbidity and mortality through testing a novel target – behavioral
parenting skills – as a modifiable mechanism to improve medication adherence in young children (ages 3-9).
Based upon our preliminary data we have begun to develop CareMeds, a parenting skills-focused adherence
intervention. The goal of this project is to use stages 0 and 1 of the NIH Stage Model to further develop and
evaluate the feasibility of the CareMeds intervention. Evidence is converging on family functioning and
parenting style as critical factors that shape child medication adherence. Yet, previous studies typically rely on
one-time global measures, making it difficult to discern the precise parenting skills that improve medication
adherence. For example, we know very little about what exactly “supportive” or “cohesive” families are doing to
promote medication adherence. In Aim 1 we will use direct observation of medication administration at home to
understand common episode-level barriers and identify the behavioral parenting skills that are most successful
in achieving medication administration in young children. In Aim 2 we will use daily diary data collection to
examine how daily parenting experiences influence the risk of medication non-adherence. We will use data
from Aims 1 and 2 and input from diverse parents to refine the final CareMeds intervention package. In Aim 3
we will conduct a pilot RCT of the intervention versus usual care with 100 families of young children ages 3-9
with ALL within 1 month of initiation of oral chemotherapy prescription. Findings from this program of research
will make significant conceptual contributions through providing nuanced understanding of the aspects of
parenting at the episode and daily levels that shape medication adherence in young children. It will make
innovative methodological advances through use of direct observation of medication administration, daily diary
data on transient parenting experiences, and rigorous measurement of adherence through objective behavioral
measures (electronic pill bottle monitoring) and pharmacological measures (validated biomarkers of drug
metabolites). Finally, it will have significant translational impact through setting the stage for a full-scale, multi-
center, RCT to examine the efficacy of the CareMeds intervention.

determinants of the response to endocrine therapy as well as targeted therapies that are frequently employed
in the treatment of ER+ metastatic breast cancer. Here we will focus on the RB-tumor suppressor pathway as
a central node controlling proliferation downstream of multiple pathways of relevance to therapy of ER+ breast
cancer (e.g. endocrine therapy and CDK4/6 inhibitors). While RB is required for the effective cytostatic
response to a range of targeted therapies employed in ER+ breast cancer, multiple pathways can contribute to
“cell cycle plasticity” and therefore represent distinct means for generating therapeutic resistance. Here we will
delineate the processes underlying this form of resistance, means to elicit durable cell cycle arrest, and
approaches to target resistance as observed clinically (Aim 1). Our data and newly published studies indicate
that RB loss occurs in ER+ breast cancer as a means to escape from cytostatic therapies. Analysis of the RB
locus in ER+ breast cancer indicates loss of one copy of 13q occurs in a significant fraction of ER+ breast
cancers, suggesting that such tumors are primed for RB loss. How to subsequently treat tumors that are
heterogeneous for RB or are solely RB deficient represents a significant challenge. Using drug screening and
organoid approaches we have defined several regimens that are particularly effective against RB-negative
tumors and could represent a general means to target ER+ tumors that progress on CDK4/6 inhibitors (Aim 2).
Together these aims will interrogate means to further leverage the RB tumor suppressor for a precision
approach to the treatment of ER+ breast cancer.

metabolic enzymes. It is quite evident from current literature that many of the mitochondrial enzymes are
localized to the nucleus, more so in diseased conditions such as cancer. However, there is a significant gap in
knowledge about their spatial distribution in the nucleus and biological function. We believe nuclear localization
of mitochondrial metabolic enzymes is not random, and there is specific necessity coupled to critical biological
functions that regulate this process. In this study we wish to perform a comprehensive functional
characterization deciphering the spatial and temporal role of mitochondrial enzymes in the nucleus. Our
preliminary findings identified Kreb’s cycle enzymes such as aconitase (ACO2), α-keto glutarate (AKG), and
citrate synthase (CS); and glycolytic enzymes such as pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) and ATP-citrate lyase
are enriched in the nucleus of cancer cells. We hypothesize these mitochondrial enzymes form complex in the
nucleus based which is yet to be characterized. We hypothesize that they function as a large-multi enzyme
complex which is recruited to chromatin by transcription factors and coregulators to sustain metabolic stress
encountered during gene transcription. Using metabolomics, proteomics, chromatin immunoprecipitation and
gene expression analysis, we envision detailing the sequential events driving their recruitment by nuclear
factors on chromatin, and their role in reprogramming transcription machinery to drive aggressive cancer. This
is a novel concept supported by isolated reports from various groups, yet remains relatively unexplored and a
comprehensive mechanistic study is lacking. We envision findings from our study will have a major impact on
broad important problems in biomedical research including metabolic disorders and cancer.

Given the high mortality of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) as a result of relapse after androgen
deprivation therapy (ADT), novel treatment strategies are urgently needed. Tumor suppressor gene-
phosphatase and tensin homolog (
PTEN) is mutated in approximately 20% of primary prostate cancers, and in
as many as 40~60% of CRPC. In addition to activation of PI3K oncogenic signaling pathway, loss of PTEN is
also associated with cytokine and chemokine signaling that creates an immunosuppressive microenvironment.
Both defects in antigen presentation in tumor cells and the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME)
have been implicated in CRPC progression after ADT and therapeutic resistance in prostate cancer in the clinic.
Genetic or pharmacologic inactivation of β isoform of PI3K (p110β) in PTEN-deficient prostate cancer has been
reported to significantly inhibit tumor growth and progression. Ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related (ATR)
exhibits essential functions in controlling DNA replication stress and DNA damage response in cancer cells.
PTEN-deficient cells have been reported to be more sensitive to ATR inhibition. PI3Kβ is also functionally
associated with DNA damage response and genomic integrity in tumor growth. By using a syngeneic genetically
engineered mouse model of CRPC driven by co-deletion of PTEN and TP53 (PP-CRPC), we found that addition
of p110β inhibitor significantly reduces the viability of ATR inhibitor-treated PP-CRPC cells. Moreover, our
preliminary data show that inhibition of p110β or ATR alone significantly increases MHC class I antigen
presentation in mouse or human CRPC cells. Based on these novel preliminary data, we hypothesize that p110β
inhibitor in combination with ATR inhibitor will show promising anti-tumor activity in PTEN-deficient CRPC via
inducing cell death in cancer cells and anti-tumor immunity in the tumor microenvironment. We also hypothesize
that inhibition of p110β will increase DNA replication stress and sensitize PTEN-deficient CRPC cells to ATR
inhibition. In this study, we will
1)
evaluate the therapeutic efficacy and antitumor immune responses of combined
ATR inhibition and p110β
inhibition i
n syngeneic PTEN-deficient CRPC mouse models; 2) investigate the
molecular mechanisms of the combined effect of ATR inhibitor and p110β
inhibitor in replication stress and DNA
damage-induced cell death in PTEN-deficient CRPC cells.
Our study will not only provide fundamental
information for translational research of p110β inhibitors and ATR inhibitors in cancer treatment, but also provide
a novel treatment strategy for patients with PTEN-deficient advanced CRPC.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：A developing body of preclinical evidence suggests that the integrity and composition of the tumor immune
microenvironment (TIME) is highly plastic and is modulated by host lifestyle exposures. Unhealthful exposures
including obesity, inactivity and a high fat diet can lead to a loss of CD8+ T cell effector function and tumor
progression in preclinical breast tumor models, while healthful exposures, such as voluntary wheel running, can
offset tumor growth and dysregulated conditions in the TIME leading to increased trafficking and enhanced func-
tion of CD8+ T cells. Although emerging pre-clinical evidence is compelling, several gaps in epidemiological
knowledge regarding the link among lifestyle factors, tumor immunity and BC outcomes remain.
 First, despite a suggestion to adhere to The American Institute for Cancer Research (AICR) and The Ameri-
can Cancer Society (ACS) cancer prevention lifestyle guidelines after a cancer diagnosis, which lifestyle factors
and whether they work together to impact BC outcomes has not been well established. Second, research on the
role of lifestyles and immunity in BC patients has primarily focused on immune cell subsets in the circulating
peripheral blood. To our knowledge, whether lifestyles are associated with distinct immune cell phenotypes in
the breast TIME, the site most relevant for treatment response and BC prognosis, has remained uninvestigated.
 Building off the extant preclinical evidence and multiple lines of published and preliminary evidence from our
group, we designed the current study to address these critical gaps in knowledge. Leveraging data from 1160
primary invasive BC patients enrolled in the Data Bank and BioRepository (DBBR) at Roswell Park, we devel-
oped a composite lifestyle index score (LIS) reflecting adherence to seven cancer prevention recommendations
from The AICR and The ACS including: 1) maintaining a healthy weight; 2) being physically active; 3) eating a
variety of fruits and vegetables; 4) limiting red and processed meats; 5) limiting or avoiding sugar-sweetened
beverages; 6) limiting or avoiding alcohol consumption; and 7) avoiding smoking. Our preliminary analyses re-
veals that patients with the highest versus lowest LIS (e.g., tertiles) experience striking survival advantages.
Based on these and other preliminary data, we formulated our central hypothesis that CD8+ T cell composition
in the breast TIME mediates the observed association between the LIS and BC outcomes. To test this hypothesis,
we will link detailed lifestyle data with multispectral immunohistochemical immune profiling from 1160 BC patients
enrolled in DBBR with available FFPE tumor tissue to execute formal mediation pathway analyses via three
Specific Aims. In aim 1, we will define associations of the LIS with CD8+ T cell composition in the breast TIME
(cell densities, ratios and clusters of total CD8+ T cells, exhausted CD8+ T cells and activated CD8+ T cells).
Next, in aim 2, we will identify associations of CD8+ T cell composition in the breast TIME with BC outcomes. In
aim 3, we will delineate the contributions of CD8+ T cells in the TIME as biological intermediaries underlying the
observed association between the LIS and BC outcomes.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：ABSTRACT
Breast cancer (BC) is a complex and heterogeneous neoplastic disease with a high incidence and mortality. BC
can be divided into clinical, histopathologic, and molecular subtypes. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC)
accounts for approximately 15% of all breast cancer cases and is characterized by tumors that do not express
the estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2).
TNBC is thought to be the most aggressive subtype and is associated with a poor prognosis, as well as a high
risk of distant recurrence and death within the first 3–5 years of follow-up. The absence of these receptors
renders TNBC resistant to treatments targeting those pathways. Thus, TNBC still remains a neoplastic disease
with unmet clinical challenges. Our laboratory has previously demonstrated an integral tumor-intrinsic role of
TAZ (transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif; also known as WWTR1), which is a key component of
the Hippo signaling pathway found in TNBC progression/metastasis. New preliminary data in our laboratory
indicate that tumor TAZ expression inhibits tumor progression in mouse models of TNBC cells in immune system
intact mice, thus indicating that TAZ expression also plays an underappreciated extrinsic role in TNBC biology.
We further revealed that TAZ regulates the recruitment and/or function of immune suppressive cells, such as
myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), macrophages and regulatory T cells (Tregs). The overall objective
of this proposal is to understand the underlying molecular mechanisms by which TAZ expression in tumor cells
regulates immune suppressive cells in TNBC. Our central hypothesis is that tumor TAZ expression regulates the
TME landscape via cross-talk between cancer cells with non-cancer immune suppressive cells. Our long-term
goal is to decipher TAZ regulated crosstalk between breast tumor cells and the immune components within the
tumor microenvironment (TME) to uncover new prognostic or therapeutic targets for TNBC. To achieve these
goals, we propose the following two aims: 1) To determine the impact of tumor-intrinsic TAZ expression on the
immune-TME; and 2) To understand the molecular mechanisms of TAZ expression driven immune suppressive
cells recruitment in TME. A major impact of this study is to identify previously undescribed TAZ-mediated
mechanisms that will unveil new biomarkers or inform novel therapeutic interventions for advanced TNBC.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Summary
Patients with extrabronchial tumors that induce malignant central airway obstruction (MCAO) face significant
morbidity and only 1-7 months median overall survival. An estimated 20-30% of patients with lung cancer will
have MCAO during the course of their disease, but other malignancies that metastasize to the airway can induce
central airway obstruction. We have recently reported, in a Phase I study, that Photofrin® mediated image-
guided interstitial photodynamic therapy (I-PDT) with our novel treatment planning and light dosimetry platform
is safe, with promising outcomes. Three out of 10 treated patients are alive at 26.5, 12 and 8.3 months. Our
image-based treatment planning was used to guide the administration of the light dose rate (irradiance) and light
dose (fluence) to the target tumor while sparing adjacent normal tissue.
Our goal is to improve the rate of complete and partial tumor response of extrabronchial MCAO to I-PDT. To that
end we propose to increase tumor blood oxygenation that will increase laser light transmission and oxygen
supply known to improve the efficacy of PDT. Murine studies reported that palliative x-ray radiotherapy (p-XRT)
can increase tumor oxygenation and alter vasculature. We therefore explore the use of p-XRT to improve tumor
response to I-PDT. Our preliminary data demonstrate that p-XRT followed by I-PDT (p-XRT/I-PDT) significantly
increases (p<0.05) complete response of locally advanced mouse tumors, in comparison to either I-PDT or p-
XRT. Under compassionate care exemption we showed that I-PDT delivered 48 ± 4h after 8Gy x1 p-XRT can
provide control of extrabronchial MCAO in two patients. There are no effective treatments for extrabronchial
MCAO. Thus, the overriding significance of our proposal is its responsiveness to an unmet clinical need.
We hypothesize that standard of care p-XRT (8Gy x1) followed by I-PDT is safe and will improve treatment
outcomes in patients with extrabronchial MCAO, and that this improvement is due to changes in the
tumor microenvironment. To test our hypothesis, we propose to accomplish the following aims.
Aim 1. To conduct a Phase I/II study to test the safety and efficacy of p-XRT followed by I-PDT in patients
with extrabronchial MCAO. We define success as demonstrating that this treatment is safe and result in ≥50%
of participants having partial or complete tumor response and/or significant improvement in quality of life and
physical performance at 3 months post treatment. We will

evaluate the relationship of changes in light
Aim 2. To define the mechanisms by which p-XRT improves tumor response to I-PDT in mouse models.
We will define how changes in tumor microenvironment impact light transmission and tumor response, as well
as the contribution of anti-tumor immunity to tumor control and tumor-free survival.
These data will inform the design of a future randomized Phase II trial of p-XRT/I-PDT versus standard of care.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Abstract. DNA-targeting drugs are a mainstream therapy for cancer, but it is becoming clearer that some of their
anti-cancer activity is due not only to DNA damage, but also chromatin decondensation, which we call chromatin
damage (CD). Moreover, it has been shown that some drugs cause only CD without DNA damage, and these
"CD-only" drugs are as potent anti-cancer drugs as compounds causing both CD and DNA damage, but lack the
toxicity associated with DNA damage. The focus of our study is to understand how CD activates IFN, and how
this property can be used in the clinic to gauge the potency of CD drugs. Our ultimate goal of our research is to
show that CD is a superior mechanism to DNA damage for the next generation of anti-cancer chemotherapy,
which is more effective, less toxic, and more powerful in activating an anti-tumor immune response.
 To achieve this goal, we have developed a new group of "CD-only" chemicals, curaxins. The anti-cancer
activity of curaxin clinical lead, CBL0137, has been demonstrated in multiple mouse models. Phase I trial has
shown manageable toxicities and evidence of antitumor activity. These studies confirmed induction of IFN
signaling by CBL0137 in mice and humans. Notably, curaxins cause stronger and faster IFN induction than DNA
damaging agents, DNA methyltransferase inhibitors, and HDAC inhibitors. It is well established now that IFN
induction significantly improves their anti-cancer efficacy of DNA damaging therapy. CD causes IFN induction
via different mechanisms, but our data showed that IFN activation enhances anti-cancer efficacy of CD.
 Therefore, we propose that anti-cancer activity of CD agents is mediated in vivo via two complementary
mechanisms: direct killing of tumor cells and engagement of anti-tumor immune attack. This proposal focuses
on the hypothesis that IFN signaling in tumor and/or non-tumor cells is induced by CD via a mechanism different
from DNA damage and potentiates the anti-cancer activity of CD drugs.
 We will focus on triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), a challenging disease to treat due to its aggressive
behavior and lack of actionable targets. Our specific aims are: 1. Determine the impact of the IFN activation
in tumor and non-tumor cells on the anti-tumor activity of CD therapy. 2. Define the mechanisms of IFN
activation by CD agents. 3. Develop strategies for reversing the immune suppressive environment in
triple-negative breast cancer using CD agents.

Novel deep learning frameworks for predicting nucleosome-binding proteins
Nucleosome-binding proteins (NBPs) such as pioneer transcription factors play an important role in cell fate
changes during organogenesis, cell differentiation, and reprogramming. The ability of nucleosome binding is
encoded within their DNA-binding domains. However, experimental identification of the NBPs is expensive and
time-consuming with low sensitivity. The proposed research aims to develop novel deep learning frameworks to
predict the NBPs. In Aim 1, we will develop a novel two-stage transfer learning framework. In the first stage, the
knowledge of the protein language model ProtT5 will be extracted as feature embeddings to represent the amino
acid sequences of the proteins. The information from the 1-D sequences will be combined with that from their 3-
D structures, which will be processed by a state-of-the-art Graph Neural Network (GNN) for 3-D molecules. In
the second stage, the GNN model will be first initialized by annotated DNA-binding proteins (DBPs) and then
fine-tuned on a NBP dataset. In Aim 2, we will design and implement a novel transfer learning-continual learning
framework to predict the NBPs in a species-specific manner. The transfer learning module initializes a novel
Bayesian online inference model with the knowledge acquired from the DBP prediction model of Aim 1 through
a prior for generative probabilistic neural networks. The continual learning module based on probabilistic
inferences will be able to constantly update learned neural network parameters with the DBPs of a given species
without forgetting the previously acquired knowledge. Lastly, the trained DBP prediction model will be fine-tuned
to make predictions of species-specific NBPs. Overall, this proof-of-concept study aims to gain technical
knowledge on the proposed frameworks and evaluate their feasibility for predicting the nucleosome binders.
These frameworks, if successful, will have a potential to broadly advance biomedical research by being
generalized to other types of intermolecular interactions, e.g., protein-RNA interactions and protein-protein
interactions.

will include important serotypes, their impact and cost-effectiveness will likely be less than what was
achieved with introduction of PCV7, PCV10 and PCV13 because, in recent years, prevalent serotypes
causing infections have changed and continue to change. Here we propose a clinical study,
vaccinating children with a low cost-to-produce, serotype-independent, killed, non-capsulated avirulent
whole-cell Streptococcus pneumoniae (wSp) vaccine that elicits Th17 cell-mediated immunity and
antibodies against all pneumococcal serotyypes, and which has been tested in adults and toddlers.
Nasopharyngeal (NP) colonization is a prerequisite to pneumococcal diseases and transmission. We
will evaluate the efficacy of wSp vaccination in young children on pneumococcal NP colonization at
times of health and onset of acute otitis media. Notably, prevention of pneumococcal NP colonization
may be a surrogate for prevention by wSp of pneumococcal infections. In addition, we will confirm the
safety and immunogenicity of wSp. Demonstration of a reduction of NP colonization, safety,
immunogenicity of wSp would engage the scientific and public health community and
commercialization support for additional licensure studies to next test for protection against various
pneumococcal diseases, to determine whether wSp could complement PCVs or even replace PCVs
as an inexpensive, serotype-independent vaccine.

This project proposes to revolutionize image-guided surgery (IGS) technology by tracking surgical modiﬁcations
in real time. IGS has profoundly changed modern endoscopic surgical techniques by allowing surgeons to
visualize pathologies that are not visible by endoscopy, to direct surgical instruments through the patient's
anatomy. However, revcurrent IGS is a static mechanism and can neither dynamically track surgery nor update
IGS reference images by CT or MRI in real time. The reference images easily deviate from the actual anatomy
and pathology during surgery, and surgeons must rely on memory to ensure the correctness and completeness of
the resection. This is more pronounced when the surgery covers a big area or involves soft tissue. In endoscopic
sinus and skull base surgery (ESSBS), for example, the surgery involves the wide sinus and skull base area,
which is a honeycomb-shaped structure surrounded by dense blood vessels and nerves. revDriven by ensuring the
safety of the patient during the operation, there is a reluctance to avoid more eﬀective but riskier resections.
This results in a currently accepted revision rate of ESSBS of up to 28%. By real-time tracking and guiding,
the precision of surgery would be dramatically increased, leading to far greater success in surgery, with a vastly
reduced percentage of required revision surgery.
This design approach will focus on the ability to track modiﬁcation and update images in real-time through
system optimization and advanced algorithms. revThe project will use a novel deep causal learning (DCL)
framework to break the bottleneck that results from the current unpredictable adverse factors in operating
rooms. The framework will use invertible nets to learn from data and clinical knowledge and identify, isolate,
and compensate for the adverse factors, leading to a realistic solution to this problem. A research team has been
assembled including surgeons, and computer scientists, to identify the limitations and challenges to formulate
a research plan to redesign the utility of IGS information to track surgery in real-time. The team will rely on
years of previous collaboration together to verify the feasibility of motion-based modiﬁcation tracking. More
speciﬁcally, this project will use motion and endoscopic videos (Aims 1 and 2) to independently track surgical
modiﬁcations. The two methods are based on the DCL framework, and the tracking results not only have
accuracy and estimated conﬁdence but will include the impacts of adverse factors as well. Moreover, the project
will fuse the two methods and verify clinical usability in the operating room environment (Aim 3).
revThis project will achieve reliable real-time updates of IGS in real clinical environments, and directly improve
the reliability of ESSBS surgical navigation. The project will pioneer tracking of surgical modiﬁcation when both
deformation and modiﬁcation are present, and extend the application of IGS to a broader array of endoscopic
surgeries. The use of causal learning to solve the medical modeling problem will be explored, thus paving the
way for using current and prior medical knowledge to formulate critical new learning of IGS procedures.

ABSTRACT
Over the past several years, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), especially deep learning (DL),
has been the most prominent direction of tomographic research, commercial development, clinical translation,
and FDA evaluation. Recently, it has become widely recognized that deep neural networks often have
generalizability issues and are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, deliberate or unintentional. This critical
challenge must be addressed to optimize the performance of deep neural networks in medical applications.
In January this year, FDA published an action plan for furthering the oversight for AI/DL-based software as
medical devices (SaMDs). One major action underlined in the plan is “regulatory science methods related to
algorithm bias and robustness”. The significance of ensuring the safety and effectiveness of AI/DL-based
SaMDs cannot be overestimated since AI is expected to play a critical role in the future of medicine. In this
context, the overall goal of this academic-FDA partnership R01 project is to generate diverse training and
challenging testing datasets of low-dose CT (LDCT) scans, prototype a virtual CT workflow, and establish an
evaluation methodology for AI-based imaging products to support FDA marketing authorization. The technical
innovation lies in cutting-edge DL methods empowered by (a) adversarial learning to generate anatomically
and pathologically representative features in the human chest; (b) adversarial attacking to probe the virtual CT
workflow in individual steps and its entirety; and (c) systematic evaluation methods to better characterize and
predict the clinical performance of AI-based imaging products. In contrast to other CT simulation pipelines, our
Adversarially Based CT (ABC) platform relies on adversarial learning to ensure diversity and realism of the
simulated data and images and improve the generalizability of deep networks, and utilizes adversarial samples
to probe the ABC workflow to address the robustness of deep networks.
The overarching hypothesis is that adversarial learning and attacking methods are powerful to deliver high-
quality datasets for AI-based imaging research and performance evaluation. The specific aims are: (1) diverse
patient modeling (SBU), (2) virtual CT scanning (UTSW), (3) deep CT imaging (RPI), (4) virtual workflow
validation (FDA), and (5) ABC system dissemination (RPI-SBU-UTSW-FDA). In this project, generative
adversarial learning will play an instrumental role in generating features of clinical semantics. Also, adversarial
samples will be produced in both sinogram and image domains. In these complementary ways, AI-based
imaging products can be efficiently evaluated for not only accuracy but also generalizability and robustness.
Upon completion, our ABC workflow/platform will be made publicly available and readily extendable to other
imaging modalities and other diseases. This ABC system will be shared through the FDA’s Catalog of
Regulatory Science Tools, and uniquely well positioned to greatly facilitate the development, assessment and
translation of emerging AI-based imaging products.

 Bone fractures, due to aging and disease, contribute significantly to healthcare cost
affecting the quality of life of 32.6 million adults in the US. Clinically, fracture risk can be
predicted by dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) or the fracture risk assessment (FRAX) tool.
Because type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients exhibit high bone mineral density, both of these tools
fail to correctly predict fracture risk, leading to a significant increase of fragility fractures in
diabetic subjects. Therefore, there is a need to investigate how modifications in collagen and
other organic components in bone can forecast diabetic fractures. Pentosidine (PEN), a
fluorescent Advanced Glycation Endproduct (AGE) that forms in bone by reaction between
sugars and proteins, is the only established marker of bone fragility. However, it does not
consistently predict T2D and fragility fractures. Here, for the first time in bone, we demonstrate
the formation of carboxymethyl-lysine (CML), a non-fluorescent AGE associated with
glycoxidative damage and hyperglycemia. We further show that it forms in abundance in bone
and is highly correlated to loss of bone toughness. Preliminary data presented in the proposal
demonstrate that, in contrast to other AGEs, CML is upregulated >60% in T2D human bone
compared to their age-matched controls. We then provide evidence that CML promotes
formation and growth of additional hydroxyapatite (HA) crystals, similar to human T2D condition,
and forms a ‘molecular link’ between the organic and inorganic components of bone (collagen-
HA interface) impairing bone quality. CML could therefore be a ‘new and relevant’ biomarker
of T2D fracture that captures the effects of hyperglycemia and oxidative stress in bone
and explains why diabetic bone is susceptible to fracture during overt T2D. Using an
obese and a non-obese mouse model of T2D, that mimic both causality and impact of human
T2D on bone, we provide evidence that T2D increases AGEs, with CML explaining bone
fragility. Similarly, we show that higher serum CML levels are associated with increased risk of
incident clinical and prevalent vertebral fractures in T2D, independent of BMD. Thus, our overall
goal is to establish CML as a new and relevant biomarker of bone fragility and determine how it
contributes to bone fragility in T2D. Using a combination of in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo models
we will pursue the following three aims: Aim 1: Evaluate CML as a putative new biomarker of
bone fragility and determine the mechanism(s) by which it reduces energy dissipation in bone;
Aim 2: Determine the contribution of CML and other AGEs to alterations in bone matrix and
energy dissipation in human T2D vertebrae and cortical and cancellous bone from hip fracture
patients.; Aim 3: Validate CML as a biomarker of T2D bone fragility using obese and non-obese
mouse models of T2D and data from the Health, Aging and Body Composition (ABC) study. Our
findings will provide a new understanding of the mechanism and the effects of CML and other
AGEs on bone fractures leading to new strategies to predict, manage and mitigate T2D and
fragility fractures.

Regulation currently relies heavily on machine-generated emissions to predict harmful and potentially harmful
constituent (HPHC) exposure from using products under review, without a good understanding of how the
product will impact public health under real-world conditions. This study addresses the question of whether
ecig users who currently choose to use lower nicotine eliquids are actually consuming less nicotine compared
to those who choose to use higher nicotine eliquids. We will provide evidence on the extent to which using low
nicotine eliquids reduces one’s overall exposure to HPHC. We will monitor N=120 pod and pen-style regular
ecig users in their natural environment for one week, collecting ambulatory topography data using RIT’s
wPUMTM monitors along with daily salivary cotinine, subject effects and exposure and health effect biomarkers.
Data will be evaluated in the context of the joint effect of product characteristics and behavior on product
emissions and, ultimately, on public health. Aim 1: Evaluate HPHC exposure using the traditional approach of
salivary cotinine, a well-accepted biomarker for nicotine exposure, and other urinary and salivary biomarkers of
exposure and adverse health affect. Aim 2: Evaluate HPHC exposure using a novel alternative outcome
measure we call behavior-based yield, which incorporates one-week of intensive puff-by-puff topography and
product-specific emissions, Aim 3: Add pharmacokinetics to improve the predictive utility of the behavior-
based yield model by incorporating personalized reaction kinetics, which will then be applied to predict the
time-course of salivary cotinine for one-week of natural use. We expect the outcomes to support the
premise that exposure to both nicotine and total particulate matter are important in risk assessment,
and the potential to inadvertently increase one by decreasing the other must be considered when
making product choices and regulatory decisions. This project will; (1) Provide evidence that regulating
nicotine concentration alone does not reduce nicotine uptake, nor reduce adverse health effect; (2) Provide
device-independent evidence that users of lower nicotine eliquids do not consume less nicotine and may
consumer more total particulate matter compared to users of higher nicotine eliquids; (3) Provide evidence
supporting the need for rigorous accounting of behavior when reporting HPHC exposure in PMTA and MRTP
applications; and (4) Provide evidence in support of establishing a causal relationship between tobacco
product characteristics and health effect.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Cerebral cortical development is a highly orchestrated process, with production of neurons destined for the cortical layers produced in order, deep to superficial, followed by glial generation. The timing of this process is very different between species. For example, mouse corticogenesis occurs over approximately a week of gestation, while in humans the process takes several months, resulting in a much larger and more complex cortex. Lineage studies have functionally defined the major types of neural progenitor cells (NPCs) contributing to corticogenesis, including stem cell-like radial glial cells (RGCs) and intermediate progenitor cells (IPCs). However, much remains to be discovered regarding how RGCs and IPCs are specified over time. We have discovered that during asymmetric RGC-IPC cell divisions, the RNA binding protein Stau2 segregates a complex cargo of coding and non-coding RNA specifically into the IPC daughter. Analysis of this cargo at different embryonic stages by RNA-sequencing has revealed networks of genes that are candidates for controlling proliferation and temporal specification of the IPC fate. Here we propose to test these candidates in functional studies, using high-throughput automated time-lapse image analysis for in vitro studies, as well as a novel lentiviral in vivo screening method, to define their roles in specifying IPCs and timing corticogenesis. In contrast to the progress made in understanding the characteristics of mouse cortical progenitor cells, less is understood regarding human cortical progenitors. Fundamental knowledge about how human RGCs and IPCs produce diverse progeny over time, their division mode, cell cycle times and lineages, remains unknown. Here we will address these gaps in knowledge using long-term time-lapse lineage analysis in vitro. In addition, by identifying genes expressed in human cortical progenitor cells, including at the single cell level and via analysis of the Stau2 cargo, we will reveal human cortical progenitor subtypes and heterogeneity. Further, a comparison of human and mouse cortical progenitor cell data will help illuminate key differences to address a major mystery: the difference in timing of mouse and human cortical development. Our lab continues to explore the interaction of environmental factors on cortical progenitor cells, aided by the ability to rapidly quantify changes in proliferation, division mode and differentiation using time-lapse analysis. Soluble factors released by structures in the germinal niche such as vascular endothelial cells and the choroid plexus, act on cortical progenitors to regulate the numbers and types of progeny they produce. Our recent work has identified a panel of candidate niche molecules secreted by the choroid plexus that could interact with receptors expressed on neural progenitors, which we propose to examine in vitro and in vivo, in mouse and human. Defining niche factors and their specific actions paves the way to address diseases that involve degeneration of stem cell zones which are normally active throughout life. Furthermore, defining environmental factors that act on human NPCs is important for translation towards regenerative therapy development.

Decades of study have demonstrated that adult human retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells have strong
proliferative capacity in vitro, which indicates that the RPE layer has the possibility of self-repair. We have shown
that adult RPE from elderly donors or donors with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) can proliferate in
culture and produce a near-native, renewed RPE monolayer. Despite this, RPE cells in vivo do not regenerate
the damaged cobblestone RPE layer in patients with degenerating cells, such as those with dry AMD. The
environment in vivo must effectively prevent repair of the cobblestone RPE monolayer, either through lack of
mitogens or inhibitory molecules or a combination of both. The overarching goal of these studies is to achieve
safe, controlled proliferation of endogenous RPE cells to enable self-repair of the RPE layer in patients with
AMD. The objective of this proposal is to characterize the environmental factors that positively and negatively
control the proliferation of adult human RPE cells. The first specific aim is to characterize the adult human RPE
cell surfaceome on dividing and non-dividing cells using an innovative mass spectrometry and bioinformatic
platform. This will provide the first comprehensive analysis of the molecules on the RPE plasma membrane and
reveal cell surface receptors and secreted proteins that respond to environmental factors impacting cell division.
Investigating both normal and AMD RPE will provide a greater understanding of how RPE cells change with
disease. The second specific aim is to examine a transcriptional network we have identified that is associated
with adult human RPE cell proliferation to determine which molecules are critical. To do this efficiently, we will
first employ CRISPRi, then additional functional screens. The third specific aim will examine whether exogenous
factors can activate proliferation of quiescent, cobblestone human RPE, including those in situ on Bruch’s
membrane explants, and those from patients with AMD. In addition to the main objective, this study will generate
new knowledge about RPE molecules that can be used to target RPE in vivo. The proposed work also has the
potential to improve RPE cell proliferation ex vivo for more efficient cell manufacturing. Most importantly, this
study will create a foundation for safely stimulating RPE cell proliferation in vivo. Endogenous activation of RPE
cell proliferation to counteract RPE cell loss in AMD has the potential to avoid surgery and immunosuppression
involved in RPE cell transplantation, which would greatly benefit the elderly AMD patient population.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Abstract. Given the very limited success in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) drug development over the past decades
an extended search for therapy beyond the amyloid-b and tau hypotheses is needed. According to one promising
and underexplored hypothesis, in AD the key pathophysiological events are linked with brain insulin resistance.
This hypothesis, referred to as Type 3 Diabetes (T3D), is supported by many lines of evidence including altered
insulin pathways in AD brains and cognitive benefits of anti-diabetic drugs. The mechanisms of T3D
pathogenesis remain unknown, however. Extensive research demonstrated that suppression of different nodes
in the growth hormone (GH)/ insulin-like growth factor (IGF)/ mechanistic target of the rapamycin (mTOR)
cascade slows down aging and aging-associated cognitive decline in a range of model organisms. Insulin and
IGF hormonal cascades have a common ancestry and the two axes of hormonal signaling are not fully separated.
Their negative feedback loops overlap, so that activation of IGF-1 receptor (IGF1R) results in suppression of
insulin receptor substrate (IRS) a key node in insulin signaling. Following this evidence, we hypothesize that
chronic activation of a molecular cascade downstream of IGF1 results in a negative feedback
suppression of insulin signaling (Fig. 1) in the brain and T3D development. Additionally, IGF1R negatively
regulates autophagy and positively regulates NF-kB-mediated inflammation providing bridges between T3D,
misfolded proteins, and inflammatory mechanisms of AD and AD-related dementias (ADRD). Informed by this
hypothesis, we have conducted preliminary proof of a principle longevity experiments with mice in which small
molecule IGF1R inhibitors orally administered starting 13 months of age (~45 human years) prevented the
decline of short-term memory, prevented the development of insulin resistance, improved grip strength,
decreased frailty, and increased lifespan. Capitalizing on these results the current proposal will allow us to make
further steps toward the development of AD therapy based on IGF1R inhibition via the following aims: (1) to
optimize drug-candidate molecules via computational modeling and subsequent testing of their target affinity
and selectivity, toxicity properties, absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion characteristics; and (2) to
characterize neurodegeneration prevention by optimized molecules using two mouse models: wildtype
mice naturally developing cognitive decline with age and 3xTg-AD mouse model of AD. The ability of optimized
drugs to improve cognitive function and improve markers of insulin signaling, autophagy, inflammation, Aβ, and
tau pathology in their brains will be analyzed. This project will result in a candidate drug(s) for AD and ADRD,
targeting novel molecular mechanisms and ready for preclinical development.

Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are complex disorders manifested by qualitatively atypical social
communication skills and an aberrant behavioral repertoire that vary in severity across individuals. We lack
neurobiologically-grounded predictors of autism in the general population. Our studies seek to fill this critical
gap in our knowledge about neurobiologically-grounded quantitative signatures that precede manifestations of
ASD in toddlers recruited from the general population. We aim to (i) apply advanced computational analytic
techniques to formally chart the emergence of atypical developmental trajectories, and (ii) uncover and validate
neurobiologically-grounded, clinically meaningful subtypes predictive of future risk for atypical development,
revolutionizing brain imaging in young children. In our previous work we have discovered that head
movements during functional MRI provide an abundant source of useful movement data whose statistical
features are linked to clinical and cognitive outcomes in children and adults diagnosed with ASD. Our recent
studies have revealed that quantitative signatures of atypical learning trajectories can be detected as early as
1-2 months in infants at high familial risk for developing ASD. Atypical functioning of the sensorimotor system
has deleterious functional consequences across diverse domains of learning and development and may
contribute to ASD manifestations, in toddlers screened prospectively in the general population. Using data from
the NIH-funded National Database for Autism Research (NDAR) we will test whether atypical movement
variability during MRI scans during the 2nd year of life in N=212 toddlers from the general population is
predictive of ASD or non-ASD outcomes (vs. typical development, TD) ascertained during the 3rd year. We will
rigorously quantify key kinematic parameters during MRI scans acquired in toddlers ages 12-24 months
according to different conditions, including sleeping or resting, while language is presented to sleeping
toddlers, and also during a socially-orienting scan. We hypothesize that deleterious, context-incongruent
signatures during the 2nd year of life in toddlers will be related subsequently to greater ASD manifestations at
36-48 months. Machine learning algorithms will be used to classify ASD, non-ASD, and TD toddlers. The
overall goal of these studies is to illuminate the neurobiological basis of sensorimotor variability in toddlers from
the general population and to establish that sensorimotor signatures are part and parcel of the child’s future
ASD diagnosis, a finding which will have profound, transformative implications for neuroimaging methods in
young children. This knowledge will provide new, early mechanistic insights into the basis of such associations
recently established in children, adolescents, and adults with and without ASD, as well as in human infants,
and advance Research Priorities of the NIMH.

Nearly all modern drug discovery efforts begin with a virtual screening campaign, and there are
now several drugs available on the market that were originally identified through computational
efforts. Small molecule drug discovery, in particular, has benefited from the integration of
computational chemistry tools that have become capable of the necessary throughput due to
advances in computational power and algorithmic development. Binding free energy
calculations have enhanced the practice of small molecule lead optimization and have helped
expedite the development of effective drugs to transform the healthcare landscape.
Peptide drugs are widely considered to be a promising, yet currently underutilized, class of
drugs due to their high level of tunability with modern synthesis methods. Their large exposed
surface area relative to small molecule drugs supports an increased level of specificity and the
roughly 80 peptide drugs currently available on the market represent some of the highest
therapeutic indices of known drugs. Peptide drugs even offer the opportunity to address targets
that were previously thought to be undruggable.
Peptide drugs are situated to similarly benefit from computational lead optimization strategies,
but the application of existing tools for accelerating discovery efforts is less established than for
small molecule drugs. The barrier for achieving widespread success in computational peptide
lead optimization is two-fold: the increased size of peptide drugs makes the necessary
conformational sampling more challenging, and the diversity in chemical character among
different peptide drugs makes it difficult to fit a reliable classical simulation model. The former
challenge can be overcome through efficient conformational sampling approaches, while the
latter can be addressed by quantum mechanical calculations that avoid the need for a restrictive
fit to analytical models. Overcoming both of these challenges simultaneously requires an
innovative approach, because the solutions to each of them independently have been, until
recently, mutually exclusive.
The objective of the proposed research is to make computational lead optimization reliable for
peptide drug discovery by developing a machine learning-based peptide simulation model that
simultaneously overcomes both of the aforementioned challenges. We will achieve this by
training a machine learning potential on the basis of quantum mechanical simulation data, which
will be implemented on our QSP Life molecular simulation platform for efficiently calculating
peptide binding free energies.

Bathrooms are extremely hazardous for older adults and wheelchair users. Bathroom injuries, many related to
toileting, occur at a rate of 266.6 per100,000 among persons aged ≥85 years and result in costly, injurious falls
and numerous cascading adverse health consequences. Transfer assisting technologies are important tools that
can be used to promote wellness, independence, community participation, and quality of life. New, easy-to-use
technologies that enable more efficient and safer toilet transfers for patients and caregivers are desperately
needed. This SBIR Phase II project proposes to refine and evaluate PPAL®, an assisted toileting device that
enables persons at risk for toileting-related falls to safely transfer with less physical assistance from a caregiver.
The proposed Phase II activities will refine and test theproof-of-concept prototype developed under an NIH
Phase I project by QUA, Inc. PPAL is a patented, motorized, height adjustable bedside commode with integrated
transfer boards. PPAL incorporates a transfer board that moves up and down as the Chair seat is raised or
lowered so that the user can always perform a downhill transfer. This innovation will allow individuals with limited
mobility who currently rely on caregiver assistance to transfer more independently. It will also decrease the risk
of falls and injuries for users and caregivers. Phase I results show that to improve manufacturability and
commercial potential, the initial prototype should offer more appropriate height levels for wheelchair users
(WCUs), added seating and positioning features, and a more maneuverable, sleeker base that can be kept at
bedside. The proposed Phase II study is organized around three aims. In Aim 1, we will develop a pre-production
prototype that enables level and downhill transfers between a wheelchair or bed and the PPAL, is suitable for
institutional and home use, and is designed for manufacturability. This will be accomplished by conducting design
reviews with stakeholders, designing for manufacturability, conducting engineering testing in accordance with
standards, performing in lab evaluations with stakeholders, and revising the prototypes based on feedback
received. In Aim 2, we will assess the usability and utility of PPAL in real-world home settings and short-term
impact on fall/near fall incidence, level of toileting assistance, fear of falling and caregiver burden. The PPAL will
be placed in residences of WCUs and their formal or informal caregivers. Outcomes will be assessed at baseline
and at the conclusion of a 6-week device trial. Aim 3 will develop and validate clinical guidelines for PPAL use.
An interdisciplinary stakeholder group of expert clinicians and Safe Patient Handling and Movement (SPHM)
professionals will be convened to assist with identifying clinical parameters for the safe prescription of the PPAL.
The long-term commercial goal of the project is to provide a toileting solution that will increase user independence
and decrease both user and caregiver injury. The PPAL will be suitable for deployment in homes, skilled nursing
and rehabilitation facilities as well as hospitals.

The goal of the current study is to complete IND enabling studies to develop a therapeutic based on
D6PV, a novel ApoC-II peptide mimetic, by conducting toxicology studies and manufacturing GMP drug
substance and drug product for future Phase 1 trials in normal healthy volunteers. Successful
completion of aims proposed here will result in the development of a novel peptide mimetic as an
intravenous formulation with a rapid onset of action for the treatment of hospitalized patients with acute
pancreatitis to rapidly reduce triglycerides to prevent or treat hypertriglyceridemia, and therefore will
reduce the length of stay in the hospital and reduce or eliminate the morbidity and mortality. A safety
assessment will be completed in IND enabling studies and a NOAEL (no adverse effect load)
determined to support first-in-human dosing. This will enable Protean Bio to advance D6PV for Phase
1 clinical trials in normal healthy volunteers to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of
D6PV after single and multiple ascending dosing regimens. Once completed and demonstrated to be
safe in humans, D6PV is anticipated to progress to Phase 2 trials in hospitalized AP patients for proof-
of-concept (i.e., efficacy) for reducing triglycerides in < 4 hours after administration as an intravenous
dose. AP is one of the most common diagnosis for GI-related hospitalization with significant morbidity
and at an annual cost of $2.6B. Severe Hypertriglyceridemia (SHTG) is a leading cause for AP and is
known to occur in up to 38% of patients with plasma triglyceride (TG) levels of 3000-5000 mg/dL.
Although there are several approved products (e.g., Vascepa®, Epanova®) and new modalities
(nucleic acid drugs, antibodies) in Phase 2/3 trials for the treatment of SHTG, they have a delayed
onset of action, rendering them unsuitable for rapidly lowering triglycerides in hospitalized AP patients.
Therefore, there is a clear unmet need for rapidly addressing elevated TG in AP patients in an acute,
hospitalized setting to reduce pain and progression of pancreatic necrosis, organ failure and mortality.
Superior ex vivo results were confirmed in in vivo studies in mice models of HTG, demonstrating a
~80% reduction of plasma HTG in 3 hours post dosing and ~85% decrease in plasma ApoC-III; the
latter due to displacement by D6PV and subsequent clearance. In this Direct to Phase II grant, we
propose to complete engineering validation of the non-GMP manufacturing process, complete IND-
enabling studies in rat and dog, and manufacture GMP drug substance and drug product.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Recently, WHO and CDC designated Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) a Priority 1 ‘critical
superbug’ and an ‘Urgent Threat’, and warned that new treatments for superbugs, which kill nearly 50,000
Americans and Europeans a year, are unlikely to be developed in time if left to market forces alone. Few
therapeutic options are left to treat CRE, and the fear of ‘pan-resistant’ CRE has emerged. Currently, most CRE
infections occur in a hospital setting, but the potential spread of CRE in the community also exists. Entirely new
agents with novel mechanisms of action languish; completely novel antibacterials with a new mechanism of
action and lacking clinical cross-resistance to existing drug classes are urgently needed. Our proposal aims to
develop a mechanistically novel, IV and PO administered agent to treat uncomplicated and complicated UTI
cases caused by antibiotic susceptible and multidrug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, including extended spectrum
beta-lactamase producers and CRE. Using an innovative overexpression-based co-culture screen in Escherichia
coli (Ec), we identified four structurally distinct series of small molecule inhibitors targeting MsbA, an essential
and broadly conserved Gram-negative (GN) ABC transporter responsible for lipopolysaccharide (LPS)
biogenesis and construction of the Gram-negative outer membrane (OM). A prioritization of the four series
through our current R21AI146541-supported program has enabled selection of a series to enter the Lead
Identification (ID) phase of development. We propose the following aims to develop this series:
Aim 1 (2 years) - Lead ID to select a single lead series with WT activity and efficacy for Aim 2 Lead
Optimization (Op): 1.1) exploratory med chem to improve WT activity, 1.2) obtain high resolution MsbAi-MsbA
X-ray co-crystal structure to guide structure-based drug design (SBBD) using the Schrodinger Discover Suite,
1.3) monitor whole cell (MIC) activity, 1.4) track in vitro IC50 potency, 1.5) test ppb, mammalian cytotoxicity, and
P-gp inhibition/stimulation, 1.6) FOR, time kill curves, and LpxC inhibitor synergy studies, 1.7) measure PK, 1.8)
determine Enterobacteriaceae MIC90, 1.9) synthetic scale up, 1.10) dose-ranging mouse PK/formulation studies,
and 1.11) demonstrate in vivo efficacy in a mouse peritonitis model of WT Ec infection.
Aim 2 (3 years) - Lead Op to prepare a Pre-Clinical Candidate (PCC) for subsequent safety studies: 2.1)
med chem optimization of drug-like properties, 2.2) track MIC, IC50, and cytotoxicity, 2.3) conduct in vitro ADME,
2.4) single mouse (IV, IP, PO) PK, 2.5) validate MOA and FOR, 2.6) test in vitro mammalian off target-activity,
2.7) expanded Enterobacteriaceae MIC90, 2.8) dose-ranging mouse PK, 2.9) synthetic scale up, 2.10) efficacy
in murine UTI model, 2.11) identify PK/PD index, 2.12) expanded off target-activity as in 2.6.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Project Summary Abstract
Mosquitoes infect hundreds of millions of people with deadly pathogens every year. Since mosquitoes
identify humans and other important resources primarily via their sense of smell, the disruption of
mosquito olfactory systems has long been recognized as a potential strategy for controlling these
pathogens. For example, repellants that scramble or block the detection of odors may be used to push
mosquitoes away from humans and the areas where we live and work. Conversely, irresistibly attractive
blends of volatile chemicals may be deployed to pull mosquitoes into lethal traps. Despite some
advances in this area over the past decade, progress has been limited by the fact that the olfactory
systems of our most important vector mosquitoes remain largely uncharacterized. We know that
mosquitoes detect odors using tens to hundreds of ligand-specific olfactory receptors expressed in
approximately 60 different types of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) found on their antennae and
maxillary palps. But we don’t yet know exactly which neurons mosquitoes rely on for detecting humans,
flowers, and oviposition sites, nor which receptors are expressed in those neurons. Moreover, exciting
preliminary data from our lab and others indicates that the 1-to-1 matching between receptors and
sensory neurons observed in Drosophila vinegar flies does not apply in mosquitoes. Instead, mosquito
sensory neurons appear to express multiple, ligand-specific receptors. This means that the tuning of the
neurons that drive behavior cannot be equated to the tuning of individual receptors and thus helps to
explain why previous receptor-focused studies have largely failed to unlock the logic of mosquito host
attraction. Here, we propose to characterize the molecular and functional properties of all major OSN cell
types on the antennae of the arbovirus vector mosquito Aedes aegypti. In Aim 1, we will conduct single-
nucleus RNA sequencing of antennal neurons to identify putative OSN cell types and the receptors
expressed therein. In Aim 2, we will use CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing to generate OSN type-specific
expression drivers that can be used to match OSN types to their target glomeruli in the antennal lobe of
the brain. In Aim 3, we will use in vivo antennal lobe imaging to characterize the tuning of a subset of
OSN types to a panel of 200-300 biologically relevant odorants and natural blends. Taken together we
expect to generate a receptor-neuron-glomerulus map for this important disease vector and a library of
genetic tools with which to manipulate it—facilitating the identification of the neurons that drive behavior
and opening the door to the efficient and rational design of chemical repellants and attractants for use in
vector control.

Dynamin GTPases have critical roles in mediating endocytosis by wrapping around the neck of budding vesicles
to catalyze membrane fission necessary for the release of nascent vesicles from the plasma membrane.
Recently, we discovered a novel role for dynamin in bundling numerous actin filaments, which has implications
for actin-mediated processes, such as cell-cell fusion and migration. While structural and biophysical studies
have elucidated the mechanism of dynamin assembly and constriction of membranes, several unanswered
questions remain including how dynamin is actually organized and mediates fission within cells, how dynamin
forms the final pre-fission state where it wraps around lipid tubules in a superconstricted state, how dynamin
binds substrates via the proline rich domain (PRD), and how substrate binding regulates dynamin activity. The
long-term objective of this application is to elucidate the mechanism of dynamin-mediated membrane fission
from in vitro and in vivo studies, and to define the mechanism of dynamin interaction with actin and SH3 domain-
containing proteins that recruit dynamin to sites of endocytosis. These objectives will be addressed by the
following specific aims: (1) determine the atomic model of dynamin in the superconstricted prefission state
and define the structure of the PRD; (2) investigate the assembly of the dynamin helical polymer on membranes
within cells; and (3) Elucidate the mechanism of PRD interaction with actin filaments and SH3 domain-containing
binding partners. The rationale for these aims is that: (1) there is no atomic model describing the structural
basis by which dynamin constricts membranes to 3.4 nm in the superconstricted state where spontaneous
hemifission and membrane fission occurs; (2) how dynamin is actually organized in cells has not been reported;
and (3) the structure of the critical PRD and how it binds dynamin substrates including actin, amphiphysin and
intersectin is unknown. The research design and methods are as follows : Aim 1, Apply cryo-electron
microscopy (cryo-EM) to determine the structure of full-length dynamin (containing the PRD) organized around
lipid tubules in the superconstricted state; Aim 2, obtain cryo-electron tomograms and subtomogram averages
of dynamin within cells transfected with a GTPase-deficient dynamin mutant which delays membrane fission and
extends the lifetime of dynamin helices on cellular membranes; Aim 3, obtain the cryo-EM structure of actin
filaments decorated with PRD from dynamin, as well as complexes of dynamin/amphiphysin and
dynamin/intersectin. This work is of

Emerging evidence indicates that women are more likely to use a multipurpose prevention technology (MPT) for
pregnancy and HIV/STI infection prevention than a product for pregnancy or HIV/STI infection prevention. The
MPT development space is dominated by products that contain one or more hormonal contraceptives, which
many women, including breastfeeding women, cannot or will not use. Amphora gel is an exception. Ampphora
is a non-hormonal, vaginally-acting contraceptive product for women being developed by Evofem Biosciences
Inc. It works by maintaining a low vaginal pH that is hostile to sperm, bacteria, and viruses. Evofem recently
completed a Phase 3 contraceptive efficacy trial of Amphora that indicated typical use efficacy of 86.0% and per
protocol efficacy (perfect use) of 98.7%, comparable to the efficacy of the most commonly used forms of
hormonal contraception, oral pills. Amphora is currently being tested in Phase 2b trials for prevention of
urogenital chlamydia and gonorrhea in women and preparing for trials for prevention of recurrent bacterial
vaginosis (BV), which has completed enrollment. QGRFT is a stable analog of the non-antiretroviral (non-ARV)
anti-HIV lectin griffithsin (GRFT). We completed a Phase 1 trial of a vaginally administered GRFT gel, and
with PATH developed a novel vaginally administered GRFT fast dissolving insert (FDI) that significantly
prevented simian human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) infection in macaques and HSV-2 and HPV infection in
mice. Our long term goal is to develop an Amphora/QGRFT FDI for adolescent girls and a wide range of women,
including breastfeeding women, which provides non-hormonal contraception and reduces the risk of acquiring a
broad range of viral and bacterial STIs. Herein we will evaluate the feasibility, safety, and in vivo efficacy of two
innovative MPT prototypes: an Amphora/QGRFT FDI that could have contraceptive and anti-HIV/STI/BV
properties and an Amphora-only FDI that could have contraceptive and anti-STI/BV properties. The
prototypes will be manufactured and then evaluated in a series of in vitro assays, physiochemical
property/stability evaluations, and in vivo studies to demonstrate FDI disintegration, drug retention in the vagina,
safety, anti-HIV activity (pharmacodynamics studies in a macaque model and in vivo efficacy in macaques) and
anti-HSV-2 activity (murine model). The Amphora/QGFRT FDI may offer more potent anti-HSV-2 activity than
Amphora alone due to QGRFT’s anti-HSV-2 activity. Using data obtained in these studies, we will select one FDI
to advance into contraceptive efficacy testing in rabbits and IND-enabling toxicology studies in rats. The novel
non-hormonal FDI proposed here could (i) eliminate side effects associated with hormonal contraceptives, (ii)
meet the needs of women who have infrequent sex or who are breastfeeding, and (iii) reduce the sexual
acquitision of HIV/STIs and the emergence of ARV-resistant HIV. This woman-initiated FDI has the potential to
improve women’s health and advance the MPT field. When approved, the FDI would be the first non-hormonal,
on-demand and event-driven MPT with both contraceptive and broad spectrum anti/HIV/STI properties.

 Despite advances in sequencing, imaging and screening technologies, morphological changes in nuclear
structure are still utilized as a common and reliable diagnosis of cancer. Healthy cells invariably have ellipsoid,
smooth nuclear shape and distinctive chromatin distribution, while cancerous cells are characterized by irregular,
jagged nuclear shape and disrupted chromatin distribution. Relatedly, one of the most commonly mutated
proteins in human cancers is a component of the chromatin remodeler BAF complex known as ARID1A. These
mutations lose nucleosome sliding activity, leading to altered transcriptome and cancer progression. As a
structural scaffold of the BAF complex, many of the mutations in ARID1A that cause cancer result in early
truncation and lead to loss of BAF complex assembly. However, driver mutations also exist in the relatively
uncharacterized intrinsically disordered regions of ARID1A whose molecular mechanism is unknown.
 Investigations into nuclear organization have identified the importance of intrinsically disordered regions
and phase separation in dictating overall nuclear structure and organization, as well as forming nuclear bodies
like the nucleolus, and chromatin compartments like heterochromatin, but until recently we have not been able
to control this organization, or link it conclusively to chromatin compartment function. The Brangwynne lab has
developed optogenetic tools that allow for control of in vivo biophysical behavior of condensates.
 As a Life Science Research Fellow through the Mark Foundation for Cancer Research, I have determined
the role of chromatin-chromatin crosslinking protein HP1a in determining nuclear shape and mechanics, as well
as discovered rules for chromatin inclusion, exclusion, and compaction dictated by phase separated
compartments. In this proposal I will expand my research to understand the biophysical changes that occur in
these nuclear compartments upon ARID1A mutations that drive cancer, and how this is connected to their
disease phenotype. In Aim 1, I will interrogate interactions that dictate how condensates interact with chromatin,
and utilize light-triggered phase separation to modulate chromatin compaction and transcription in living cells. In
Aim 2, I will determine how the chromatin polymer directs phase separation, and how nuclear stiffness influences
nuclear body volume and functional output. In Aim 3, under the guidance of my co-mentor Dr. Cigall Kadoch, I
will utilize knowledge gained in Aims 1 and 2 to build a molecular mechanism of BAF complex proteins ARID1A
and ARID1B in oncogenesis, including the roles of their IDRs in targeting BAF complex activity and effects of
cancer-associated mutations on condensation behavior, sequence targeting and transcriptional output.
 With the support of my mentors and the greater research environment at both Princeton University and
the Dana Farber Cancer Institute, I will have access to unique tools, and will receive training in cancer biology
methods, biophysical theory, and next-generation sequencing assays. Together, these aims will provide a new
perspective on nuclear organization in cancer that may lead to novel venues of therapeutics.

 Cognitive functions of the brain are underpinned by complex and highly dynamic neural activities at the
sub-cellular levels and millisecond time scales. To discover the normal/abnormal neuronal activities and thus
understand detailed mechanisms of neurological disorders and dysfunctions such as Alzheimer’s,
Parkinson’s disease and ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis), measurement tools that offer sufficient
spatiotemporal resolution are needed. Fluorescence imaging/microscopy is one of the state-of-the-art
technologies for high spatial resolution recording of the activity of neuron populations. However, existing
fluorescence neural imaging technologies generally have limited speed, providing less than a few hundred
frames per second at most. High-speed imaging is particularly challenging for miniaturized, head-mounted
imagers used for in vivo studies on freely-behaving animals. The milliseconds or slower temporal resolution
substantially precludes measuring the precise timing of the generation and propagation of neuron spikes,
which is the key component of neural signaling. Moreover, current head-mounted fluorescence imagers use
epi-fluorescence illumination, which cannot reject out-of-focus background fluorescence, resulting in low
discrimination of voltage-sensitive signals from the thin membranes of individual neurons.
 During this R&D program, Physical Sciences Inc. (PSI) and the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard
propose to develop and demonstrate a high-speed (>kHz frame rate), head-mounted, confocal imager
that can optically capture neuronal electrical activity with high spatiotemporal details. Technology
innovations are proposed to enable this capability. First, an “active sensing” signal detection method
combines two complementary imaging channels to achieve parallel neuronal recording with both sub-micron
spatial resolution and sub-millisecond temporal resolution. Second, a novel hybrid fiber bundle scanning
approach achieves confocal imaging capability based on a miniaturized optical setup. During the proposed
Phase I, we will demonstrate the feasibility of the technology by imaging cultured neurons and brain slices
labeled with voltage fluorescent indicators. Then, we will upgrade the technology to a miniaturized imager to
further demonstrate its performance during in vivo imaging of mice. These test experiments will demonstrate
high spatiotemporal resolution recording of fast action potentials from individual neurons and sub-cellular
neuron structures (e.g., dendrites and synapses). This R&D project will result in a robust technology for non-
invasive recording of neuronal kinetics with high spatiotemporal resolution on freely-behaving animals,
offering a critical tool for neuroscience research.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：The neural crest is a multipotent embryonic cell population that gives rise to most of the craniofacial skeleton,
including cartilage, bone and connective tissue. Misregulation of neural crest development results in the vast
majority of craniofacial malformations and birth defects. Thus, uncovering the molecular and genetic
underpinnings of neural crest formation has important implications for the diagnosis and treatment of these
pathologies. Neural crest development is orchestrated by a multi-level gene regulatory network, in which
progenitor cells are progressively committed to a neural crest fate. This process requires not only shifts in gene
expression but also an extensive remodeling of the epigenomic landscape. The chromatin remodeling events
which occur between two respective stages of neural crest formation, induction and specification, are driven in
part by the action of the pioneer factor TFAP2A. TFAP2A activates distinct sets of genomic regions during
induction and specification of neural crest cells, and its target specificity is dependent upon its dimerization with
paralogous proteins TFAP2C and TFAP2B. This heterodimeric switch between TFAP2A/C and TFAP2A/B acts
to drive the transition from induction to specification, allowing for progressive cell fate commitment of neural
crest cells. Consistent with this idea, TFAP2B expression is both necessary and sufficient to drive the transition
from induction to specification. Analysis of an enhancer of TFAP2B has implicated SMAD2/3 nuclear effectors
as predicted drivers of TFAP2B expression. This observation has led to the hypothesis that TFAP2 pioneer
factors integrate environmental signals into the gene regulatory network to drive the transition from induction to
specification within the neural crest lineage. The F99 phase of this proposal aims to investigate the role of
SMAD nuclear effectors and their upstream signaling systems in the control of TFAP2B expression and
consequently the neural crest specification program. This work will shed light on how environmental stimuli act
to remodel the chromatin landscape within the presumptive neural crest.
Moreover, while much focus has been paid to understand the cis-regulatory control of neural crest cell
formation, we still have very little insight on the molecular mechanisms by which these cells differentiate to
form the bone and cartilage of the face. Single-cell analysis of chromatin accessibility in neural crest
differentiation will allow for the identification of enhancer elements specific to numerous facial compartments.
Furthermore, identification of compartment-specific drivers will reveal how these regulatory factors act to
orchestrate the formation of highly complex and nuanced structures within the craniofacial skeleton. Ultimately,
this data may be used to gain a mechanistic understanding of the etiology of congenital birth defects linked to
the misregulation of craniofacial morphogenesis.

 Aggression is a key aspect of animal social life, playing critical roles in territorial defense, resource
acquisition, and protection of offspring. Like other behaviors, aggression is reinforced through experience.
This reinforcement often serves beneficial purposes, improving territory defense and protection of offspring –
vital behaviors for individual and species survival. However, experience can also promote pathological levels
of persistent aggression. In humans, this can harm an individual’s mental health and put others at risk. Thus,
there is a need for improved treatment options based on an individual’s prior and on-going history with
aggression. Accordingly, my goal is to identify how aggressive experience alters neural circuit computations
to generate persistent aggressive behavior. Specifically, this work will probe how experience changes
synaptic connectivity and neural activity between two subcortical regions that play critical roles in social
behavior: the ventrolateral ventromedial hypothalamus (VMHvl) and medial preoptic area (MPOA). The
VMHvl neural activity is necessary and sufficient for aggressive behavior. The MPOA is an influential node
regulating many social behaviors and sends the largest source of GABAergic input to the VMHvl.
Nevertheless, the role of the MPOA in aggression is enigmatic, and it remains unknown if MPOA inhibitory
input to VMHvl can shut down, or gate, aggression or how social experience affects this circuit. To study the
MPOA VMHvl circuit, this proposal combines: (1) ex vivo brain slice electrophysiology for optogenetic-
assisted circuit mapping and quantification of experience-dependent changes in synaptic strength within the
MPOA VMHvl circuit; (2) cell-type and pathway specific calcium recordings in socially interacting mice ; (3)
novel algorithms for tracking animal posture dynamics and subsequent methods for unsupervised behavior
detection and quantification; and, (4) in vivo optogenetic manipulations to identify the changes in circuit
function that link aggressive experience to future persistent aggression. Aim 1 tests the ability of aggressive
experience to relax the strength of the synaptic connections between MPOA GABAergic (MPOAvgat) input to
distinct, genetically-identified populations of VMHvl neurons. Aim 2 determines if aggressive experience
increases in vivo aggression-related VMHvl population activity. Finally, Aim 3 tests the ability of MPOAvgat
neurons to gate aggression before and after aggressive experience. Taken together, these experiments will
achieve the long-term objective of identifying novel circuit and synaptic treatment targets for aggression-
related pathologies based on patients’ behavioral history. Completion of this fellowship will achieve Dr.
Guthman’s training goals, providing her with experimental expertise in systems neuroscience to complement
her current command of single neuron synaptic physiology. The proposed plan will provide her with the
training to tackle social neuroscience research questions from synapse to behavior.

dimensional space is critical for proper gene expression and genome maintenance. Of note are topologically-
associated domains (TADs) containing neighborhoods of insulated chromatin loop regions bound by clustered
cohesin and CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) homodimers. The integrity and maintenance of these insulated
neighborhoods are important as disruptions to loop structure can result in gene misregulation and proto-
oncogene activation. However, current biochemical tools are insufficiently developed to study questions
concerning the mechanism of neighborhood formation, regulation and dynamics. Thus, we need molecular tools
that enable real-time, high-resolution analysis with minimal pertubation on cellular function.
 This proposal will combine molecular biology tools with the knowledge of photochemistry to develop
an optogenetic tool for labeling the molecular interactome within live cells. A genetically-encodable
photocatalytic protein (SOPP) is used to generate reactive intermediates from a biotin-appended probe that in
turn, covalently tag biomolecular interactions within radial distance of protein localization. Preliminary
experiments nuclear proteins can be labeled with high temporal specificity using short irradiation times. I
anticipate that this method will be applied towards mapping the protein interactomes of other organelles, using
quantitative proteomic data as further confirmation of this method. Conditional systems for proximity labeling
using split-SOPP (sSOPP) will be developed for proximity-gated microenvironment mapping. Finally, SOPP-
activatable chemical probes with different reactivities and radial labeling radius will be synthesized and validated.
 Using this new optogenetic proximity labeling tool, the three-dimensional architecture of chromatin will be
mapped using nuclease dead Cas9 (dCas9)-SOPP fusions guided to genomic sites using defined signal guide
RNAs (sgRNAs). SOPP-CTCF and SOPP-cohesin fusions will be used to map multisite interactions. This
approach should provide insight into the dynamics of factors that engage genes within insulated regions.
Additionally, using the sSOPP approach for proximity-gated CTCF-cohesin labeling will provide a more accurate
picture of loop region interactomics. Lastly, the dCas9-SOPP technology will be used to study the differences in
the interactome of intact and disrupted proto-oncogene containing loops, especially with regard to the factors
involved in gene regulation. As a more holistic approach to mapping molecular interatomics, an orthogonal
nucleic acid labeling method will be adapted to this workflow to create a multiplexed system capable of mapping
both protein and nucleic acid chromatin neighborhood loop interactomes in live cells.
 Successful completion of the proposed research will provide a new optogenetic tool that will be used
by the broader epigenetics community to understand the causative impacts of higher-order
chromosomal architecture on gene regulation, and their role in cancer development and progression.

Bacteria are bombarded by infecting viruses, called phages, in natural habitats. Upon infection of a host, phages
must undertake one of two lifestyles: lysogeny where the phage remains in the host and is passed down to
offspring, or lysis where the phage replicates, kills the host, and spreads to new cells. Phages have been thought
to transition from lysogeny to lysis exclusively in response to host stress and DNA damage. New research from
the Bassler laboratory has revealed that phages can monitor host communication molecules, called
autoinducers. In a process called quorum sensing, bacteria produce, release, and detect autoinducers, and in
response, orchestrate group behaviors. Quorum-sensing-responsive phages detect host-produced autoinducers
and exploit the information they garner to drive their lysis-lysogeny lifestyle transitions. These recent findings
position me to discover how phages manipulate bacterial hosts and the consequences to the host, to the multi-
species bacterial community of which the host is a member, and to the eukaryotic host in which all the entities
reside. The overarching goal of my research is to define how cross-domain communication between vibriophage
VP882, the first phage discovered to “eavesdrop” on quorum sensing, and its host, the global pathogen Vibrio
cholerae, launches the phage lytic cycle. Using a combination of genetic, biochemical, and structural
approaches, I will identify the molecular mechanisms underlying this host-phage chemical communication
process. First, I will learn skills in bacterial genetics from experts in the Bassler laboratory and conduct a genetic
screen to identify the repressor of the quorum-sensing-induced phage lytic cycle. Second, I will use biochemical
methods to quantitatively characterize interactions between two key signaling components in the quorum-
sensing-induced phage lysis pathway. Lastly, I will rely on my background in structural biology to solve the
structures of these same signaling components, individually and in complex, enabling atomic-level-resolution
understanding of the interactions required for the phage to undergo lifestyle transitions. The ideal outcomes of
my research are a mechanistic understanding of inter-domain chemical communication and new possibilities for
development of phage therapies. Honing my skills in bacterial genetics, protein biochemistry, and
macromolecular crystallography over the course of my postdoctoral training will enable me to launch an
independent research program at a top-tier research institution.

One debilitating feature of aging is the loss of cognitive abilities, especially memory decline. Alzheimer’s
disease reduces the healthspan of patients, resulting in a loss of independence and social relationships. The
disease is also financially burdensome to patients and society. Despite the increase in the prevalence of
Alzheimer’s disease, the mechanisms that underlie aberrant memory function are unclear, making the
treatment of memory decline challenging. It is well established that the CREB transcription factor is required for
long-term memory; however, not all factors involved in CREB-dependent long-term memory formation are
known yet. Identifying factors upstream and downstream in the CREB cascade could reveal new mechanisms
for the treatment and reversal of Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias. To identify new candidates that
function within the CREB pathway and regulate long-term memory consolidation, this proposal will examine the
role of specific nuclear factors (Aim 1), small non-coding RNAs (Aim 2), and glial factors (Aim 3) in CREB-
dependent long-term memory. Nuclear factors regulate gene transcription, so identifying which factors
modulate memory formation is critical. Small RNAs regulate gene expression transcriptionally and post-
transcriptionally, but their function in adult neurons and, in turn memory, has not been tested. Glia have
recently been implicated in memory, but how they support memory consolidation is largely unexplored. We are
using the well-established aging model system C. elegans to determine where and how these factors function
to regulate memory with age. Our lab has shown that the memory machinery, including the CREB requirement
for long-term memory consolidation, is conserved in C. elegans and we developed behavioral assays to test
learning and short-term and long-term associative memory. C. elegans serves as a powerful system to
investigate the molecular mechanisms of memory. There are ample genetic tools available, and, with the
worm’s simple nervous system, mechanisms by which candidate genes regulate memory can be easily
probed. By using behavioral assays, tissue-specific isolation techniques, and transcriptomic approaches, these
experiments will determine where and how specific nuclear factors, small RNAs, and glial factors function
within the CREB pathway to regulate memory formation with age. This proposal examines multiple facets of
CREB-dependent long-term memory and will identify new candidates and pathways required for memory
formation. These findings could lead to better therapeutics for reversing or treating age-related cognitive
decline in cases of neurodegenerative disease, including Alzheimer’s. The proposed research plan will provide
the applicant with extensive training in behavioral, molecular, and tissue-specific transcriptomic approaches to
study memory with age. The training in these techniques and the proposed individualized mentorship plan will
ensure the applicant is prepared for a career as an independent investigator, studying mechanisms of memory
and age-related cognitive decline.

the United States alone, over 100,000 new patients have been diagnosed with melanoma in 2021. While
plastic surgeons are frequently responsible for the oncologic reconstruction and removal of melanoma, few
surgeons in this field have the basic science training needed to understand the underlying molecular defects of
this condition or the dynamics of the mammalian epidermal microenvironment, in which they specialize. Such
knowledge is crucial for a holistic approach to the field of plastic surgery because the dysregulation of
intercellular communication between cells in this skin microenvironment, such as melanocytes, fibroblasts, and
keratinocytes, leads to various aesthetic and life altering defects such as those seen in vitiligo, keloid formation
and melanoma. We believe that a better understanding of developmental melanoblast migration can provide a
framework for future patient interventions and provide much needed context for future surgeons. This belief is
supported by recent studies in human melanoma, which show that the transcriptomic genetic profile of
melanoma cells closely mimic developmental melanoblasts. Second, it is well established that one of the
hallmarks of malignant melanoma is the loss of E-cadherin and upregulation of N-cadherin, but how adhesive
interactions between melanocytes and their surrounding keratinocytes via E-cadherin regulate melanocyte
behavior and homeostasis is not well understood. I hypothesize that melanocytes form specialized adhesions
with keratinocytes that serve to maintain the epidermal barrier while simultaneously promoting melanocyte
migration, colonization, and retention within the epidermis. I plan to test this hypothesis, by using the Cre-Lox
system under the control of a K14 epithelial promoter to selectively label melanocytes and knockout E-cadherin
in the keratinocyte microenvironment of the epidermis. I will then characterize the impact of disrupted
melanocyte-epithelial adhesions on melanocyte migration, protrusivity and colonization (Aim 1), identify the
composition and localization of melanocyte-epidermal adhesions and actin regulators (Aim 2) and determine
the impact of disrupted melanocyte-epithelial AJs on melanoma progression in a melanoma mouse model (Aim
3). This proposed project will be the first of its kind to characterize the impact of the surrounding keratinocyte
microenvironment on melanoblast migration and function; thus, seeing the epidermis as a complex
microenvironment with varying cell types, a biological reality that is often overlooked in medical training. This
proposed project and the training plan herein is designed to cultivate the necessary training to provide an
increase in translational research to the field of plastic surgery. This collaboration between Princeton University
and Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital Department of Plastic Surgery provides the clinical, basic
science training, mentorship, and resources necessary to accomplish this goal. It is our hope that this work will
be used to benefit patients with a history of melanoma worldwide.

Human Cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a herpesvirus whose seroprevalence and disease burden remain high
worldwide. While disease is often mild in immunocompetent individuals, it is often severe for
immunocompromised individuals, and congenital infection remains a leading cause of birth defects. There is
currently no vaccine or permanent effective anti-viral therapy against HCMV. The host enzyme telomerase,
which maintains telomeres to protect the integrity of DNA, is key for cell survival and has been implicated in
several diseases including cancer. Telomerase has been implicated as an important agent in the life cycles
and potential oncogenic activity of several herpesviruses, and recently has been shown to be hyperactive in
response to active HCMV infection. Furthermore, telomerase inhibition has been associated with a significant
reduction of viral infectivity in laboratory and clinical strains of HCMV. However, the significance of telomerase
in the HCMV viral life cycle, and the potential therapeutic implications of this relationship, remain unexplored.
We hypothesize host telomerase is important for the HCMV viral life cycle. We will first establish telomerase
activity upregulation upon HCMV infection, and reduced HCMV replication following telomerase inhibition, in
multiple strains and cell lines using several approaches to telomerase repression. Assays of telomerase
activity in the presence of pharmaceutical telomerase inhibitors BIBR1532 and MST-312 will establish a
reduction of viral infectivity following telomerase inhibition in both laboratory and clinical strains. Subsequent
assays using inducible genetic inhibitors, specifically siRNA and inducible shRNA constructs against hTERT,
will test whether reduction of viral replication is a result of telomerase inhibition and not off-target effects. To
define the mechanism of action by which HCMV upregulates telomerase activity, we will assess telomerase
activity following ectopic expression and shRNA-mediated knockdown of key viral genes, and implicated gene
products will be subjected to binding assays in infected and telomerase-inhibited infected conditions to assess
association with DNA via ChiP and QTIP assays, and with other proteins via IP and mass spectrometry. ChiP
assays in infected and telomerase-inhibited infected conditions will also be performed on host proteins
previously shown to influence telomerase activity. To define the function of telomerase in the viral life cycle, we
will conduct differentially-timed inhibition of telomerase and assess the viral gene class(es) the activity of which
is constrained by the absence of telomerase. Overall, these experiments will establish the potential clinical
relevance of telomerase in HCMV infection and define both the mechanism of action by which HCMV
upregulates telomerase activity and the function of telomerase in the viral life cycle. Increased understanding
of these relationships may provide insight into other herpesviruses, inform clinical HCMV management, and
lead to new anti-viral therapies.

Categorization is a fundamental aspect of human cognition that allows for efficient learning, generalization, and
communication. Throughout development, humans categorize the objects, people, and events around them.
The proposed work examines social categorization with a focus on gender. Gender categories are early
emerging, yet influential throughout the lifespan. Broader societal ideas about gender appear to be changing,
however, and this grant asks how those changes may or may not be reflected in how adolescents are
categorizing gender, their beliefs about gender, and their self-categorization by gender. Using a pair of
longitudinal studies, including a 5-year annual study (ongoing from the previous grant period) and a month-long
daily experience sampling study, this grant will document how these constructs are or are not changing
amongst adolescents and the relation between these constructs and their social environments. Finally, in this
work, we examine the links between adolescents’ beliefs about gender, self-categorization with gender, and
their health and well-being. Participants include adolescents and adults who are gender diverse and cisgender.
Together this work will advance theory and practice about topics ranging from categorization and adolescent
gender development to reducing mental health disparities in transgender youth.

Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection results in 887,000 deaths annually. The central challenge in curing
HBV is eradication of the stable covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) form of the viral genome, which
depends on elusive host factors for its generation. Using a yeast extract screen, we identified five core
components of lagging strand synthesis –PCNA, the replication factor C (RFC) complex, DNA polymerase δ
(POLδ), FEN-1, and DNA ligase 1 (LIG1) – as essential for cccDNA formation. We reconstituted cccDNA
formation with purified human homologs, establishing these as a minimal set of factors necessary and
sufficient for cccDNA formation. We further demonstrated that inhibiting POLδ significantly diminishes
cccDNA formation. In this proposal, we will build on these findings to determine the precise kinetics of
cccDNA formation, delineating the role of each factor at every step of the repair process. In understanding the
dynamics of rcDNA to cccDNA repair, we can identify potential rate-limiting steps that could be novel
therapeutic targets for disrupting cccDNA formation and maintenance. Using a series of innovative techniques
in both cell culture and mouse model systems, we will be able to test our findings in physiologically relevant
platforms that will strengthen the impact of our data. Factors found to be critical for rc- to cccDNA
conversion will be disrupted in these systems by a degron-mediated approach that will allow for fine-tuned
control of expression to alleviate any potential cytotoxicity. We can then monitor the effect of each factor in
turn on cccDNA formation or the maintenance of established cccDNA pools in chronically infected cells. To
increase the resolution of such studies, we will also examine at the single-cell level how the expression levels
of a given factor correlate with that of cccDNA. Altogether, these data will give us a far more comprehensive
view of this process critical to the persistence of HBV in chronically infected individuals.

Cancer genomics has transformed the study and treatment of cancer. Nevertheless, the interpretation of
genetic alterations observed in tumor samples remains a major challenge in both basic science and clinical
settings. The functional roles of the vast majority of somatic alterations observed within cancer cells are
unknown: it is typically not known if a specific mutation plays a role in cancer growth or anti-cancer immune
response, or what impact (if any) an observed alteration has on cellular pathways. These gaps in knowledge
are major impediments towards personalized cancer treatments, from uncovering actionable mutations that
can be targeted by drugs to designing personalized cancer neoantigen vaccines. Further, for diverse
population groups to reap the benefits of cancer genomics, it is critical to develop computational methods that
explicitly consider genome variation and that are designed to identify and potentially mitigate inequities. Our
long-term goal is to develop computational approaches that work well across diverse populations in identifying
medically relevant alterations within cancer genomes. We have developed a powerful suite of methods to
discover cancer driver genes based upon integrating observed somatic mutations with knowledge about
cellular networks and a multidimensional view of protein functionality at the level of individual sites. We will
build upon on our prior work by devising machine learning approaches to predict which specific somatic
mutations within genes drive cancer, along with software to visualize and interpret mutations with respect to
newly derived protein functional features. We will introduce integrative formulations to uncover the impact of
somatic alterations on downstream genes and pathways. We will devise approaches to uncover immune-
relevant somatic mutations based on predicting interactions between major histocompatibility complex proteins
and peptides mutated in cancer. We will design our approaches to be effective as well as equitable across the
diversity of human populations. We will release open-source implementations of the developed computational
methods. This project will advance the state-of-the-art in computational methods for interpreting cancer
genomes, deepen our understanding of cancer biology, and move the field further towards unlocking the
promise of personalized cancer treatments in an equitable manner.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is an important and underreported infectious disease, causing chronic infection in ~58
million people worldwide. The CDC estimates there are ~67,000 new cases of HCV every year in the US and
about 20,000 deaths annually, making HCV more deadly than 60 other infectious diseases combined, including
HIV. However, the underlying mechanisms that lead to chronic HCV infection followed by end-stage liver disease
are poorly understood. Although chronic hepatitis C can now be effectively treated with direct-acting antivirals, a
vaccine to prevent transmission remains a high priority due to extreme treatment costs (up to $50,000 for a 12-
week course) and the irreversibility of virally induced liver damage even in “cured” individuals. Efforts to better
understand HCV and develop effective vaccines have been limited by the lack of small animal models for this
virus, which only robustly infects humans and chimpanzees. In the proposed work, we will build on our substantial
research findings to meet this need for an immunocompetent animal model that will allow us to not only
systematically analyze the molecular basis of barriers to interspecies HCV transmission but also how such a
model could be leveraged for assessing vaccine candidates. Towards this end, we recently identified a highly
murine-adapted HCV variant, coined Mad18, with increased replicative capacity in primary murine hepatocytes,
which historically only poorly support HCV replication. Through continued passaging of Mad18 in HCV entry
factor transgenic (EFT) mice with impaired antiviral signaling (EFT Stat1-/-), we aim to further adapt this variant
to a murine physiological environment and define the underpinning biological mechanism (Aim 1). Our
considerable experience with studying viral infections in genetically humanized mice will be utilized to also study
Mad18 and its derivatives in a variety of new mouse lines, including immunocompetent models, with targeted
changes to increase their support of HCV infection (Aim 2). Our observations of persistent HCV infection in
hepatocytes from immunocompetent HCV entry factor knock-in mice that also express human TRIM26 (EFT
TRIM26[h/h]) put us in a strong position for these in vivo studies.
The Ploss lab has made many seminal contributions to the field and will be aided in this important work by our
long-standing collaborators Drs. Schwartz (Weill Cornell) and Pietschmann (Twincore, Germany). Our work will
advance the field of HCV research by making progress in deciphering the mechanism underlying the
exquisitely narrow host tropism and the development of small animal models suitable for studying HCV
infection and immune responses, a necessary precursor to improving treatment and developing vaccines.

Life is a complex and dynamics process that relies on intricate spatiotemporal interactions among molecules and
subcellular organelles within cells and multicellular organisms. Recent advances in light sheet fluorescence
microscopy (LSFM), have greatly expanded our capability to visualize, track and quantify these dynamic
interactions with high-resolution across all four dimensions (4D) of spacetime with minimum invasiveness and
photobleaching. Notable among the LSFM technologies is the lattice light sheet microscopy (LLSM), which
excels at 4D subcellular dynamics imaging with resolution, speed, and non-invasiveness superior to the widely
used confocal microscopy. However, the adoption of LSFM in biomedical research remains limited due to its
incompatibility with widely used sample holders such as multi-well plates or microfluidic chips. LSFM, when
operated in an inverted open-top configuration with two orthogonal high numerical aperture (NA) objectives,
experiences complex optical aberrations that severely degrade image quality. Significant efforts, including
specialized sample holder, single-objective architecture, and adaptive optics, have been devoted, but they are
either technically demanding or suffer from various performance drawbacks. A compact, high-performance, cost-
effective, and user-friendly LSFM system that suits the widely used sample holders has yet to be developed.
This proposal aims to address this crucial incompatibility between LSFM and high-throughput imaging by
leveraging recent advances in optical metasurfaces. These microfabricated 2D metasurfaces consisting of
nanoscale plasmonic arrays with subwavelength periodicity are capable of shaping light with an unprecedented
level of complexity and precision. We will develop an inverted open-top LLSM system with integrated optical
metasurfaces that is compatible with conventional high-throughput sample holders for imaging of molecular and
subcellular dynamics within live cells and multicellular organisms. In addition, we will create an open-source
computational pipeline to facilitate the design and fabrication of optical metasurfaces for user-defined open-top
LSFM configurations. Our proposed system will provide a compact, cost-effective, and high-performance solution
to overcome the limitations of existing LSFM systems, enabling biomedical researchers to visualize subcellular
dynamics in a high-throughput and noninvasive manner. To validate the effectiveness and applicability of our
system, we will demonstrate its performance through high-content molecular dynamic mapping of chimeric
antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cells and organelle profiling of zebrafish development. While the implementation of
our metasurface-integrated open-top LSFM is on LLSM, the metasurface design pipeline and integration protocol
can be readily adapted and extended to a wide range of existing LSFM systems. By combining the power of
LSFM with metasurfaces, our proposed technology will provide an accessible and high-performance solution for
high-resolution 4D imaging of physiological and pathological processes within live cells and organisms.

Sensorimotor learning and maintaining calibration of the motor system is essential for activities of daily living.
While the motor control literature has traditionally focused on a slow-learning, implicit process, recent work
highlights that rapid learning and readjustment of sensorimotor skills is supported by higher-order cognitive
strategies. The proposed research focuses on these cognitive strategies, and aims to understand their operation
during health and neurological disease. Based on our prior work, we propose that strategies may reflect two
broadly-classed mechanisms: an algorithm-like strategy that seeks to simulate the outcome of an intended action
before its execution and a retrieval-like mechanism that caches previously successful strategies in a short-term
memory store. We will ask whether these strategies can be improved over time, if people are sensitive to their
relative costs and constraints, and if they have differential impacts on the learning of an implicit system. All
studies will be conducted with neurologically-intact participants and individuals with spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA),
allowing us to assess the extent to which the cerebellum, which is known to play a critical role in sensorimotor
learning, supports strategy use. Importantly, we will determine if different kinds of strategies may form the basis
for viable, novel rehabilitation approaches for individuals with cerebellar damage or degeneration. These
strategies may represent an untapped or underappreciated resource for improving sensorimotor skill learning in
general, as well as a potential avenue for overcoming impairments associated with damage to the cerebellum
by exploiting extracerebellar circuits and resources not recruited by protocols that emphasize only implicit
sensorimotor learning. Alternatively, it may be that cerebellar damage also has a deleterious effect on an
individual’s ability to use cognitive strategies for sensorimotor control and learning, in line with recent findings
suggesting a prominent role for the cerebellum in cognition. In order to get to the heart of these issues, we will
systematically create conditions that require learners to adopt either an algorithmic or a retrieval-based strategy
to improve performance in a sensorimotor learning task. In addition to providing a more comprehensive account
of the nature of sensorimotor learning, the findings from the proposed work could also provide useful insights for
motor rehabilitation practices following cerebellar damage and degeneration.

Hippocampus is important for spatial memory. The prototypical neurophysiology is place cells一neurons that
are active at particular places in the environment (place fields). Collectively, place cells are thought to form
cognitive maps, an internal representation of the environment (i.e. spatial memory). Mechanistic models have
made predictions about the pattern of neural connectivity underlying cognitive maps. However, experimental
data of circuit structures are difficult to obtain, because neuronal arbors with synapses at nanometer scale are
densely packed in neuropils that span a millimeter or more in extent even for local circuits. Volume electron
microscopy is currently the only approach that can densely map neural connectivity at synaptic resolution
(connectomics). I have been trained in high-throughput transmission electron microscopy (TEM) techniques in
PhD, and more recently, I have developed an imaging pipeline with four current fastest TEMs. I will use
serial-section TEM imaging followed by circuit reconstruction to map local connectivity in hippocampus.
Furthermore, I will combine two-photon calcium imaging of neural activity during spatial navigation and EM
reconstruction on the same neurons (functional connectomics), to relate place fields of neurons to the
underlying neural circuits in the hippocampus. The goal is to experimentally test long-standing predictions on
patterns of neural connectivity by theoretical models: place cells with neighboring place fields are preferentially
connected with each other. Towards these goals, in my postdoctoral training I will develop methods to register
functionally imaged cells to the same cells in EM-reconstructed volume in the hippocampus and be exposed to
deep learning EM reconstruction approach. The training will take place in Princeton Neuroscience Institute,
under the guidance of Drs. David Tank and Sebastian Seung. With these skills, my goal is to develop an
independent research program of applying functional connectomic methods to relate circuit structure and
function in the hippocampus.

network of protein filaments, the most important being actin and microtubules (MTs). MTs are essential for
defining cellular shape and structure, as well as trafficking membrane-bound vesicles, organelles, and, during
cell division, chromosomes. To perform these functions, the cell must tightly regulate the formation of new MTs
via the process of MT nucleation. Cells primarily regulate MT nucleation by controlling the universal MT nucleator,
the γ-tubulin ring complex (γ-TuRC). To initiate MT nucleation, γ-TuRC is recruited to specialized regions known
as MT organizing centers (MTOCs), where γ-TuRC is activated and spatially oriented so that the resulting MT
has the appropriate polarity. Many of the first discovered MTOCs are also the most complex, including the basal
body, which generates flagellar MTs, and the centrosome, which generates many spindle MTs. These classical
MTOCs are composed of up to hundreds of unique proteins organized into complicated large-scale structures.
This makes them poorly suited to uncover MTOC function: namely, how MTOCs recruit, orient, and activate
γ-TuRC. To will illuminate these three basic principles by investigating γ-TuRC regulation in two model essential,
yet simple MTOCs: in the K99 phase, the vertebrate MT branch site and, in the R00 phase, the nuclear plaque
of model excavate Trypanosoma brucei. I will use a combination of reconstitution experiments and cryo-electron
tomography to uncover how these divergent, model MTOCs use shared principles to regulate γ-TuRC. My results
will both help the research community understand MTOC function, as well as provide new therapeutic avenues
to treat infection by parasitic excavates, an emerging global health threat.
 As proposed, this research plan will allow me to successfully pivot from my postdoctoral work with Dr. Petry,
an expert on vertebrate MT nucleation, to establish my own, independent research focus on excavate MT
nucleation and launch as an independent investigator. In addition, I have established a mentor team for the K99
phase of the proposal to train me in key technical areas that I require for the independent R00 phase. First, I will
master a TIRF-based assay pioneered in Dr. Petry’s lab that allows visualization of microtubule nucleation at the
single molecule level. Second, which I will learn cryo-electron tomography, a key technique of my proposal, in
collaboration with world experts Dr. Andreas Hoenger and Dr. Martin Beck. In learning this technique, I will
benefit from my mentorship team of Dr. Petry, Dr. Hoenger, Dr. Beck, and the cutting-edge vibrant structural
biology community at Princeton as a whole. Finally, I have recruited Dr. Chris de Graffenried, an expert in
excavate biology, to serve as a scientific mentor as I transition into this new model system. Through the training
phase of the proposal and beyond, I will learn from my mentor team how to successfully lead a research group
that fearlessly leverages a broad range of techniques and disciplines to answer critical scientific questions, and
will, in the R00 phase, establish this group at a leading U.S. institution.

Eating and drinking are rapid processes, but their postingestive effects are slow and delayed. How do animals
correctly associate these delayed effects (detection of nutrients or toxins in the gut) with transient stimuli like
tastes and smells that precede them by minutes or hours? To gain insight into this question, I leveraged the
fact that mice learn to associate novel, but not familiar, foods with gastric malaise signals to investigate what
distinguishes the neural representations of flavors that promote learning versus those that do not. I surveyed
brainwide expression of the immediate early gene Fos during drinking and during postingestive malaise and
discovered that distinct functional networks of flavor-selective brain regions are recruited at different phases of
postingestive learning. This led to two key hypotheses about how the brain is able to link tastes and flavors to
delayed postingestive feedback. During the postdoctoral phase (K99/Aim 1) of this proposal, I will test the
hypothesis that an amygdala network centered on the central amygdala (CEA) represents novel flavors during
drinking and that this representation is then reactivated when postingestive feedback signals from the gut
arrive, providing temporal overlap between the flavor representation and feedback that promotes learning. I will
first use high-density Neuropixels recordings to demonstrate that CEA novel flavor representations are
reactivated during postingestive malaise (Aim 1.1) and then use optogenetic activation of CEA novel flavor
ensembles to show that these postingestive reactivations are sufficient to drive learning (Aim 1.2). In the
independent phase (R00/Aim 2), I will test the hypothesis that a limbic network centered on the lateral septum
(LS) blocks these novel flavor reactivations to gate the formation of postingestive associations when flavors are
recognized as familiar and safe. I will first use axon terminal photostimulation to identify the specific LS
projection that gates learning (Aim 2.1) and then combine this manipulation with high-density neural recordings
in downstream regions (Aim 2.2) and brainwide Fos imaging (Aim 2.3) to investigate how LS activity blocks the
formation and reactivation of novel flavor representations. These experiments will generate key insights into
the cross-region neural mechanisms that support conditioned taste aversion and postingestive learning. During
the K99 phase, I will gain crucial technical expertise — in Neuropixels electrophysiology, advanced
computational tools, and activity-dependent genetic labeling — and professional development that will be
essential for my independent lab’s mission. Our ultimate goal will be to uncover general principles by which
interoceptive signals engage the brain to control behavior and how the mechanisms underlying postingestive
learning go awry in eating disorders and obesity.

This project will elucidate the psychological processes that give rise to gender disparities in mental health
across development. Despite efforts toward mitigating such disparities, gender-linked outcomes remain stark:
relative to men, women consistently report higher rates of internalizing problems and lower levels of self-
esteem. The relation between gender and mental health is evident by adolescence: thus, efforts to identify how
such disparities emerge—and, critically, how they may be mitigated—require a broad-based investigation into
the psychological processes that create and sustain them across development. To date, research into the
emergence and manifestation of gender differences in mental health has focused largely on the role of
biological factors linked to sex (e.g., differences in genetics, brain circuitry, or hormones). However, gender
identity—the extent to which one identifies as a boy/man, a girl/woman, nonbinary, or another gender—is
complex and multi-faceted. Not only is its relation to biology inconsistent, as in the case of gender-diverse
populations, but it is linked to a host of psychological variables (e.g., attributes, behaviors, and experiences)
that may themselves contribute to psychological distress. The proposed research will seek to achieve a more
holistic understanding of how gender disparities in mental health emerge by involving a diverse sample of
adolescents, including cisgender girls (gender identity: girl, assigned sex: female), transgender girls (gender
identity: girl, assigned sex: male), cisgender boys (gender identity: boy, assigned sex: male), and transgender
boys (gender identity: boy, assigned sex: female). This sample will be drawn from a large-scale longitudinal
study of socially-transitioned transgender and gender-diverse youth in North America (including 40+ U.S.
states), of which the project Sponsor is the Principal Investigator. Our research will seek to address several
important objectives across two waves of online data collection, spaced one year apart.
In Aim 1, we will distill the unique role of gender identity, relative to assigned sex, in predicting gender
disparities in mental health across adolescence. In Aim 2, we will elucidate the influence of relevant
psychological variables linked to gender (i.e., possession of feminine vs. masculine characteristics, reports of
self-objectification, and experiences of sexism) in accounting for gender disparities in mental health across
adolescence. By investigating gender disparities in mental health in a sample comprised of both cisgender and
gender-diverse adolescents, this research is well-positioned to clarify the role of gender-linked psychological
variables—relative to biological ones—in predicting gender disparities in mental health, thus opening up novel
pathways for achieving gender equity in this domain. Additionally, the proposed project enables us to expand
the inclusivity of research on mental health by affording us the opportunity to examine gender-based disparities
in mental health in the context of existing disparities between cisgender and gender-diverse adolescents.

Sanfilippo disease (mucopolysaccharidosis type III; MPS III) is a devastating neurodegenerative lysosomal
storage disorder of childhood whose pathologic features are neurologic: slowing of development, severe
behavioral problems, progressive cognitive decline, dementia, and decline in motor skills leading to immobility,
unresponsiveness, and death. We have focused on MPS IIID caused by a deficiency of alpha-N-
acetylglucosamine-6-sulfatase (GNS). Because MPS IIID is rare (1 in a million) and affects the brain (which is
difficult to treat) no cure or treatment is available and there are at least five patients in the USA to our knowledge.
Sanfilippo patient organizations have 19 additional cases registered around the world (see letter of support). Dr.
Patricia Dickson and Dr. Tsui-Fen Chou (LABioMed) have developed an enzyme replacement treatment (ERT)
for MPS IIID. Our strategy proposes to deliver recombinant human alpha-N-acetylglucosamine-6-sulfatase
(rhGNS) via intracerebroventricular infusion to effectively treat the underlying causes of the neurologic symptoms
that dominate MPS III pathology. ERTs can have a dramatic effect on the quality of life and patient development
especially when administered early in developments. There are several examples of successfully
commercialized ERT’s (e.g. laronidase (MPS I), idursulfase (MPS II), etc.) and BioMarin recently received
approval for an ERT for a form of Batten disease, CLN2. Other ERTs for MPS I, II, and IIIB are in Phase I trials.
Both the FDA and investors are familiar with ERT and its commercialization path, which will greatly increase the
chances of reaching a clinical trial. LABioMed has filed a US patent on rhGNS and Phoenix Nest, Inc. has
licensed it. Our pivotal nonclinical and manufacturing plans are on track.
We had a positive interaction with the FDA and got guidance for moving our program into the clinics. In
preparation for the interventional study the recommendation was for a thorough natural history study (NHS) in
the available patient population with a broad net to capture endpoints that are most likely to predict the clinical
benefits in each individual. Since the number of diagnosed patients is small the collected data form each
individual would be their own control at the time of intervention, where the patient will receive the recombinant
enzyme. Most of the work will be executed by contracted service providers. The clinical trial itself will be
conducted at NYU under the guidance of Dr. Lau. She has experience with over 10 clinical trials interventional
and observational. The clinical protocol was designed by the team at Phoenix Nest with help of KOLs and clinical
experts in the MPS III field. We have engaged expert third party clinical service providers to help with the
execution, monitoring and data collection. Crucial data collected from the patients on this study will help us
develop clinical outcomes that will be tools for measuring the efficacy of our rhGNS therapy and will be primary
endpoints on the pivotal study. The success on this trial will put a step closer to executing the pivotal trial to
assess the efficacy of our experimental therapy and its commercialization.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
Protein biologics constitute an important class of therapeutics owing to their high specificity, bioactivity and
potential for tunability. Cytokine (CK) proteins applied as biotherapeutics show great promise for several disease
indications, including cancer, multiple sclerosis, and hepatitis C infection. However, major barriers preventing
the advancement and widespread clinical use of CKs to address critical public health needs include: (I)
tendencies to cause systemic immune activation as a result of their on-target, off-tumor effects (ii) rapid
proteolytic degradation and clearance by the kidneys as small proteins (<20 KDa) with short half-lives in
circulation and (iii) frequent and high dosing leading to undesirable “peak-and-valley” pharmacokinetic (PK)
profile which result in (iv) reduced therapeutic efficacy, dose-limiting toxicities and reduce patient compliance.
New strategies are urgently needed for simultaneously targeting tumor antigens to build specificity and
localization while also tuning half-life. A multi-functionalized CK with tunable properties could lead to the next
generation of clinical biologics. Existing approaches to extend half-life such as the attachment of polyethylene
glycol moieties (PEG), tend to elicit undesired immunogenicity and new tools are required solve this defining
challenge. Pearl Bio’s proprietary synthetic biology platform technology is built on three core technologies:
Genomically Recoded Organisms (GROs), engineered orthogonal translation systems (OTS), and tethered
ribosomes for production of novel proteins incorporating synthetic amino acids (sAAs) including novel sAAs
previously inaccessible for precise functionalization. In proposed studies, we will leverage this platform to
demonstrate the tunability of CK half-life as well as tumor-targeting through precise and multi-site incorporation
and functionalization of sAAs with fatty acid groups. Specifically, we will (1) Demonstrate multisite incorporation
of sAAs into IL-15, (2a) Perform efficient lipidation and purification of synthetic IL-15 biologics with fatty acid for
tuning half-life, (2b) Enable tumor-targeting functionalization using engineered antibody/nanobody (multiple
instances if desired) and (3) Measure immunogenicity, bioactivity and albumin/tumor-antigen binding of these
IL-15 variants in vitro. In summary, during Phase 1 we will develop multi-site fatty acid functionalization of
cytokines and perform in vitro testing for bioactivity and immunogenicity. In Phase 2 studies, albumin and tumor
targeting capabilities would be combined to create a multi-functionalized CK with tunable half-life and tumor
specificity. Phase 2 in vivo studies will be used to test half-life tuning, tumor homing and efficacy of the multi-
functionalized CKs for further therapeutic development. We envision that this project could establish the basis
for entirely novel and programmable protein biologics with utility across a broad range of disease indications.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：ABSTRACT
Hundreds of thousands of children (669,799) were confirmed victims of maltreatment in the United States in
2017. In that same year, 34% of the 442,733 children in foster care had been in more than one placement and
11% were in a group home or institution. Out-of-home placement decisions have extremely high stakes for the
present and future well-being of these children because some placement types, and multiple placements, are
associated with poor outcomes. But which children require --and, more importantly, would benefit-- from a
placement in residential care? Decision-making support tools currently used by states to recommend specific
level-of-care (LOC) placements for children do not maximize the rich data and innovative methodological
approaches that are being explored in other fields like medicine. In addition, structured decision making (SDM)
has been used to guide decisions about risk in child welfare settings but, in comparison to predictive modelling,
SDM is limited by the use of a smaller group of factors to make recommendations. Outcome Referrals, Inc. has
employed sophisticated machine learning techniques over the past 10 years to risk-adjust behavioral health
outcome data for clients using their current characteristics. We have evidence of the predictive validity of this
approach for generating risk-adjusted scores via the PCORI-funded RCT in which clients were matched with
clinicians who had previous clients who did well in treatment. With the assistance of NIH SBIR funding, we
plan to improve the success rates of children in the child welfare system with an innovative, scientifically-
derived tool called “Placement Success Predictor” to guide level-of-care decision-making. This product will use
machine learning algorithms to predict individualized outcomes for children and adolescents in a particular
placement type. During the Phase I project, we developed and validated machine learning models to predict
the probability of each youth’s success within placement types and conducted usability testing of a prototype to
assess potential barriers to implementation. The likelihood of success recommendations provided by the
machine learning models developed for the “Placement Success Predictor” clinical decision-making support
tool were associated with improved youth well-being (i.e., those children that were placed in the Placement
Success Predictor-recommended placement had four times higher success rates). Potential future users found
the prototype of this tool easy to use. The machine learning models appear to distinguish clients who will do
well in various placement types and suggest that only 10% of clients would be successful in higher-cost level of
care. With the Family First Prevention Act, states are now required to pay the average $88,000 per year to
keep a child in residential care if that high level of care is not authorized. We submit this tool could help
improve overall outcomes and reduce healthcare costs when and if high-cost residential care options are
judiciously provided to children who are most likely to benefit from them. In Phase II we propose to develop this
flexible program to generate placement recommendations per client based on automatically updated custom,
site-specific machine learning prediction models then assess its efficacy and effectiveness.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
This program is focused on developing a disease-modifying drug for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) by advancing our
lead compound into clinical development. There are no disease-modifying small molecule drugs for AD, and the
prevalence of AD is increasing worldwide. This program is progressing to fill this need with a disease modifying
drug that, if successful, will have a tremendous impact on the more than 6.7 million Americans who currently
have AD (projected to be 13.8 million by 2060) and their caregivers, and will help reduce the current cost of $345
billion (projected to be $1.1 trillion by 2050) to our nation (Alzheimer's Association 2023 Alzheimer's Disease
Facts and Figures). Key requirements for treating early-stage AD include safe, efficacious, and cost-effective
therapeutic interventions. This small molecule, CNS drug-like lead significantly fulfills these requirements based
on our preliminary results. This highly differentiated tau self-association inhibitor targets tau self-association at
the beginning of the tau aggregation cascade. Small molecules were screened and optimized using in vitro
assays to select molecules that inhibit the formation of tau oligomers from tau monomers. In vitro pharmacology
studies and pharmacokinetic (PK) studies in mice were used to select a lead compound for evaluation of in vivo
efficacy. Preventive and therapeutic studies in two mouse models of tauopathy, representing tau aggregation in
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and four-repeat-tau tauopathies, demonstrated proof-of-concept and supported the
selection of this compound for further development. Methods development and manufacture of 1.61 kg of the
lead compound was completed for non-clinical safety studies. GMP manufacture of a 2.8 kg batch of drug
substance for initial clinical studies was completed, and pre-formulation studies for development of drug product
were completed. The IND was submitted (June 1, 2022) for first in human (FIH) studies that initiated in early
2023. The awarded Phase 1a study is a double-blind, randomized, three-part study designed to evaluate the
safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of the tau self-association inhibitor, in single ascending doses, multiple
ascending doses, and single doses in healthy elderly. This Supplement is to cover unanticipated incremental
costs related to project delays directly attributable to FDA requests for additional toxicology data on the
compound prior to progressing to higher doses in human volunteers. The Aims of this one-year supplement are
as follows: Aim 1. GMP Manufacture of additional batches of capsules, at two different strengths, using
established process and formulation to provide additional clinical supplies. It is urgent that these activities be
supported and started as soon as possible as currently available clinical supplies will reach their expiry date prior
to the anticipated date of completion of clinical activities. Any delay in providing this support will result in a delay
to completing clinical activities for the studies supported by this grant.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Despite prevalent use of anti-platelet and anti-lipid therapies, stroke remains the third major cause of death
and is the leading cause of adult disability in the US with an estimated cost in the range of $34 billion
annually. Approximately 20% of the annual 795,000 stroke patients die within one year and 15-30% are
permanently disabled. Antiplatelet therapy is mainly used for primary prevention of acute ischemic stroke in
cerebrovascular disease. Bioactive fatty acids are a new class of molecular targets that hold great
therapeutic potential because of their diverse role as signaling molecules that regulate metabolism and
inflammation. The oxidation of arachidonic acid by 12-LOX results in the production of a number of bioactive
lipids including the metabolite 12(S)-HETE. The lipid receptor GPR31, an orphan class A GPCR, is a 12(S)-
HETE receptor recently shown to be involved in inflammatory signaling. We recently discovered that GPR31
mediates 12(S)-HETE prothrombotic signaling in platelets and promotes glutamate-induced oxidative
toxicity in neuronal cells. Therefore, we propose that targeting GPR31 may provide a therapeutic path
towards development of a safe and effective antiplatelet therapy that is coupled with secondary
neuroprotective effects for mitigating against the acute neurologic sequela of stroke to provide a more
effective and safer alternative option or adjunct to fibrinolytic therapy. We have recently succeeded in
identifying the first effective GPR31 antagonist using our cell-penetrating, membrane-tethered, Pepducin
technology to be validated in these preclinical IND-enabling studies as an anti-platelet and anti-stroke
agent. We show here that this i3-loop derived GPR31 lipopeptide has potent antiplatelet activity and nearly
completely suppresses arterial thrombosis without an effect on hemostasis in mice. Preliminary data with
the GPR310 pepducin shows a highly significant reduction in stroke infarct area in mice similar to the
protective effect of Gpr31-deficiency. Furthermore, we provide evidence for a direct neuroprotective effect of
the GPR310 pepducin on HT22 neuronal cells subjected to glutamate mediated oxidative stress. The goal
of this Phase 2 STTR project is to develop the GPR310 pepducin as a collaborative effort between Oasis
Pharmaceuticals (Lexington, MA), Tufts Medical Center (Boston, MA) that would provide a robust IND data
package required to advance the initial commercial development of the first GPR31 inhibitor as a dual
antiplatelet, anti-stroke drug. This drug development program would establish the scientific merit of the
GPR31 target by accomplishing the major milestones at the end of 2 years of GLP safety/pharmacology
and efficacy in stroke models ± thrombolytic therapy to support a Phase I first-in-human clinical trial.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) still is the leading cause of death in the United States. The demand for novel
treatments lead to the recent discovery of proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin 9 (PCSK9), which promotes the
degradation of low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) to increase atherogenic lipoprotein LDL cholesterol (LDL-
C) levels. Many treatments targeting PCSK9 have been developed but have limited efficacy in lowing LDL-
C. This proposal fills the critical knowledge gap by challenging the underlying presumption that RXRα is essential
to regulate the transcription of PCSK9 in the liver of nonalcoholic fatty liver diseases (NAFLD) patients. RXRα is
the core nuclear receptor, which always is considered to constitutively forms heterodimerization with other
nuclear receptors. Our preliminary data showed that hepatic depletion of RXRα leads to hepatic lipid
accumulation and PCSK9 induction, which can be abolished by AAV8-mediated hepatic overexpression of RXRα.
Consistently, we observed the increased cholesterol and LDL-C in the plasma of RXRα hepatocyte-specific
knockout (hepKO) mice, and hepatic overexpression of RXRα can significantly reduce the plasma cholesterol
and LDL-C levels. These preliminary data bring two scientific questions needed to be determined in this proposal:
1) why RXRα deficiency has primary effects on the PPARα signaling pathway; 2) how RXRα regulates PCSK9
expression in the liver. To find answers, we focus on elucidating the effects of RXRα protein post-translational
modification (PTM) on managing the partnership with PPARα and regulating PCSK9. Recently, we identified a
previously unrecognized acetylation residue of RXRα, which controls the heterodimerization between RXRα and
PPARα. The inhibitory effects of RXRα constitutively acetylated mutant further indicate that acetylation of RXRα
is essential for preventing the induction of PCSK9 in the liver of RXRα hepKO mice. Our data are the first to
show that RXRα is acetylated by CBP, and TNFα, the inflammatory cytokine presented in the NALFD liver,
impairs the CBP-mediated acetylation of RXRα. Interestingly, we also observed the decreased acetylation of
RXRα in the liver of high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice and human NAFLD patients. These results suggest a central
hypothesis that RXRα acetylation is required for regulating the PPARα-mediated transcription of PCSK9 in the
liver, and impaired RXRα acetylation in the NAFLD liver results in the increased cholesterol and LDL-C. We will
test this hypothesis with the following two aims: Aim 1: Determine the molecular mechanism by which RXRα
regulates the transcription of PCSK9 in the liver; Aim 2: Determine if and the extent to which RXRα acetylation
is a resilience factor to prevent the induction of PCSK9 and cholesterol in the fatty liver. Successful completion
of studies proposed in this proposal will identify the mechanisms by which acetylated RXRα coordinates with
PPARα to regulate PCSK9 transcription and prevent obesity-promoted hypercholesterolemia. This identification
will allow for the development of new alternative strategies for attenuating PCSK9 induction in the NAFLD liver,
which will help mitigate CVD risk, an NIH's mission directive.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：ABSTRACT: The major goal of this proposal is to investigate the potential for teixobactin, our newly discovered
antibiotic, to treat respiratory infections. As reported in 2019 by the CDC, pneumonia caused by drug resistant
Streptococcus pneumoniae, as well as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), are considered
serious threats. In addition, respiratory bacterial co-infections with Covid-19 have recently been recognized as a
significant problem. Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis are two other respiratory pathogens
particularly problematic in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and are common causes of
community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP).
 The most remarkable, and unexpected property of teixobactin is the lack of any detectable resistance to
this compound. Teixobactin hits two related targets—lipid II, precursor of peptidoglycan and lipid III, precursor of
wall teichoic acid. These highly conserved targets are not mutable—they are not proteins and are not directly
coded by DNA. Since our discovery of teixobactin, we and others have failed to generate resistant mutants in
any species including S. aureus, Mycobacterium tuberculosis or Bacillus anthracis. Teixobactin is highly
efficacious in animal models of thigh, lung and blood infections. Animal infection models predict that the human
dose of teixobactin for acute skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI) will be very low (≤1 mg/kg/day), which
is advantageous, as a low dose may minimize side effects and reduce manufacturing costs.
 Teixobactin is in preclinical development as an intravenous (IV) drug for treating skin infections caused
by pathogens such as MRSA. A pre-Investigational New Drug (IND) meeting with FDA was held in December
2018 whereby the FDA generally agreed with our development plan. An IND submission for ABSSSI is planned
for 2022.
 In this project, Aim 1 will produce enough teixobactin for all the proposed studies. Aim 2 will conduct
efficacy and PK/PD studies in animal models of pneumonia. Aim 3 will test in vitro susceptibility, bactericidal
activity, post antibiotic effect (PAE) and resistance in recent clinical isolates from respiratory infections. Aim 4
will prepare and submit an IND application for intravenous treatment of a respiratory infection. Aim 5 will explore
alternative routes of TXB administration (inhalation and intramuscular delivery), which would be particularly
useful for outpatient treatment of respiratory and other infections. With successful completion of these projects,
we will have demonstrated the promise of teixobactin for treating drug resistant respiratory infections and
explored more convenient routes of TXB administration.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
NovaSterilis, Inc. intends to develop and commercialize its novel sterilization platform based on supercritical carbon
dioxide (scCO2) and powerful sterilant, NovaKill™ for the pharmaceutical market – NovaAPI™. Sterilization of drug
substances (or active pharmaceutical ingredients; APIs) and drug products is a challenging application due to the
complexities of many drugs and biologics and the minimal compatibility of current sterilization modalities (e.g., steam,
radiation, ethylene oxide). Sterilization in the pharmaceutical industry is typically reserved only for drug substances that
move onto final assembly (i.e., aseptic processing and packaging), which does not provide the level of protection of
sterilization. Products intended to be sterile should be terminally sterilized in their final container whenever possible
(referred to as terminal sterilization) according to the FDA. However, there are very few drug products that utilize terminal
sterilization, and with respect to drug products in sealed containers (e.g., lyophilized drugs or formulated drugs) or
prefilled syringes, the only option for drug companies is to use aseptic processing for final assembly of these products,
which is a time consuming and resource heavy process. While the global sterilization services market for drugs is significant
at roughly $6 billion USD, offering solutions to drug manufacturers for terminally sterilizing drug containing end products
would be a game changer. The global prefilled syringe market alone is estimated to be $5.4 billion USD by the end of 2021,
and currently, the only solution for final assembly of these products is through aseptic processing. This represents a
significant opportunity for the NovaSterilis NovaAPI™ solution, with the potential for enormous upside in providing safer
products, eliminating the need for aseptic processing for process-compatible products and expanding on the number and
type of drug substances/products that can be terminally sterilized.
Previous research results support continued development of the NovaSterilis platform for sterilization of drug substances
and products with the potential for developing a terminal sterilization process for final drug products in vial/syringe
format. We have partnered with a global leader in sterilization services for the broader program, which should provide
significant application, customer, and market insight to the project. iFyber has proposed the following Specific Aims in this
Fast Track proposal to prepare NovaAPI™ for commercialization:
Phase I Specific Aims:
 · Aim 1: Establish a drug substance compatibility matrix for a select number of drugs using NovaAPI™
 · Aim 2: Establish baseline conditions for terminal sterilization of end products
Phase II Specific Aims:
· Aim 3: Complete assessment of sterilization validation process for SAL 10-6 for drug substances/products.
· Aim 4: Complete sterilization residuals testing following regulatory guidelines.
· Aim 5: Establish scale up process parameters and load configuration in a 100L vessel.

 C. difficile now causes more hospital-onset infections and deaths in the US than any other pathogen and is
the most important cause of healthcare-associated diarrhea among adults in industrialized countries. In 2017,
there were an estimated 462,100 combined healthcare- and community-associated C. difficile infection cases in
the US, and 20,500 in-hospital deaths. In a randomized trial, soap and water washing for 30 seconds reduced
but did not eliminate hand contamination in patients with CDI or asymptomatic carriage of C. difficile, whereas
alcohol hand hygiene had no effect. The hands of healthcare workers frequently become contaminated with C.
difficile spores, but hand washing with soap and water has only modest efficacy, and alcohol-based hand
sanitizers have essentially no efficacy against spores. Thus, there is an important unmet need for development
of effective strategies to reduce the burden of spores on hands. Given the concern that unrecognized
asymptomatic carriers contribute significantly to transmission, there is an urgent need for comprehensive
approaches applicable to persons who directly care for CDI patients, and also more generally for all hand
hygiene.
 We have developed a practical and highly innovative approach to meet this need through the development
of a sporicidal hand wash that is effective in significantly reducing C. difficile spores on skin. Our hand wash
formulation is based on the use of a new class of microstructured fluid (MSF) made with microfibrillated cellulose
which significantly enhances the removal of C. difficile spores from skin by physical and mechanical means
compared to traditional soap and water. The shear stresses generated at the skin surface during washing with
MSF are 10 to 100 times higher when compared to what can be obtained with traditional soap and water.
Importantly, we have recently discovered that when the microstructured fluid is made with the inclusion of novel
and skin-safe sporicidal ingredients at neutral pH, we are able to achieve ∼3.5 log reduction of C. difficile spores
from porcine skin in 30 seconds according to comprehensive testing. This discovery constitutes a significant
improvement over conventional soap and water, and in principal, should result in high assurance prevention of
transmitting C. difficile infection. This new discovery is significant since current alcohol-based hand sanitizers
are ineffective against C. difficile spores. This project is focused on: 1) optimizing and finalizing the MSF hand
washing formulation based on testing with an established skin model with the goal of achieving >3 log reduction
of C. diff spores and important HAI infections from skin; 2) manufacturing the MSF hand wash product under
GMP, performing compatibility/stability studies and developing quality control requirements; and 3) testing the
safety and tolerability of the MSF hand wash on skin as required by FDA.

Sex differences in the development and prevalence of mental illnesses are widespread, suggesting that the
factors that promote disease risk and resilience may be distinct in men and women. The neurobiological
mechanisms underlying this possibility are poorly understood, however, because the vast majority of pre-
clinical animal research has been conducted in males. In addition, the behavioral outcome measures used to
understand learned fear have focused predominantly on passive, or freezing behavior. We recently identified
an active, escape-like conditioned fear response in rats (“darting”) that occurred almost exclusively in females
and was associated with an augmented response to the foot shock unconditioned stimulus. A better
understanding of potentially sexually dimorphic mechanisms that drive this behavior could open new avenues
for treatment of disorders that are more prevalent in women, like PTSD. We have collected preliminary data
implicating the neural projections from the anterior cingulate (ACC) to ventrolateral periaqueductal gray
(vlPAG) as a potentially novel, sex-dependent circuit that integrates sensory pain information into conditioned
and unconditioned fear responses. We propose here to explore sex differences in this circuit at both the
structural and functional level. First, we will use a retrograde tracer to perform a quantitative mapping of ACC-
vlPAG projections, then we will characterize the post-synaptic vlPAG targets of ACC afferents using trans-
synaptic viral approaches combined with fluorescent immunohistochemistry. Next, we will record ACC-vlPAG
activity during fear conditioning using fiber photometry to correlate activity to stimulus presentation and
behavioral responses, and finally test the causal role this circuit plays in driving darting using circuit-specific
chemogenetic techniques. Together, these studies can provide insight into sex-dependent circuit mechanisms
underlying individual differences in stress resilience and vulnerability.

Enzymes play a critical role in biological processes, and measurements of enzyme activity in cells and tissues
are foundational to our understanding of physiology and pathophysiology. Measuring enzyme activity in vivo
provides context within the intact living tissue, enabling organ- or organism-level understanding of the spatial
and temporal differences in enzyme activity. However, most research regarding enzyme activity has been lim-
ited to in vitro and ex vivo methods due to our inability to observe enzyme activity with high sensitivity and high
resolution in deep tissues. Fluorescence-based techniques offer a non-invasive, high resolution look at molec-
ular or morphological information but are often hampered by limited tissue penetration. Imaging in optical tis-
sue windows in the short-wave infrared (SWIR; 900-1700 nm) enables deeper tissue penetration and improved
resolution than visible or NIR light due to reduced absorption and scattering by biological materials. Even at
ideal wavelengths, photoluminescence imaging requires incident light to excite the fluorophore, resulting in
light attenuation both going in and out of the tissue. Luciferase-based bioluminescence imaging eliminates the
need for external excitation, thereby reducing the distance light must traverse through tissue as well as elimi-
nating autofluorescence. While bioluminescence is preferred for many in vivo imaging applications, there are
no reports of SWIR-emitting luciferases, limiting this approach to less preferred visible wavelengths or NIR
probes emitting < 750 nm. In this proposal, bioluminescence energy transfer (BRET) from luciferases to SWIR-
emitting semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) generate self-illuminating SWIR-emitting contrast agents. We pro-
pose the development of the first enzyme-sensing, SWIR-emitting, self-illuminating quantum dots
(QDs). Multiplexing reference and enzyme-cleavable probes for ratiometric in vivo imaging will calibrate the
enzyme activity to the local concentration of probes and is facilitated by our hyperspectral SWIR preclinical im-
ager. We will test our sensor by visualizing the activity of MMP-16, a cell-surface biomarker of liver disease
progression that is correlated with fibrosis, hepatitis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). To test our hypothe-
sis that dual probe imaging with self-illuminating, SWIR-emitting contrast agents will enable spatial and tem-
poral enzyme activity maps, we will design, characterize, and optimize the BRET probes in vitro. In parallel, we
will use tissue phantoms to compare the signal-to-noise ratios (S/N) and image resolution using BRET vs. pho-
toluminescence excitation mechanisms. Finally, we will demonstrate the functionality of our sensor in phan-
toms and in a mouse model of liver cirrhosis. Successful completion of this project would result in a sensor ca-
pable of reporting MMP-16 activity deep in the liver with high resolution and high sensitivity. Demonstrating this
new way to take non-invasive, high resolution images of enzyme activity in deep tissues will enable a wide ar-
ray of new studies into the role of enzymes in pathophysiology by the scientific community.

The overarching goal of this project is to improve the reproducibility of quantitative MRI (qMRI).
Secondary goals are to enhance its sensitivity and specificity, and to enable its utilization in clinical
routine imaging by reducing the scan time. Successful completion of this project will help towards the
fulfillment of qMRI's promise to objectify the radiologists' analysis and to improve the comparability of
different scans, which is much needed in the age of large multi-center studies, artificial intelligence, and
precision medicine.
It is well-known that estimates of spin relaxation times for biological tissue vary substantially throughout
the literature, in particular if different pulse sequences are used for their measurement. Our central
hypothesis is that this variability is a result of model oversimplifications, as un-modeled effects bias the
parameter estimates and this bias depends on the sequence. Simple models are commonly chosen for
in vivo qMRI to keep the scan time clinically feasible. This project aims to overcome this variability by
removing the most severe model oversimplifications, and we will enable an efficient encoding of the
more complex model with the "hybrid state," a spin-ensemble state whose discovery we recently
reported in Nature Communications Physics. Our preliminary data suggests that the hybrid state allows
us to disentangle different T1-relaxation paths, on a voxel-by-voxel basis and within a clinically feasible
scan time, and we find that magnetization transfer plays a dominant role in T1-relaxation in brain white
matter.
The three specific aims concern the physics, bio-medical, and the engineering aspects of the project
and will jointly establish the proposed model and hybrid-state pulse sequence for robust and fast
quantitative MRI. We aim to provide an improved understanding of multi-component T1-relaxation in
biological tissue and the clinical implications thereof, as well as to develop tools for quantifying the
developed biomarkers in a clinical imaging setting.
While this work is relevant to the entire field of biomedical MR, the project focuses on neuroimaging,
where the relevant biophysics in best understood; and we will use multiple sclerosis as a test-vehicle
for our model and pulse sequence, as the bio-medical interpretation of the physical parameters is well
understood.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
Although the neuromodulators dopamine (DA) and acetylcholine (ACh) are extensively implicated in the
pathogenesis and treatment of neuropsychiatric diseases, their effects on the activity of brain circuits are typically
studied separately, leaving their ability to dynamically cooperate in supporting brain function and dysfunction
incompletely understood. This is a significant limitation as (1) neuropsychiatric disorders typically involve
disturbances in multiple modulators, (2) existing therapies rarely target a single modulatory system, and (3) the
physiological actions of modulators are fundamentally inter-dependent, since many co-exist in individual brain
regions and converge on overlapping cells to stimulate receptors that complement, antagonize, or synergize with
one another. An influential hypothesis in the field of basal ganglia research is that ACh gates or modifies the
physiological actions of DA in the striatum – a subcortical forebrain region important for learning and motivating
goal-directed behaviors. However, we still lack a clear understanding of precisely when, how and over what time
course ACh interacts with DA to differentially affect striatal activity and behavior. We recently discovered that
ACh levels in the striatum of mice constantly undergo large, subsecond fluctuations that are temporally
coordinated with DA and modulated in amplitude depending on behavioral state. The main goal of this proposal
is therefore to build of this observation and to test the hypothesis that DA acts in concert with ACh, such that the
precise timing and amplitude of subsecond ACh transients relative to DA is key for deciphering the effects of DA
on striatal circuits and behavior. We will do so by first monitoring the dynamics of DA and ACh with subsecond
precision from the striatum of mice engaged in reward-based behaviors using dual-color photometry of red and
green DA and ACh sensors (Aim 1). Next, we will mechanistically dissect the functional impact of ACh on DA
release and on striatal activity using photometric imaging combined with genetic and pharmacological
manipulations (Aim 2). Lastly, we will establish that ACh transients can gate the effects of DA on motivation and
learning using calibrated optogenetic manipulations (Aim 3). Together, the proposed work will provide crucial
mechanistic insights into the structure and function of coordinated DA and ACh dynamics in the striatum of mice
and pave the way for future investigations into how the disruption or potentiation of such coordination in humans
contributes to the development or treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Project summary: Ants are social insects that live in colonies of morphologically and physiologically different
individuals that are essentially identical genetically, making ants an attractive system to study epigenetic
phenomena. Ant colonies contain many workers that perform most tasks but do not lay eggs, while queens are
solely responsible for reproduction. Remarkably, queens live up to 10X longer than workers, in sharp contrast
with most animals in which high reproduction leads to shortened lifespan. The jumping ant Harpegnathos
saltator exhibits a high degree of aging plasticity: In the absence of the queen, some workers can become
pseudo-queens called gamergates. Gamergates dramatically change their behavior, produce eggs, reconfigure
their brain and most dramatically, have a 5X lifespan extension. Remarkably, when placed in the presence of a
genuine queen, gamergates transition back into workers with an accompanying shortened lifespan. We
established Harpegnathos as a model system that can be manipulated with CRISPR/Cas9, providing a unique
opportunity to study the molecular mechanisms that control aging, as well as the crosstalk between aging and
reproduction.
 Using a combination of transcriptomics as well as both ex vivo and in vivo pharmacological manipulations, we
discovered that gamergates have an elevated production of Insulin accompanied by differential regulation of the
two branches of the Insulin signaling pathway (IIS) in target tissues. The MAPK branch of IIS is activated in the
gamergate fat body and ovary, while the AKT branch is repressed by extracellular “anti-Insulin” proteins, ImpL2.
As MAPK activity is required for egg-laying, we hypothesize that repression of the AKT branch contributes to the
dramatically extended longevity in gamergates.
 We now propose to investigate the molecular mechanism of ImpL2 function and test its role in aging. First,
we will identify the source and organismal distribution of ImpL2, and then experimentally modulate its levels and
mutate ImpL2 to examine the effect(s) on IIS and increased metabolism for egg formation. Furthermore, we will
explore the molecular interactions of ImpL2 and the mechanisms that lead to the specific inhibition of the AKT
(but not MAPK) IIS pathway. Next, we will test the effect of ImpL2 on aging in manipulated animals, assessing a
panel of aging biomarkers and extend our investigations to another anti-Insulin protein, ALS. Moreover, tissue-
specific manipulation of ImpL2 expression in Drosophila will address its potentially conserved effect on
reproduction and lifespan in a powerful model system. Finally, we will extend our study to the brain remodeling
events that accompany and orchestrate the social transition. We will perform single-cell mRNA sequencing of
the different social groups/ages to survey age-associated changes in the Harpegnathos brain and identify
candidate regulators responsible for delayed aging in gamergates. We will exploit the transcriptomic data to test
how specific genetic functions modulate brain circuits and aging.

Family caregivers of people with dementia have to decide between tube feeding and hand feeding when
persistent eating problems arise. This decision can be difficult for Chinese-American dementia caregivers, due
to the interplay of culture, potential absence of a patient’s advance directive, poor understanding of dementia,
and lack of knowledge on the risks and benefits of tube feeding. There is a high prevalence of tube feeding
among Chinese older adults with advanced dementia; however, tube feeding does not have health benefits for
older adults with advanced dementia, and may in fact be related to increased risk and discomfort. Shared
decision-making is a process by which patients, family members, and healthcare providers work together to
create care plans that balance clinical evidence and patient preferences and values with risks and expected
outcomes. Current clinical discussions on feeding tubes rarely meet this standard. Limited research has been
conducted to improve decision quality regarding feeding options among Chinese-American dementia caregivers.
This pathway to Independence Award (K99/R00) will give Dr. Pei the training, mentoring, and skills necessary
to conduct intervention research to improve decision-making about feeding options for dementia patients in
Chinese American communities. The goal of this study is to develop and pilot test a culturally adapted decision
aid intervention to support Chinese American dementia caregivers in decision making about feeding options. To
become an independent investigator in improving end-of-life decision making, Dr. Pei will receive training and
mentoring in four areas: (1) deepening the knowledge of end-of-life decision-making, (2) gaining additional
training in qualitative methods research, (3) developing proficiency in clinical trial design and (4) enhancing
professional developmental skills in grant writing, research team management, and leadership. In the K99 phase,
the candidate proposes two aims. Aim 1: Conduct individual interviews with family caregivers and healthcare
professionals to inform the adaptation of an existing intervention; Aim 2: Develop, refine, and acceptability test
the culturally adapted decision aid. In the R00 phase, the candidate aims to refine and evaluate the efficacy of
the decision aid in a pilot randomized controlled trial among 60 Chinese American dementia caregivers (Aim 3).
By the end of the R00 award, Dr. Pei will complete the transition from observational and explanatory research to
behavioral intervention work and submit an R01 proposal. Her strong mentoring team, well-established
collaboration with community organizations in New York City, and ideal environment of research support and
resources at New York University will help Dr. Pei become a successful independent investigator in improving
end-of-life decision making for older adults with dementia.

Chronic widespread pain (CWP) is a chronic pain subtype that affects multiple body sites, and is strongly
associated with poor function and disability. Although CWP is highly prevalent in adults with obesity, CWP
outcomes are disproportionately worse in non-Hispanic Black (NH Black) and Hispanic/Latino/a/x adults. Thus,
the obesity-related health disparity in CWP could augment existing racial and ethnic pain disparities in these
populations. Bariatric surgery is often prescribed to treat obesity and musculoskeletal pain comorbidities.
However, there is significant variability in weight loss and pain trajectories after bariatric surgery. Moreover, many
patients experience recurrent or unresolved pain after bariatric surgery that can inhibit weight loss or facilitate
weight regain. There are critical gaps in our knowledge of the primary driver(s) of CWP outcomes and how
driver(s) of CWP respond to weight loss, particularly in racial and ethnically diverse groups. As such, the main
objective of the proposed mentored project for the Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development
Award (K23) is to fill these knowledge gaps by: 1) comprehensively characterizing pain at rest and movement-
evoked pain (MEP) in NH Black and Hispanic/Latino/a/x adults after bariatric surgery, and 2) identifying potential
key driver(s) of intra-group variability in the resolution or maintenance of pain after bariatric surgery. We will
focus on pain sensitivity, joint motion and mechanical loading biosignatures, and psychosocial factors. The aims
proposed in this K23 application feature highly innovative methods that synergize mechanism-based pain
phenotyping with obesity and health disparities research approaches. The methodologies employed represent a
substantive departure from static, self-reported pain assessment to the integration of rigorous assessment and
measurement multiple dimensions of pain at rest and MEP using precise quantification of nociceptive processing
and joint motion and loading biosignatures in ethnically diverse populations. For the K23, I have assembled a
strong interdisciplinary and multicultural cadre of highly successful clinical, basic, and translational scientists who
have a strong and demonstrable commitment to the successful implementation and completion of my career
development plan and research project milestones. The primary training goals that are the linchpin of my
research training and career development are: 1) developing expertise in the integration of weight loss and
lifestyle change evaluations with pain phenotyping data, 2) to develop and implement clinical trial designs that
identify and address pain disparities, and 3) to enhance training in advanced statistical methods to inform clinical
trial design to examine pain disparities. New York University (NYU) and the University of Florida are very strong
incubators of pain, obesity, and rehabilitation research. Furthermore, these institutions are robust research
environments that have the resources available to me to build on my previous training to foster independence in
research that is focused on improving pain management in racially and ethnically diverse adults with obesity.

The proposed K01 Mentored Research Scientist Development Award will provide the applicant with advanced
training and skills to launch an independent research program focused on developing and adapting culturally-
sensitive interventions to reduce disparities in the psychological burden of cancer among ethnic minority
cancer patients and survivors. This K01 proposal seeks to culturally-adapt and test the feasibility of a writing-
based intervention, expressive helping, and its efficacy on psychological well-being, quality of life (QoL), and
cancer-related fatigue (CRF) among Chinese American cancer survivors. Expressive helping integrates two
distinct areas of research showing that expressive writing (i.e., a writing intervention that facilitates emotional
disclosure) and helping others (e.g., support giving) improves psychological well-being among healthy and
clinical populations. In expressive helping, participants write about their cancer experiences, disclosing their
emotions and providing encouragement and guidance, with the knowledge that their narratives will be shared
with and used as a resource for other cancer survivors. Aim 1 of the study is to conduct a qualitative study to
culturally adapt the expressive helping intervention for Chinese American cancer survivors. 24 In-depth
interviews and 3 focus group discussions with Chinese American cancer survivors and key informants will
inform the adaptation of the expressive helping intervention by focusing on material development and
recruitment, implementation, and retention strategies. In Aim 2, a mixed methods randomized controlled trial of
expressive helping will be conducted to test the feasibility and preliminary efficacy on psychological well-being,
QoL, and CRF outcomes (N = 108). Participants will complete follow-up outcome questionnaires at 1-, 3-, and
6-month follow-ups. A subset of the participants (n = 20) will complete post-intervention qualitative interviews
to examine how writing may have influenced their psychosocial adjustment. The proposed study is well-suited
to the expertise the applicant brings to the project, and well-suited to be conducted in New York City (NYC), as
NYC has the largest Chinese population of any city outside of Asia. The K01 award will facilitate the applicant’s
transition from conducting basic research on culture and emotion regulation with healthy Asian Americans to
intervention research with minority cancer survivors. It will help build his long-term career goal in implementing
evidence-based interventions to reduce cancer health disparities in the psychological burden of cancer among
minority cancer survivors. As part of this award, the applicant will train in cancer survivorship, community-
based participatory research (CBPR), qualitative research, and mixed methods intervention research by
conducting the proposed study in collaboration with Drs. Chau Trinh-Shevrin (primary mentor), Qian Lu (co-
mentor), Jennifer Leng (co-mentor), Marjorie Kagawa-Singer (consultant), and Annette Stanton (consultant).

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
Animals can exhibit goal-directed behaviors in novel environments, despite limited experience
with them. How does the brain make and use inferences about the underlying statistics and
generative structure of environments to guide behavior? The field of reinforcement learning refers
to this capacity as “model-based” reasoning, meaning that it relies on an internal model of the
structure of the world. Critically, this internal model can be used to flexibly estimate the best
actions by mental simulation or planning, without direct experience. In contrast, in “model-free”
reinforcement learning, an agent chooses the best action based on direct experience, without
explicit knowledge of the underlying sequential transition structure of a task or environment.
 Model-based and model-free mechanisms coexist in the brain and are mediated by distinct
circuits, although the neural circuit mechanisms by which the brain arbitrates between these
decision systems remains unknown. Theoretical and behavioral studies suggest that human
brains use the system that yields value estimates with the lowest uncertainty. The lateral
orbitofrontal cortex (lOFC) is a compelling candidate to perform arbitration because while it is
implicated in model-based reasoning, for instance by enabling inferences about hidden task
states, it lies upstream of the dorsal striatum, which is critical for both model-based and model-
free decision making. Intriguingly, we have found that lOFC neurons project exclusively to the
dorsolateral striatum (DLS), a region critical for model-free behavior, and not the dorsomedial
striatum (DMS), which is critical for model-based behavior. We hypothesize that projection
specific neural circuits in lOFC arbitrate between these systems by suppressing the model-free
system.
 I will use state-of-the-art viral, electrophysiological, and computational methods to
determine whether DLS-projecting lOFC neurons mediate uncertainty-based arbitration between
decision-making systems (Aim 1) and characterize the underlying circuit logic that supports
arbitration (Aim 2). By optogenetically tagging DLS-projecting lOFC neurons I will selectively
characterize and perturb their activity while monitoring the behavioral strategy rats use in a task
with latent structure. To determine how arbitration is instantiated in the dorsal striatum I will
optogenetically activate OFC→DLS neurons while recording from different genetic cell types in
the striatum, in vivo and in vitro. We predict that OFC→DLS neurons enable model-based
behavior by activating inhibitory interneurons to suppress the DLS and the model-free system.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Project Summary: This study will address the need for motivational strategies to achieve therapeutic levels of
task-repetition in upper extremity rehabilitation post-stroke. To this end, we are investigating optimal strategies
for utilizing music to increase motor activity, improve affect and increase functional activity in brain areas
related to motor recovery post-stroke. While most empirical studies of music-based interventions utilize fixed
music-playing tasks in which participants play a specified music sequence, the clinical practice of music
therapy involves improvisation, allowing the music to be adjusted in the moment to reflect the emotional, social
and physical needs of participants. We have therefore designed a study to characterize the effect of
improvisation within music-based interventions for upper extremity rehabilitation. In Aim 1 we will characterize
the motor, affective and physiological correlates of music improvisation for adults with post-stroke hemiparesis.
We hypothesize that the increased improvisation will be associated with increased motor activity (measured by
accelerometry) and increased affect (measured by self-report surveys following each condition and
physiological arousal). In Aim 2 we will assess the neural mechanisms of music improvisation by using fMRI.
We hypothesize that increased affect and motor output will be supported by increased functional connectivity
between core reward, motivation and emotion-related subcortical regions and cortical motor and frontal areas.
These findings will lay the foundation for optimal musi-based interventions that capitalize on improvisation to
maximize motor recovery and minimize attrition rate.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Project Summary
 Dopamine is an important neuromodulator that mediates learning from previous outcomes (“retrospective”
learning) by encoding reward prediction errors — the difference between experienced and expected rewards.
However, recent work has suggested that dopamine might use the prefrontal cortex to encode more abstract
prediction errors, such as errors about the hidden state of a task or environment. The exact circuit mechanisms
underlying these abstract hidden-state prediction errors remains unclear. This proposal has two major goals.
First, I will characterize dopamine activity related to hidden-state inference in rats performing a task with partially
observable states. Second, I will identify the circuit mechanisms that generate dopamine state prediction errors
in this task. I will use computational modeling and state-of-the-art genetic and viral tools, including fiber
photometry to measure dopamine activity and projection-specific chemogenetic silencing of prefrontal cortex, to
address these goals. I will measure dopamine activity both at the level of cell-body calcium dynamics, as well as
at the level of axonal release, which can be dissociated. This proposal will describe the multi-regional neural
circuits that underlie the acquisition and maintenance of abstract representations of the environment. The results
will provide insight into the pathology and treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders, which are characterized by
disrupted reward processing.
 My co-sponsors at New York University (NYU), Dr. Christine Constantinople and Dr. Paul Glimcher, have
complimentary experience in behavioral and systems neuroscience experiments in rats, and computational
modeling of decision-making, respectively. The training I will receive will allow me to pursue truly integrative
research that involves the close interplay between experiments and theory. The strong, collaborative
environment at NYU makes it an ideal place for me to pursue these research goals. My training plan provides a
detailed strategy for acquiring the necessary skills from a team of co-mentors with extensive, proven expertise
in the relevant techniques. Technical training, as well as frequent data presentations, attendance of professional
courses, seminars, and conferences, and development of my writing and leadership skills will equip me to
complete the proposed research, and transition to a post-doctoral position in my field of interest.

Sensing and processing information through signaling cascades is an essential part of cellular life. A few
signaling cascades such as the MAP kinase and Hippo pathways are ubiquitous among eukaryotes yet
perform different functions across organisms. Although these pathways are well-studied, how they evolve to
take on new functions and adapt to new inputs remains poorly understood. The Mitotic Exit Network (MEN), a
Ras-like GTPase signaling cascade and yeast homolog of the Hippo pathway, provides a unique opportunity to
study this question. In the MEN, the same core signaling components operate in distinct manners under
different developmental trajectories. During yeast mitosis which occurs through an asymmetric cell division
called budding, the MEN is scaffolded onto the spindle pole bodies (SPB, the yeast equivalent of centrosomes)
and responds to spindle position through its GTPase Tem1. During meiosis, where budding is suppressed and
thus no need to sense spindle position, MEN signaling is no longer organized at the SPBs, and it is unclear
whether Tem1 is still required for MEN activation and what signal it may respond to. To understand the
adaptation of the MEN under distinct cellular contexts, this proposal will test the hypothesis that this adaptation
is enabled partially by different activation mechanisms of the MEN kinase Cdc15, the effector kinase of Tem1,
between mitosis and meiosis (Aim 1). In contrast to the drastic change in spatial organization of the MEN core
components between mitosis and meiosis, the effector protein of the MEN, the phosphatase Cdc14, remains
sequestered in the nucleolus prior to activation both in mitosis and meiosis. In fact, this nucleolar localization of
Cdc14 is conserved from yeast to human. Sequestration of Cdc14 in the nucleolus could function either 1) to
ensure tight inhibition of Cdc14’s phosphatase activity prior to activation or 2) to localize Cdc14 to
dephosphorylate specific substrates in the nucleolus. To uncover the selection pressure that maintains this
conserved nucleolar localization of Cdc14, this proposal will examine these two hypotheses by sequestering
Cdc14 elsewhere in the cell and characterize the consequences first in yeast and then in mammalian cells
(Aim 2). The experiments within both aims will be initiated during the K99 phase which also includes training of
the candidate on new experimental systems such as yeast meiosis and mammalian cells, as well as the
development and implementation of quantitative microscopy, proximity labeling and optogenetics. Furthermore,
the candidate has assembled an outstanding mentor team to both advise her scientifically to facilitate progress
of the project and prepare her for the transition to an independent investigator. Together, this proposal will
create a strong foundation for an independent research career in understanding the evolution/adaptation and
spatial organization of cellular signaling.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
Shortly after fertilization, a dramatic reprogramming of the genome and transcriptome occurs, enabling the
embryo to develop quickly and robustly. This is especially exemplified in the Drosophila embryo, which within a
two-hour period undergoes 13 mitotic cycles, cellularizes the blastoderm, patterns the body plan, and gets ready
for gastrulation. While the gene networks underlying these processes have been well studied, it is not clear how
they are collectively initiated, a process referred to as zygotic genome activation. Moreover, although it was
observed that DNA replication occurs before transcription, the mechanisms that control this timing are not known.
Previously, we demonstrated that a single factor, Zelda, acts globally to activate early-expressed genes. We
found that Zelda binding to CAGGTAG sites across the genome lowers nucleosome barriers at enhancers,
thereby facilitating the binding of other key transcription factors. Zelda and these other factors are present in
sub-nuclear “hubs” (discrete foci) that were seen to colocalize at enhancers. We aim to use high-resolution
microscopy to investigate the which structural features of Zelda mediate hub formation. In addition, we are
interested in the regulatory mechanisms that control the timing of transcription and DNA replication so that
conflicts between the two processes are avoided. We propose that Zelda plays a dual pioneering role: 1) to open
chromatin for the Origin Recognition Complex to load and subsequent formation of the Pre-replication Complex,
which occludes the transcriptional machinery until origins have fired, and 2) to open newly formed chromatin for
transcription to initiate. Our goal is to first define origins of replication in early embryos, and to characterize
Zelda's role in origin licensing and transcriptional initiation. Our studies will lend into how these two fundamental
processes of DNA replication and transcription are coordinated during genome activation.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：The overarching goal of my research program is to identify and characterize molecular mechanisms
responsible for stress-induced permeabilization of the mitochondrial inner membrane. In most eukaryotic
cells, mitochondria are the primary source of the energy that they provide in the form of ATP by
performing oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). OXPHOS is a two-step process. First, substrate
oxidation by the respiratory chain results in the generation of the electrical potential on the mitochondrial
inner membrane. This potential energy drives generation of ATP by the phosphorylation of ADP at the
ATP synthase complex. To prevent energy dissipation and ensure that OXPHOS is efficient mitochondrial
inner membrane permeability should be tightly controlled and maintained at low levels. Stress conditions
associated with dysregulation of calcium and ROS homeostasis can lead to an increase in mitochondrial
inner membrane permeability – a phenomenon known as Mitochondrial Permeability Transition (mPT).
mPT causes dissipation of the membrane potential and loss of mitochondrial ATP-generating capacity
leading to cell dysfunction and death. mPT is critically involved in a broad spectrum of diseases ranging
from heart attack to neurodegeneration. Prevention of mPT is highly protective against cell death and
tissue damage suggesting high therapeutics potential. However, molecular mechanisms of mPT are not
well understood, and this gap in knowledge prevents mPT from being a drug target. Over the past five
years, we demonstrated that mPT is a multifaceted phenomenon and depending on the disease type and
stress severity, it can occur through different pathways. The central goal of our research program is to
identify the link between specific molecular mechanisms of mPT and specific stress conditions. We have
already established several original animal and cell disease-relevant models causing different types of
mPT. In our approach, a variety of methods that measure the mPT and tissue damage at the organismal,
cellular and mitochondrial levels are coupled with a number of our original electrophysiological (patch-
clamp) assays that allow direct measurement of mPT at the level of mitochondrial membranes and give
us a unique opportunity to dissect and characterize its multiple identities and regulation. The results of
our study will provide a detailed understanding of one of the most critical events in cell death cascades
and will bring an essential framework for the development of therapeutically approaches that will
selectively target mPT.

Neuronal plasticity allows neurons to change the strength of their connections with each other and even to
make or break connections. Plasticity is a fundamental property of neurons that underlies numerous brain
functions such as learning and probably sleep, but it is also misregulated in diseases such as autism. Making
stable changes in neuronal connections requires transcription and translation and an activity-dependent gene
expression program is rapidly induced in response to neuronal activity. Many of the genes in this first wave of
gene expression encode transcription factors that then regulate additional genes that are more directly
involved in plasticity. Mutations in components of these activity-dependent programs have been associated
with human cognitive disorders and psychiatric diseases, showing the importance of this pathway.
We study plasticity in s-LNvs, the principal Drosophila circadian pacemaker neurons, which are ideal since
changes in the morphology of their projections are predictable and happen at defined times each day. Having
only 4 s-LNvs per brain hemisphere makes their projections easy to visualize, and we have the tools of
Drosophila genetics to alter gene expression or neuronal activity in s-LNvs, along with expression profiles. s-
LNv structural changes are driven by neuronal activity: their projections expand at dawn when s-LNvs are most
excitable, and retract around dusk when s-LNvs become hyperpolarized. s-LNvs use activity-dependent gene
expression to expand projections, ultimately activating Rac1 GTPase to regulate actin. We have identified a
second transcriptional program that is activated by neuronal hyperpolarization and/or neuronal inactivity. This
program opposes activity-dependent gene expression and leads to Rho1 GTPase activation to retract s-LNv
projections. Just like activity-dependent gene expression, the first step in hyperpolarization-dependent gene
expression is to transcribe a gene encoding a transcription factor – in this case Toy, a fly Pax6 orthologue.
In Goal 1, we propose to understand the molecular mechanism of hyperpolarization-dependent gene
expression in s-LNvs, and test if this program functions in mammals. We will also test if hyperpolarization-
dependent gene expression is important in sleep, which is associated with overall synaptic downscaling. In
Goal 2, we will study competition between the activity-dependent and hyperpolarization-dependent gene
expression programs that likely works both transcriptionally and post-transcriptionally to ensure one program
dominates. In Goal 3, we will develop a genomic-based approach to identify connections between neurons that
we predict will be broadly applicable, and also to give insights into how new connections are specified at the
molecular level. Overall, studying plasticity in s-LNvs should give a holistic view of plasticity that is broadly
relevant across neurobiology and could identify new disease risk loci.

Reducing stigma to ensure viral load (VL) suppression for women with serious mental illness (SMI) and HIV is a
global priority, including in Botswana, where the intersectional stigma of SMI, HIV and womanhood is
marginalizing in ways that impede adherence to both psychiatric medications and antiretroviral therapy (ART),
which can threaten VL suppression. We apply our novel ‘what matters most’ (WMM) approach to target
intersectional stigma faced by women with SMI and HIV in Botswana via a stigma-reduction intervention in the
high-risk transition period after discharge from an initial psychiatric hospitalization. WMM conceptualizes how
stigma is felt most acutely when people are unable to achieve ‘full personhood’ by participating in the activities
that ‘matter most’ in their local context. In prior research, we found the core value for ‘full womanhood’ in
Botswana is achieved by being the ‘foundation of the household’ and is threatened by perceived: 1)
incompetence in fulfilling the duties of a family caregiver associated with SMI and 2) promiscuity associated with
having HIV. In Botswana, family acceptance as a viable ‘family caregiver’ is also key to achieving ‘full status’ as
a woman. As such, the risks of being identified as having SMI and HIV (e.g., partner/family abandonment) can
deter psychiatric and ART treatment adherence. Promoting capabilities that ‘matter most’ for achieving ‘full
womanhood’ could enable longer-term stigma reduction after psychiatric discharge, when women are
reintegrating into their communities, and improve ART adherence and promote sustained VL suppression. Our
group-based WMM stigma intervention is co-led by a peer woman who has coped effectively with SMI and HIV
stigma. The WMM stigma intervention model was piloted among pregnant women with HIV in Botswana with
promising reductions in stigma and depressive symptoms up to 4-months postpartum. We now test whether a
WMM intervention tailored for women with SMI and HIV will reduce intersectional stigma and facilitate VL
suppression. We propose a two-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT; N=180) with a 4-month follow-up to
compare the effectiveness of 1) WMM-based intersectional stigma intervention delivered as clients transition
from psychiatric hospitalization to outpatient care (‘WMM Stigma Intervention;’ n=90); and 2) attention control
following a similar format to isolate the effects of the intervention (n=90). Because family are commonly involved
in the care of people with SMI and face severe stigma, we propose a parallel, group stigma intervention among
family members, as addressing familial stigma could facilitate treatment adherence. Finally, because
intersectional stigma is reinforced at systemic levels, we seek to empower women with SMI and HIV to influence
structural change by coleading policymaker workshops to reduce stigma among policymakers and spur
policymakers to address the unique needs of women with SMI and HIV via future policies.

 The long-term goal of our research is to develop first-in-class, protein-based inhibitors against
human bacterial pathogens by directly blocking efflux pumps. Drug resistant bacteria pose an
urgent global health challenge by reducing the effectiveness of antibiotics used to treat infections
in humans and animals. The broadest resistance mechanism against antibiotics are efflux pumps,
which transport drugs out of the cytoplasm and reduce toxicity to the organism. While it is known
that efflux pumps display broad specificity to structurally distinct compounds, the mechanisms of
polyspecific drug binding and ion-coupled transport remain unanswered questions in the field.
Given the promiscuity of efflux pump binding to structurally distinct drugs, it is also unclear
whether potent and selective efflux pump inhibitors can be designed to target specific classes of
efflux pumps. The specific goals of this project are to discover novel mechanisms of active
transport in drug resistant Staphylococcus aureus and to harness this knowledge to design
selective inhibitors toward efflux pumps. Our proposal is strongly motivated by our recent
discovery of antibody fragments (Fabs) that bind the Staphylococcus aureus efflux pump NorA
and successful determination of high-resolution cryoEM structures using the Fabs as fiduciaries.
The structures revealed that the Fabs insert a loop into the substrate binding pocket from the
extracellular side, which suggests a design path toward protein- and peptide-based inhibitors.
This interaction is facilitated by an electrostatic interaction between a positively charged arginine
on the Fab and two essential anionic residues within NorA. Building on these preliminary data,
we propose to carry out four Specific Aims. Aim 1 will develop a hybrid approach of cryo-electron
microscopy and NMR spectroscopy to comprehensively study the transport cycle of NorA. Aim 2
will seek to determine the molecular basis for polyspecific drug binding. Aim 3 will design and
characterize protein-based inhibitors that target the accessible, outward-open conformation of
NorA. Aim 4 will develop peptides that miniaturize the antibody loops observed in the binding
pocket of NorA. We have assembled an interdisciplinary team with expertise in structural biology,
protein engineering, microbiology, chemical synthesis, and computational chemistry to rapidly
answer fundamental questions about multidrug transport and inhibition of efflux pumps. All of the
approaches applied to NorA will be translatable to other transporter systems.

G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) are mediators of and
therapeutic targets for diverse disorders, including chronic pain. This proposal challenges the
dogmas that these receptors signal primarily from the plasma membrane and that cell surface
receptors are the optimal therapeutic targets. Completed studies revealed that GPCR endosomal
signaling controls pain and that endosomally-targeted antagonists provide more effective
analgesia than conventional drugs. The renewal application extends these concepts to
tropomyosin receptor kinase A (TrkA), a RTK for nerve growth factor (NGF). Although successful
for the treatment of pain, NGF monoclonal antibodies have not been approved due to adverse
outcomes of systemic antagonism. A deeper understanding of how NGF and TrkA signal pain is
required. Anatomical and electrophysiological studies with mouse and human nociceptors,
behavioral studies in mice, biophysical assays using recombinant proteins, model cells and
nociceptors, and nanoparticle-encapsulated antagonists will be used to study NGF pain. Aim 1
hypothesizes that neuropilin 1 (NRP1) is required for NGF-induced sensitization of nociceptors
and NGF-evoked nociception. Preliminary studies suggest that NRP1 and the scaffolding protein
GAIP/RGS19-interacting protein (GIPC1) are necessary for NGF-induced nociception. Co-
expression of TrkA, NRP1 and GIPC1 protein and mRNA in mouse and human nociceptors will
be studied. Inhibitors of NRP1 and GIPC1 will be used to ascertain their contributions to NGF-
induced sensitization of nociceptors and nociception. Aim 2 hypothesizes that NRP1 acts as an
NGF coreceptor and TrkA chaperone to enhance NGF signaling of pain in nociceptors.
Biophysical approaches will be used to study NGF association with NRP1, assembly of
TrkA/NRP1 heteromers, TrkA surface expression, and NGF signaling in subcellular
compartments of nociceptors. The role of GIPC1 as a scaffold for TrkA and NRP1 association will
be studied. Aim 3 hypothesizes that endocytosis and endosomal NGF/TrkA/NRP1 signaling in
nociceptors mediates sustained sensitization and nociception. The contribution of endocytosis to
NGF-induced nociception will be studied using inhibitors of endocytosis and NGF/TrkA/NRP1
antagonists encapsulated into nanoparticles designed to deliver cargo to endosomes of
nociceptors. NGF-induced endocytosis of TrkA/NRP1, compartmentalized signaling, nociceptor
sensitization and nociception will be studied. A deep understanding of TrkA trafficking-dependent
signaling will provide insights into the mechanisms and treatment of chronic pain, with implications
for other RTK-mediated pathologies (e.g., cancer).

Children with speech sound disorder show diminished intelligibility in spoken communication, with negative con-
sequences for both social-emotional and academic-occupational outcomes [1–4]. While most speech deviations
resolve by the late school-age years, between 2-5% of speakers exhibit residual speech sound disorder (RSSD)
that persists through adolescence or even adulthood [5–7]. Both affected children/families and speech-language
pathologists (SLPs) have highlighted the critical need for research to identify more effective forms of treatment for
children with RSSD. Our work in the previous funding cycle showed that individuals with RSSD benefit from treat-
ment incorporating technologically enhanced sensory feedback (visual-acoustic biofeedback, ultrasound biofeed-
back). However, real-world adoption of biofeedback treatment remains limited by equipment costs and lack of
access to providers with specialized training.
 For our next phase of research, we focus on developing methods to support wider implementation of
technology-enhanced treatment for RSSD. Specifically, we investigate the possibility that access to biofeedback
can be expanded through telepractice service delivery and the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-powered technol-
ogy to extend the services provided by SLPs. At the same time, we evaluate whether the efficacy of biofeedback
can be further enhanced by adopting a precision medicine approach in which a treatment method is selected
based on a learner’s individual profile of sensory strengths and weaknesses.
 In this proposal, we will conduct the first controlled comparison of biofeedback treatment delivered in person
versus via telepractice (Aim 1), testing our hypothesis that biofeedback intervention can be delivered remotely
without any unacceptable loss of efficacy. If successful, this study will greatly expand the reach of biofeedback by
making it easier for children with RSSD to connect with trained clinicians. In Aim 2, we will utilize technology de-
veloped in the previous funding cycle to assess whether the maintenance of gains achieved through biofeedback
treatment can be enhanced through AI-mediated home practice. Finally, Aim 3 will lay groundwork for a precision
medicine approach by testing whether relative response to ultrasound and visual-acoustic biofeedback can be
predicted from a learner’s profile of sensory response across auditory and somatosensory domains.
 While new technologies have the potential to revolutionize the development and delivery of interventions for
speech disorders, there is an ongoing need for well-designed research studies to bring these advances into
evidence-based clinical practice. This research will address the needs of children with RSSD and the clinicians
who treat them by providing a robust evidence base to guide clinical decision-making and user-friendly tools that
support implementation.

Social vocalizations and movement-generated sounds often provide pivotal knowledge about an animal’s
identity, location, or state, yet most studies of natural behavior fail to integrate acoustic information with
simultaneous recordings of high-dimensional neural activity and behavioral dynamics. This proposal will develop
novel experimental and computational methods to attribute vocal and non-vocal sounds to individuals in a
naturalistic, acoustically complex, multi-animal environment. By integrating this rich acoustic information with
simultaneous video and wireless neural recordings, we seek to predict auditory cortical responses to auditory
cues, as a function of social context and individual identity within the family. Aim 1 will develop new tools with
which to attribute vocal and non-vocal sounds to individual animals in a multi-animal setting (i.e., the “who said
what” problem). In Aim 1A, we will collect, curate, and publicly release a range of benchmark datasets containing
simultaneous camera and microphone array recordings of multi-animal interactions with ground truth labels of
sound sources. We will use these benchmarks to validate new models for sound localization. In Aim 1B, we will
develop and release deep learning models that localize sounds with calibrated confidence intervals, using
synchronized video measurements to enhance predictions. Aim 2 will use these tools to identify archetypal,
acoustically-driven social behaviors. We will establish a new experimental paradigm that permits months-long
monitoring of rodent social behavior in a large, naturalistic environment with simultaneous camera and
microphone array recordings. Using this data, we will develop novel data analytic approaches that leverage
synchronized audio and video data streams to identify social interaction sequences. A key goal is to assess
individual differences in social behavior across families. Aim 3 is a proof-of-concept experiment in which we
determine how acoustically-driven social behaviors (established in Aim 2) predict auditory cortex responses to
both vocal or movement-generated sounds. To accomplish this, we will make continuous wireless
electrophysiological recordings from the auditory cortex of adolescent and adult gerbils within their naturalistic
family environment. We will build regression models to infer our ability to predict neural responses from
auditory/behavioral covariates (encoding models).

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is the most common inflammatory joint disease caused by a chronic inflammation in
joints, where no effective treatment is currently available. Currently there is no effective model can accurately
dissect RA pathogenesis and consistently predict the effect of a therapeutic agent in patients. Better model
systems that can accurately recapitulate the immune responses and pathological processes of RA in the
human synovial microenvironment with immunomodulatory treatments are critically required. In this work we
aim to develop a fully patient-derived in vitro RA disease model termed “Synovium-on-a-Chip” by including full
spectrum of synovial cell types, which can serve as a precision medicine platform to (1) interrogate human RA
pathobiology and to (2) achieve "clinical trial on chips" for stratifying patients and pre-screening of novel
immunotherapy. Simulating the structure and inflammatory microenvironment of the synovium with such a
biomimetic vascularized immunocompetent microphysiological system will represent a major advance over
existing models, providing much greater biomimicry and enabling next-step studies to allow rational selection
of immunomodulatory drugs to personalize treatment of RA patients.

Allostatic load, which is characterized by the dysregulation of physiological activity across multiple systems in
the body, has been linked to an increased risk of chronic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, and stroke.
However, the prevalence of allostatic load is not equally distributed among US subgroups, with Black adults
having higher allostatic load than White adults, particularly during middle and older age. The reasons for these
disparities are not fully understood, despite research into factors such as stressors, diet, and socioeconomic
position. Discrimination has been identified as a risk factor for allostatic load. While discrimination is
understood as a multidimensional construct that operates at multiple levels and in different social contexts, the
association between multiple forms of discrimination and allostatic load remains understudied, as well as the
underlying mechanisms by which discrimination may affect physiological function. The cellular-level processes
through which discrimination "gets under the skin" and leads to physiological dysregulation remain unclear.
This study aims to define the relationship between multiple forms of discrimination and allostatic load using
data from three large, population-based cohort studies, in order to increase the efficacy of prevention efforts
and treatment to reduce allostatic load and Black-White disparities in allostatic load. By assessing the
associations between multiple forms of discrimination (neighborhood and interpersonal) with allostatic load, the
study will quantify the extent to which discrimination explains racial disparities in allostatic load. The study will
also investigate the extent to which "Conserved Transcriptional Response to Adversity" (CTRA) gene
expression mediates the relationship between discrimination and allostatic load, as well as evaluate the
moderating effect of social integration on these associations. Overall, this study has the potential to inform the
optimization of existing clinical and place-based interventions aimed at reducing allostatic load by highlighting
the importance of addressing discrimination and identifying the timing, context, and most at-risk groups that
can benefit from these interventions to reduce health disparities.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Disorders of gut-brain interactions (DGBIs), the most common GI problems world-wide, are characterized by
recurring, chronic gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms including dysmotility (constipation/diarrhea), GI pain and
abnormal gut-brain communication. Treatment options for DGBIs are extremely limited due to a poor
understanding of their pathophysiology. What is known about DGBIs is that the majority of affected patients
have a co-morbid mood disorder, mainly anxiety (AD) but also depression (DD). Like DGBIs, AD and DD are
common and with limited treatment options. Further, studies show an increased risk of DGBI development
with a pre-existent mood disorder and vice versa. Identifying links between DBGIs and mood disorders is
thus highly likely to elucidate mechanisms that instigate development of novel therapies for both conditions.
The transmitter, serotonin (5-HT) modulates symptoms of DGBIs, AD and DD, leading many treatments to be
targeted towards 5-HT regulation. In particular, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are highly
prescribed. Yet, SSRIs have severe limitations: low remission (<50%) and resolution (<1/3) rates and;
adverse effects (e.g., GI pain, dysmotility, and [paradoxical] anxiety). SSRIs function by inhibiting the
serotonin reuptake transporter (SERT), thus increasing 5-HT transmission. SERT is located in the CNS, ENS
and the GI epithelium and SSRIs are systemically absorbed, leading to SSRI action/SERT antagonism in the
CNS, ENS and GI epithelium. Yet, it is not known where SSRIs precisely act to induce their beneficial versus
adverse effects. Our data show that: (1) beneficial SSRI effects (anxiolytic, anti-depressive, anti-nociceptive)
result from SERT antagonism in the GI epithelium and may involve vagal- and 5-HT3-mediated signaling and;
(2) detrimental SSRI effects result from ENS or CNS SERT antagonism (AD, dysmotility, pain). Thus,
selective pharmacologic blockade of GI epithelial SERT could be beneficial for treating DGBIs, AD and DD
without producing negative effects linked to systemic SSRI exposure. We have created a state-of-the-art
SSRI delivery system that maximally disperses and retains SSRI locally on the intestinal epithelium while
minimizing systemic absorption. We now propose to: (1) elucidate the roles of vagal signaling in linking gut
epithelial 5-HT to beneficial effects on GI pain and mood; (2) examine how ENS SERT ablation affects DGBI
symptoms and mood, to determine if avoidance of ENS SERT antagonism is necessary to prevent negative
and efficacy-reducing effects of systemic SSRIs; (3) determine whether our novel SSRI delivery platform
provides the beneficial mood effects of SSRIs while avoiding deleterious effects on GI pain, GI motility and
mood. If successful, the platform is known to be safe so can be efficiently translated to clinical studies.

Despite therapeutic advances, cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of death worldwide.
There is thus an urgent need for innovation in CVD research and drug development. One class of molecules
thought to hold particular promise is noncoding RNA, the importance of which was largely unrecognized until the
last decade. The human genome is estimated to encode between 30,000 and 60,000 long noncoding RNAs
(lncRNA), far more than the number of protein coding transcripts, and yet the vast majority remain unstudied.
LncRNAs have been shown to play critical roles in genome organization and orchestration of gene expression
in normal cellular function and disease. Discerning lncRNAs with regulatory functions in cardiovascular health
and disease, and dissecting their molecular mechanisms is a paramount priority, and challenge, for the field.
Using a systems biology approach that relies on human tissues and animal models, clinical data, predictive
bioinformatics and deep molecular phenotyping, we have identified a conserved cis-acting lncRNA, which we
have named CASLR, that is highly expressed in human and mouse atherosclerotic plaques. In this proposal, we
aim to decipher the molecular mechanisms by which this novel lncRNA regulates inflammatory gene expression,
and innate immune responses that drive atherosclerosis progression and ultimately plaque rupture, which can
lead to myocardial infarction or stroke. Our studies will use novel mouse models and innovative 3-dimensional
human vascular explants to test the impact of CASLR inhibition on atherosclerotic inflammation and plaque
burden. Collectively, the proposed investigation into lncRNA CASLR will advance our knowledge of inflammatory
mechanisms of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and its complications, and provide foundational studies
for the design of new therapeutic strategies.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT ABSTRACT
Statins reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events and mortality. However, providers fail to
prescribe statin therapy for about half of patients meeting guideline criteria for initiation. The electronic health
record (EHR) creates opportunities to develop clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) to support
cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk recognition, assessment, and management. However, low provider adoption
has limited the clinical impact of CDSSs designed to improve guideline-concordant statin prescribing.
Integrating insights from behavioral economics into CDSS design represents a novel approach to improving
adoption by minimizing key barriers - provider time and cognitive load burden. Behavioral economics studies
the effects of psychological, social, cognitive, and emotional factors on the decisions of individuals and uses
nudges to influence behavior at a largely unconscious level. Nudges are defined as positive reinforcement and
indirect suggestions which have a non-forced effect on decision-making. For example, “opt-out” options for
organ donation consent lead to striking differences in enrollment. Nudges represent an exciting and novel
approach to developing CDSSs that minimize provider burden and are, therefore, more efficient, scalable, and
impactful (i.e., optimized). The overall objective of this proposal is to develop and optimize a CDSS, including
several nudges, to increase guideline-concordant statin prescribing for CVD risk (Nudge-CVD-CDSS). We use
an innovative, engineering-inspired multiphase optimization strategy (MOST) framework to arrive at an
intervention that is not just efficacious or effective but efficient and scalable. Several potential intervention
components (EHR-nudges) will be developed, usability tested, revised, and evaluated. A randomized trial
using a specialized design will evaluate the individual and combined effects of nudges. We will seek the
combination of nudges that maximizes impact on guideline-concordant statin prescribing while minimizing
provider time and cognitive load burden. Specific Aims: 1) To develop, based on a conceptual model of the
prescribing process, a set of potential intervention components (EHR-nudges) to promote and support
AHA/ACC guideline-concordant statin prescribing, 2) To revise potential intervention components through
iterative usability testing, including real-time measures of provider time and cognitive load burden and 3) To
use a randomized trial with a specialized design to identify which EHR-nudges, or combinations of nudges,
contribute most efficiently to AHA/ACC guideline-concordant statin prescribing. The proposed work is
significant in its efforts to develop an effective, efficient, and scalable intervention to improve guideline-
concordant care for CVD risk management. It is innovative in its use of insights from behavioral economics and
the MOST framework to optimize a CDSS by balancing clinical impact with provider time and cognitive load
burden. Achieving the project’s objectives will advance the science of CDSS design and development.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Visual sensory substitution devices, in which images from a video camera are converted to a cross-modal signal
that is then presented to the subjects in place of direct visual information, offer an alternative, non-surgical
approach for the blind to appreciate aspects of their immediate environment. These non-invasive, low-cost
technologies can also offer higher visual acuity and wider fields of view than currently available retinal and
cortical implants. However, sensory substitution devices are rarely adopted to interpret and translate complex,
natural environments for daily use by blind individuals partly because of their impracticality. In addition, little is
known about the perceptual and behavioral consequences of delivering new patterns of information as an
alternative sense when the visual system is damaged at different ages. The metabolic and functional processes
that allow the deprived human visual cortex for enhancing cross-modal plasticity have not been clearly defined
either. These research gaps must be filled before sensory substitution can be exploited as a method of vision
rehabilitation for improving function and independence while reducing the associated costs of blindness. The
goal of this project is to develop and refine sensory substitution technologies and to identify the determinants of
cross-modal plasticity in brains deprived of visual input in order to facilitate sensory substitution. To achieve this
goal, we will incorporate artificial intelligence (AI) to simplify images of complex, natural environments into
isolated objects for sensory substitution. We will then use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and spectroscopy
(MRS), combined with behavioral assessments to examine the neural substrates of sensory substitution in early
and late blind subjects. We will leverage tactile and auditory substitution stimuli to determine how changes in
neurochemicals reflect the cross-modal activity of visually deprived brains. We will also test how training with AI
can help blind individuals interpret visual environmental cues in a more meaningful way. Feedback from the
behavioral and neurobiological results will help refine our sensory substitution devices. Aim 1: To improve
sensory substitution toward practical use, we will use AI and 3D coding to convert complex everyday scenarios
into simplified and aesthetically engaging versions that aid both immediate task performance and sensory
substitution training. Aim 2: To determine how visual processing pathways in the brain adapt to vision loss, we
will employ advanced MRI and MRS to unveil the structural, metabolic, and functional brain properties in
participants with different onset ages and durations of blindness before training. Aim 3: To determine the effects
of sensory substitution training on visual processing pathways and performance of the blind, we will use
advanced MRI and MRS to determine if cross-modal perceptual learning alters the deprived visual cortex toward
a more plastic state via modulating its excitatory-inhibitory balance and choline levels. We will also examine the
neurobehavioral changes that occur when identifying and locating the objects of interest using auditory or tactile
stimuli with and without AI-assisted image deconstruction.

Close HLA matching of kidney donors to their recipients plays a vital role in graft survival. However,
prioritizing antigen-level HLA matching in US deceased donor allocation leads to racial disparities in access to
well-matched donors. Only 3.04% of transplants to Black recipients between 2000 and 2017 were the lowest-
risk 0-ABDR antigen mismatch, compared to 13.95% for Whites. Recent advances in precision
histocompatibility testing have improved alloimmune risk stratification for kidney transplants, and prioritizing
low molecular mismatch instead of low antigen mismatch could significantly increase graft survival. Molecular
mismatch better identifies high-risk recipients who have much greater odds of developing new dnDSA (HR:
23) and antibody-mediated rejection (HR: 5) compared to low-risk recipients. While molecular HLA matching
increases graft survival, the impact of prioritizing molecular mismatch in US deceased donor kidney allocation,
including the number of years of additional graft life and whether such matching might have disparate impacts
by race, ethnicity, or gender is unknown. The preferred molecular matching paradigm, and whether to
prioritize more moderate or fewer exceptional donor/recipient matches remain uncertain.
We will use a detailed simulation to project impacts of prioritizing molecular-level rather than antigen-level
matching, while adjusting candidates’ allocation score by our novel metric, personalized immunologic
compatibility likelihood (PICL). The PICL adjustment aims to balance the biological difficulty in finding well-
matched donors, similar to the current adjustment performed to account for the candidates’ sensitization level
(CPRA). While HLA genotyping to measure molecular mismatch isn't standard practice for donors and
recipients currently, the technology is expected to be available within the next 2-3 years. Using our high-
resolution HLA genotyping dataset, derived from a pool of over 2.77 million stem cell donors across seven US
racial/ethnic groups, we will create simulated pools of waitlist candidates and donors and compute each
candidate's PICL. We have the following aims:
(1) Estimate graft survival benefits of prioritizing molecular HLA matching prioritization in the US deceased
donor kidney allocation, augmenting existing simulation tools to model molecular matching. (2) Develop a
personalized immunologic compatibility likelihood (PICL) metric, and measure antigen/molecular match
likelihood distributions across candidate racial groups, to characterize inequities in the probability of finding a
well-matched donor in the US deceased donor pool. (3) Incorporate PICL into deceased donor allocation to
promote equity, using simulation optimization algorithms to design a points system that increases graft
survival and mitigates disparities in the transplant rate and the rate of well-matched transplants.

Clinically, atrophy of the intrinsic laryngeal musculature is poorly defined likely related to limited understanding
of fundamental biological processes underlying this complex, aberrant tissue phenotype. This lack of insight
underlies suboptimal therapeutic strategies for these challenging patients. In addition to fundamental
investigation regarding this phenotype, we hypothesize that initiation and maintenance of atrophy of the
intrinsic laryngeal musculature is related to signaling events in the mucosa. Specifically, our laboratory
elucidated the role of TGF-β signaling with an emphasis on therapeutic strategies targeting the SMAD family of
signaling proteins in the vocal fold lamina propria. SMADs, however, also mediate muscle atrophy in other
systems, specifically through regulation of atrogenes and myostatin, a member of the TGF-β superfamily. We
hypothesize that the inherent response to injury in the lamina propria elicits and/or enhances an atrophic in the
muscle. This concept is inherently innovative in that it refutes clinical dogma suggesting the vocal fold mucosa
and muscle of the vocal folds operate as wholly separate and distinct entities. In that regard, we propose to
interrogate fundamental and functional laryngeal muscle outcomes of recurrent laryngeal nerve injury-mediated
thyroarytenoid atrophy in the context of both acute and chronic mucosal injury. In addition, we seek to
interrogate key biochemical relationships and interactions between multiple cell types from the vocal folds to
provide foundational insight into processes underling atrophy. And finally, we seek to provide preliminary data
related to therapeutic strategies to prevent/treat laryngeal muscle atrophy targeting SMAD signaling.
Ultimately, these data represent substantive contributions to the literature and are foundational for the
development of novel treatment strategies for millions of patients with disability related to voice disorders and
laryngeal disease.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Summary
Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a highly aggressive and lethal disease, accounting for about 15% of all lung
cancers. SCLC patients often initially respond to chemotherapy; however, their tumors invariably recur within 6
to 12 months. Treatment regimens for SCLC have remained largely unchanged for the past decades.
Nonetheless, the addition of immunotherapy (such as anti-PD-L1 therapy) to chemotherapy was recently
approved for the first-line treatment of adult patients with extensive-stage SCLC (ES-SCLC). Although the clinical
benefit of adding anti-PD-L1 has been modest with an increase in median overall survival (OS) of approximately
2 months, these results have suggested that anti-tumor immunity can play a role in SCLC treatment. Notably,
there are limited options for treating SCLC with targeted agents, emphasizing the critical need for identifying new
targets and treatment paradigms. Our proposed studies address these unmet needs. SCLC has been
increasingly recognized as a highly heterogeneous disease, which is largely regulated by four transcription
factors (TFs). Neuroendocrine (NE) SCLC subtypes have been characterized by differential expression of the
ASCL1 and NEUROD1 TFs and non-NE SCLCs by POU2F3 and YAP1. A recent study demonstrated an
essential role of master regulator MYC in driving the evolution dynamics of these subtypes of SCLC, postulating
their dependence on mutual transcriptional and epigenetic programs for tumor initiation and survival. We aim to
leverage our recent discoveries for targeted therapy and state-of-the-art preclinical platform to identify novel
strategies that mitigate the common dependencies in heterogenous SCLC. We previously demonstrated that
SCLC cells are addicted to a CDK7-regulated gene expression program mediated, in part, by oncogenic
members of the MYC family of TFs and proto-oncogenic NE lineage TFs. Furthermore, our recent data has
uncovered a previously unrecognized role of MUC1-C in regulating common oncogenic transcriptomes in both
NE and non-NE SCLC. In addition, we have successfully established multiple orthotopic murine SCLC models,
which represent the four SCLC subtypes that include SCLC-ASCL1, -NEUROD1, -YAP1 and -POU2F3.
Importantly, these murine models have an intact lung immune system making them a powerful resource for
immune-oncology studies. Utilizing this preclinical platform, we will 1). evaluate the efficacy of MUC1-C inhibitor
alone and in combination with CDK7 inhibitor in NE and non-NE SCLC in vitro and in vivo; 2). define the TME
alterations induced by MUC1-C inhibition alone and in combination with CDK7 inhibition; and 3). define the
cancer intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms by which MUC1-C and CDK7 inhibition alone and in combination
contribute to antitumor immunity. Ultimately, characterizing the underlying mechanisms associated with
responses to our targeted therapies will help develop tailored treatment for SCLC patients.

Oncoproteins drive tumor development and aggressive growth by dysregulating the signaling pathways involved
in cell growth, survival, and proliferation. Targeting oncoproteins directly, or their downstream pathways, has
resulted in novel therapies currently being used for the treatment of different cancer subtypes.
The RAS family of guanosine triphosphatase (GTP) hydrolases (GTPases) are a group of oncoproteins, that
have roles in cancer initiation, progression, and resistance to therapies. Furthermore, mutations in genes
encoding classical RAS proteins are very frequent in cancer. RAS proteins cycle between a guanosine
diphosphate (GDP) inactive form and a GTP active form. In its GTP-bound conformation, RAS proteins promote
activation of downstream signaling pathways that contribute to the growth and proliferation of cells. This
nucleotide cycle is assisted by accessory proteins that catalyze the loading or hydrolysis of GTP and
dysregulation of this mechanism is also frequent in cancer.
Emerging evidence has shown that non-classical RAS proteins also play critical roles in cancer biology; however,
their mechanisms of regulation and tumorigenesis are not well-understood and differ from classical RAS proteins.
We have recently discovered a novel mechanism of regulation of the non-classical RAS proteins RIT1 and MRAS
that is mediated by ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of the inactive GDP-bound form. Our work
identified LZTR1, a novel protein that binds RIT1 and MRAS and forms a complex with the E3 Ubiquitin ligase
Cullin-3 (CRL3LZTR1). Cancer-associated mutations in RIT1 or LZTR1 disrupt their interaction and lead to the
accumulation of non-classical RAS GTPases and activation of downstream signaling.
In this application, we propose to study critical aspects regarding the regulation of this novel complex, its
contribution to tumorigenesis, and potential pharmacological strategies to restore protein degradation.
In Aim 1, we will use biochemical and structural approaches to understand the determinants of LZTR1 selectivity
towards the non-classical RAS GTPases RIT1 and MRAS and the function of its protein domains.
In Aim 2, we plan to elucidate the signaling mechanisms that regulate CRL3LZTR1 activity in cells and how these
pathways can contribute to the resistance to specific targeted therapies.
In Aim 3, we will develop novel mouse models that are driven by an oncogenic RIT1 mutation that is resistant to
LZTR1-mediated proteasomal degradation and analyze the molecular signatures of these tumors. In addition,
we will develop proof-of-concept pharmacological treatments for RIT1-driven cancers.
Overall, our project will address a major knowledge gap in the mechanisms of regulation of non-classical RAS
oncoproteins and will provide novel preclinical models and therapeutic strategies for these cancers. The work
described in this application is the first step to develop mechanism-based and precise medicines for targeting
these oncogenic pathways in cancer.

Treating KRAS mutant lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) remains a major challenge for clinical oncology.
Approximately 20% of KRAS mutant LUAD tumors carry loss-of-function mutations in KEAP1, a negative
regulator of NRF2, which is the master transcriptional regulator of the endogenous antioxidant response. Using
CRISPR/Cas9-based somatic editing in a genetically engineered mouse model of KRAS-driven LUAD we
demonstrated that loss of Keap1 hyper-activates Nrf2 and dramatically accelerates KRAS-driven LUAD.
Combining CRISPR/Cas9-based genetic screening and metabolic analyses, we showed that Keap1 mutant cells
are dependent on increased glutamine metabolism, and this property can be therapeutically exploited through
the pharmacological inhibition. In this application we focus on characterizing the molecular mechanisms and
therapeutic potential of targeting glutamine metabolism in KRAS-driven KEAP1 mutant LUAD This application
aims to: 1) Assess the therapeutic potential of novel glutamine antagonist in both human and murine KRASG12D-
and KRASG12C-driven KEAP1 mutant LUAD pre-clinical models, 2) Provide a rationale for sub-stratification of
human lung cancer patients with KRAS-KEAP1 or -NRF2 mutant tumors as likely responders to glutamine
antagonists and determine the therapeutic potential of combining with clinically relevant KC-Is with DRP-104. 3)
Characterize the metabolic mechanisms underlying glutamine antagonist sensitivity in KRAS-driven KEAP1
mutant LUAD, and 4) Identify mechanisms of resistance to glutamine dependence. Our studies will provide a
rationale for sub-stratification of patients with hyperactivation of the NRF2 pathway as treatment responders to
DRP-104, a novel glutamine antagonist in clinical trials, which is pertinent to the goals of precision medicine.

VEXAS (Vacuoles, E1 enzyme, X-linked, Autoinflammatory, Somatic) syndrome is a newly identified
inflammatory and hematologic disease caused by somatic mutations in UBA1. Individuals with UBA1 mutations
have clinical manifestations similar to well-established rheumatic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and giant
cell arteritis but have unique manifestations including elevated mortality and treatment-refractory disease.
1/14,000 individuals are affected by VEXAS syndrome, and there are no effective treatments due to a limited
understanding of pathogenesis. We propose to further the mechanistic understanding of the disease as a first
step in developing treatments.
VEXAS syndrome is caused by hypomorphic mutations in UBA1 that lead to a reduction in global ubiquitylation.
UBA1 mutations are acquired and occur in the earliest bone marrow progenitor cells, become lineage restricted,
and accumulate within the myeloid lineage and are absent in lymphocytes. We have extensively studied cellular
models and patient derived cells to better understand the mechanism of disease in VEXAS syndrome. We have
identified multiple activated inflammatory pathways, although given the complexity of treatments and symptoms
in patients, these have not revealed pathogenic processes. Similarly, in UBA1 mutant cells there is activation of
the unfolded protein response likely due to accumulation of proteins intended to be degraded. Given the severity
of the disease, the lack of effective therapies, and the limited utility of cellular models to date, we propose here
to focus our work on our newly established mouse models of VEXAS syndrome to understand the cellular and
molecular mechanisms leading to disease. To this end, we will utilize conditional knockout (cKO) UBA1 and
conditional knock-in (cKI) UBA1 VEXAS mutations transgenic mouse lines to determine the contribution of
specific lineages to inflammation, the types of inflammation, downstream pathways mediating inflammation and
finally potential ways to reverse disease. We will study our Uba1 cKO, and cKI lines in bone marrow progenitor,
myeloid, B- and T-cells and determine the role of each cell type in driving organismal inflammation (Aim 1). We
will also look at these cell specific models to identify the molecular signaling pathways altered in cells mediating
inflammation (Aim 2). Finally, we will utilize small molecule activators and inhibitors in candidate pathways such
as ubiquitylation and the unfolded protein response to try to reverse inflammation in mouse and cellular models.
Our overall goal is to better define VEXAS syndrome inflammation and molecular signing to enable improved
therapies.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：The inability to slow or revert progression to posttraumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA) after injury has devastating
consequences for a young population, whose only therapeutic option remains knee replacement at a young age.
Despite extensive research, PTOA pathophysiology continues to be poorly understood which translates in
suboptimal diagnosis tools and limited treatment options. Although there is consensus that cell death (apoptosis)
and low-grade inflammation play a major role in PTOA onset, we lack understanding on how these factors tip
the healing response to injury into a vicious cycle of perpetuating joint damage. Unfortunately, blocking
inflammation or apoptosis alone has proven to be insufficient to prevent progression to PTOA. In our preliminary
studies we found a synergistic interaction between apoptotic articular chondrocytes and the inflammatory
response of synovial cells that exacerbates apoptosis and inflammation creating a devastating production of pro-
inflammatory and catabolic signaling. Thus, we hypothesize that a combinatorial treatment targeting apoptosis
and inflammation is needed to reinstate joint homeostasis after injury. Here we propose a comprehensive
approach to characterize the crosstalk between inflammation and apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. We will identify
in vitro the crosstalk mechanisms and the molecular interplay between apoptosis and inflammation by analyzing
the transcriptome of articular chondrocytes and synovial cells exposed to one or both stimuli and by
characterizing the paracrine signaling. In vitro studies will allow us to study single interactions between cells and
stimuli. We will then assess inflammation and apoptosis in vivo. Studying the dynamic crosstalk between events
in knee joints represents a major challenge since we need to capture two processes in the same animal in vivo
overtime. Molecular imaging represents a natural approach that can capture both inflammation and apoptosis in
the same animal overtime and make possible the study of the dynamic synergistic interaction between these two
processes. We will combine our novel MRI contrast agent that detects pro-inflammatory signaling in articular
cartilage, with optical imaging agents targeting apoptosis and a positron emission tomography (PET) tracer
targeting the folate receptor expressed in activated macrophages. This multimodal imaging approach will allow
longitudinal assessment of the activity and timing of inflammation and apoptosis during the progression to PTOA.
We will investigate in vivo the effect of blocking apoptosis has in inflammation and vice versa. Finally, a
combinatorial treatment targeting apoptosis and inflammation will be explored to reinstate joint homeostasis after
injury. These studies will lay the groundwork for the development of therapeutic strategies targeting the crosstalk
between apoptosis and inflammation but also contribute to a fundamental understanding of how the interplay of
crucial pathological mechanism can contribute to PTOA onset.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is home to two-thirds of all people living with HIV (PLHIV). Widely-adopted targets
such as “95-95-95” (diagnosing ≥95% of PLHIV, treating ≥95% of those diagnosed, and achieving viral load
suppression in ≥95% of those on treatment) have fueled tremendous progress in access and effective use of
HIV treatment, with surveillance from Population HIV Impact Assessments (PHIAs) used to monitor progress.
Although these efforts have reduced HIV incidence and mortality, HIV/AIDS remains the leading cause of
death among SSA adults, and HIV incidence remains high, with many regions not on track to achieve the
Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) of HIV incidence <0.1% per person-year by 2030. Pre-exposure
prophylaxis (PrEP) has been shown to dramatically reduce HIV acquisition risk when taken as directed.
However, at a population level, PrEP use in SSA is still limited. Several modeling studies, including our own,
suggest the SDG could be achieved in much of SSA with sufficient expansions in PrEP access and use.
A challenge for PrEP expansion in SSA is the lack of established targets, and lack of surveillance to monitor
progress toward targets. Such target-setting-and-tracking approaches have been remarkably successful in
driving scale-up of HIV treatment and monitoring progress through PHIAs. Our central hypothesis is that PrEP
research data can be used to derive setting-specific PrEP coverage targets corresponding to incidence
reduction goals, which can be monitored using population-based drug measurements as a “PHIA for PrEP.”
Several innovations are needed to enable a “PHIA for PrEP.” First (Aim 1), the relationship between drug
concentrations measured and reduction in HIV incidence needs to be established. This was previously
accomplished for men who have sex with men (MSM) in the Global North. We will determine this relationship
using pooled PrEP study data from SSA, where transmission is predominantly heterosexual. Second (Aim 2),
the totality of the effects of PrEP program participation need to be understood, which may extend beyond the
pharmacological effects of PrEP drugs. Several studies have measured HIV incidence reductions among non-
adherent participants and those taking placebos, suggesting PrEP program participation may serve as a
“gateway” to behavioral risk reduction. We will estimate these effects using pooled study results from post-
licensure SSA PrEP pilots and demonstration projects. Third (Aim 3), PrEP target-setting needs to account for
differential HIV risk across population groups and settings. We will use agent-based HIV transmission
modeling to estimate a range of PrEP coverage configurations that achieve epidemic targets, with trade-offs
between coverage vs. adherence and between overall coverage vs. targeting those most-at-risk. Cognizant of
stigma, accessibility, and other challenges, we will engage policy-makers, advocates, community advisory
boards, as well as experts in HIV trials, surveys, and bioethics, to weigh PrEP target options and design
monitoring strategies using a “PHIA for PrEP.”

Neurotrophic a-herpesvirus including herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV1) establish lifelong, latent (non-replicating)
infections in sensory and sympathetic neurons. Recurring reactivation episodes triggered in response to
physiological stress interrupt latency and allow virus reproduction, shedding and spread to new hosts. While it
has long been known that HSV1 reactivation can be triggered by a perplexing variety of physiological and
neurological stresses, the underlying molecular mechanisms have remained obscure. Recent studies using
cultured primary neurons to model HSV1 latency and reactivation, allows us to build a detailed but still incomplete
picture of how the virus is maintained in a dormant state and how stress response pathways converge to disrupt
this control leading to reactivation. By applying cutting-edge single cell technologies to a well-defined primary
neuron infection model, we have now identified neuronal factors that are rapidly mobilized in response to HSV1
reactivation and have the potential to block the virus replication program at a defined stage. The long-reaching
goal of this project is to elucidate the molecular mechanisms responsible for this cell-intrinsic host response. We
propose studies to identify the viral reactivation signature recognized by the host neuron and will determine why
virus gene expression is selectively inhibited. Furthermore, our multifaceted approach will allow us to decipher
the complex relationship between a viral parasite and its human host. By defining the molecular processes
involved in regulating the behavior of latent virus we hope to gain a better understanding how neurons can be
protected from a wide range of intrinsic and extrinsic insults.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
B cells are critical for immune responses to infection and in many forms of autoimmune disease. They develop
in the bone marrow and migrate to lymph nodes and spleen, where they further mature. At the end of this process,
B cells express a high affinity B cell receptor with which they recognize antigen and which allows them to develop
further into either memory B cells or long-lived plasma cells. Both types of cells migrate to the bone marrow and
provide long-term protection from reinfection with the same pathogen. Plasma cells are a B cell type that
produces large quantities of antibodies that are critical for neutralizing pathogens such as influenza virus, or
more recently, SARS-CoV2. Several forms of primary immunodeficiency are caused by defects in B cell
development or maturation including agammaglobulinemia and common variable immunodeficiency (CVID),
which are characterized by a complete or partial lack of antibody production. Underlying these forms of
immunodeficiency are mutations in a plethora of genes that encode transcription factors, cell surface receptors
and signal transduction molecules. Some of these mutations occur in genes encoding ion channels. Ion channels
are located in the cell membrane or membranes of intracellular organelles. They function as gateways to mediate
the transport of charged ions such as calcium, zinc or chloride. Inherited mutations in two ion channels were
shown to prevent the development of B cells resulting in agammaglobulinemia. Studies in mice have identified
additional ion channels that are required for B cell function. Overall however, the role of ion channels in B cells
is poorly understood with only a handful of the more than 600 known ion channel genes implicated in B cell
function to date. This is even more extreme for plasma cells because no ion channel has yet been reported that
specifically regulates plasma cell development or function. This lack of information is in strong contrast to the
well established role of ion channels in cells of the brain, nerves, heart, muscle or kidney. It also represents a
missed opportunity from a basic science perspective and our ability to understand how immune responses to
infection are regulated, and from a therapeutic perspective because ion channels are excellent drug targets.
Drugs modulating ion channel function are a mainstay in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases, neurological
and psychiatric disorders and type 2 diabetes. We have therefore conducted genetic screens to identify novel
ion channels that regulate the development of B cells into plasma cells and identified around 10 such channels.
We investigated several of these further and confirmed that inhibiting their expression in B cells interferes with
plasma cell development. In this proposal, we will focus on two of these channels and determine the molecular
and cellular mechanisms by which they control the development of B cells into plasma cells and their ability to
mount an antibody response to infection with viral pathogens such as influenza.

Loss of myelin, as seen in conditions like multiple sclerosis, frequently leads to balance issues. These dis-
ruptions in balance are attributed to the compromised function of neural circuits associated with the vestibu-
lar system. Despite the clinical significance of this problem, our understanding of how myelin loss affects the
functioning of these circuits remains limited. Consequently, there is a pressing need to elucidate the mecha-
nisms underlying the impact of myelin, its loss and restoration on circuit function. To address these questions,
I propose using zebrafish larvae as a model. They allow for in vivo observation of myelinated axons and func-
tional/behavioral testing. My preliminary data using a pharmacological hypomyelination model showed specific
changes in pitch sensitivity linked to a particular circuit, the vestibulospinal circuit. My aim is to understand the
role of myelin in behavior and circuit function, as well as the deficits caused by myelin loss and potential rescue
through remyelination.
In the K99 phase, I will (1) investigate changes in vestibulospinal circuit neuron responses to body tilts after
hypomyelination, (2) analyze postural and functional deficits after targeted demyelination, and (3) develop a
novel tool for circuit-specific myelin manipulations. These experiments will define the impact of demyelination
on vestibular processing and postural instability. Successful completion will provide functional characterization
of vestibular circuits and validate a selective myelin disruption tool. In the R00 phase, I will (1) explore mech-
anisms of neuronal and behavioral recovery after remyelination and (2) create conditional myelin inhibitors to
model circuit-specific incomplete remyelination. Achieving these goals will shed light on circuit-specific effects
of remyelination after loss.
My long-term goal is to run an independent laboratory using larval zebrafish to (1) understand the mechanisms
by which loss of myelin disrupts neural circuit function and behavior and (2) understand how remyelination
rescues behavioral and functional deficits. To achieve this, my lab will leverage the behavioral technologies I
have used in the first stage of my post-doctoral training, the functional imaging I will master in the K99 training
phase, and my previous training as a molecular and cellular glia -biologist. The proposed studies target an un-
met need: understanding the role of myelin in a circuit specific manner. This work is broadly significant as it ad-
vances our understanding of the relationship of myelin, circuit function and behavior with implications for novel
treatment approaches for demyelinating diseases.

The ability to perceive and respond to vocalizations across behavioral contexts is key for survival, but the
mechanisms for how the brain derives meaning from acoustic features to drive appropriate behavioral responses
remain unknown. I will test the overall hypothesis that top-down control of feed-forward auditory circuits via
cortical projection neurons is critical for recognition of social calls and routing of sensory information to circuits
driving behavior. In the mentored (K99) phase, I will take advantage of an ethological mouse behavior studied
extensively in my postdoctoral lab, in which parentally-experienced mice search for lost pups in response to a
specific type of vocalization. Experienced moms are experts at this behavior, but it can also be learned by virgins,
and learning is correlated with plasticity in the left auditory cortex in females. Pup retrieval involves a complex
sequence of actions, and auditory cues may be required during specific epochs. I will build upon my pilot data
finding that cortical projection neurons are necessary for retrieval, and that exposure to pup calls drives sustained
activity in a distinct projection in experienced females. Aim 1 (K99) uses imaging and multi-area ensemble
recordings to ask how inter-area dynamics in recurrent auditory circuits change during pup calls compared to
non-vocal sounds with similar temporal structures, with the hypothesis that network activity is elevated
specifically during vocalizations to facilitate brain state modulation or communication with sensorimotor circuits
over time scales relevant for behavior. Synaptic mechanisms driving this persistent activity will be examined with
in vivo whole-cell recordings. Aim 2 (K99) will test which projection neurons are required for retrieval and over
what behavioral time scales. Animals vocalize in multiple situations to communicate distinct meanings – for
example, male calls to communicate aggression or courtship – and the brain must make sense of these calls,
using acoustic features as well as non-auditory context cues to distinguish between meanings. In the
independent phase (R00), Aim 3 asks whether calls are processed with neural ensembles and inter-area
dynamics that are generalized across categories or distinct for specific behavioral outcomes. Additionally, the
relevance of different social calls can change depending on an animal’s internal state. Aim 4 (R00) investigates
whether neural ensemble representations of male calls change in female mice as sexual receptivity varies,
measuring activity in cortical ensembles tracked over weeks of experience. In the mentored phase I will complete
a training plan designed to strengthen the experimental and computational skills needed for my research
program as an independent investigator, and to build the professional skills needed for success as a faculty
member, taking advantage of resources and expertise available from the mentor, advisory committee and
broader environment at NYU.

Proper skin restoration after the damage is vital for organismal survival. The lymphatic vascular system is spread
throughout the human body and has a critical function in mammalian physiology. In physiological conditions, its
main function is the regulation of tissue drainage, immunosurveillance, and regeneration. Lymphatic dysfunction
causes lymphedema a medical condition that manifests as tissue swelling and fibrosis. This serious condition
results in profound severe delays in wound repair and the formation of chronic non-healing wounds. The
mechanism by which lymphatic vessels regulate skin repair is unexplored. Additionally, while the role of
lymphatic vessels in immune cell egress from tissues is well-established, how lymphatic vessels may directly
modulate immune function in damaged tissues is poorly-defined. Recently, I discovered that lymphatic vessels
are actively remodeled during wound healing to form small capillaries which are present in close localization to
the wound front and hair follicles. This remodeling is critical for optimal repair as skin-specific loss of lymphatic
vessels results in a significant delay in wound closure accompanied by a massive infiltration of immune cells.
This proposal aims to leverage these observations by 1) delineating the mechanisms and consequences of
lymphatic vessel remodeling during skin repair, and 2) determining the role of lymphatic vessels and fluid
pressure in macrophage behavior during skin repair. This research stands to have a significant clinical impact
because it can serve as a basis for developing new therapeutic avenues for lymphedema ulcers and chronic
wound management. In addition, career-oriented guidance from my mentor and advisors, along with career
development activated during the K99 phase that includes formal coursework on grant writing and project
management, will further facilitate my transition to the R00 phase and my long-term productivity as an
independent academic investigator. Collectively, the proposed research and career development plans are
expected to generate data with a significant impact on understanding the repair and immunomodulatory functions
of lymphatic vessels in skin repair and setting the basis of my future research as an independent researcher.

Cell identity is acquired by integrating multiple signaling inputs that establish complex gene regulatory
networks over time. These signals are converted into expression profiles by the binding of transcription factors
to non-coding regions of DNA known as enhancers. In human adipogenesis, multiple inputs converge onto a
single gene, PPARG. PPARG responds to these inputs through two "super-enhancers", which are dense
collections of individual enhancers. The myriad of input signals that feed into adipogenesis and drive PPARG
activation suggests the presence of complex regulatory logic within the two super-enhancers located up- and
downstream of the PPARG coding region. For instance, Creb1 is an early input in adipogenesis that appears
dispensable later, C/EBPb is required later and subsequently activates C/EBPa to maintain PPARG
transcription, and finally PPARG itself autoregulates to drive PPARG output even further, as adipocytes adopt
their terminal fate. The large genomic distances between enhancers and promoter, and the observation that
chromatin remodeling is a key bottleneck in adipogenesis suggesta hierarchical model of PPARγ activation.
We will systematically determine which functional units of the PPARG super-enhancers respond to diverse
inputs by silencing individual super-enhancer modules in a temporally resolved manner during adipogenesis.
We will combine these findings with direct observation and manipulation of chromatin contacts in single cells, in
order to test whether efficient signal transduction from super-enhancers to promoter requires 2-way
enhancer-promoter chromatin loops or complex multi-way contacts between super-enhancer modules and the
promoter.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：COVID-19 has resulted in a significant burden on the human population following the emergence of SARS-
CoV-2. Since the discovery of SARS-CoV-2 in 2019, millions have succumbed to infection due to an imbalanced
host response orchestrated by the biology of the virus. Characterization of the interactions between SARS-CoV-
2 and the infected host have revealed that the virus manipulates a small subset of signaling pathways culminating
in an overproduction of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines juxtaposed to an underproduction of type I
interferons, the central antiviral defense of vertebrates. An effort to identify kinase drug targets for the treatment
of COVID-19, as kinases represent ideal druggable targets, found that the p38 family of mitogen-activated protein
kinases (MAPKs) are among the most highly active kinases during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover,
perturbation of p38 kinases inhibited both virus replication and cytokine production. Thus, p38 kinases are
promising drug targets to block both virus replication and the excessive inflammation that is a hallmark of severe
COVID-19.
 In a subsequent study, a genetic perturbation approach was used to explore the p38/MAPK-SARS-CoV-2
interface and it was determined that the β isoform of the p38 kinase is an essential host factor for virus replication.
Additionally, inhibition of p38β reduces the abundance of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (N), but not viral
mRNA during infection. Contrary to the assumed pro-inflammatory activity of p38 kinases, findings suggested
p38β negatively regulates the expression of inflammatory cytokines. Lastly, p38-dependent phosphosites on
SARS-CoV-2 N were identified and mutation of these sites resulted in attenuated virus replication. Based on
these data, the overarching goal of the research proposed here is to test the hypothesize that p38β
phosphorylates both viral and host proteins to cumulatively promote SARS-CoV-2 replication and
modulate the host response.
 To further characterize the SARS-CoV-2-p38β interface, Aim 1 will explore the mechanism(s) responsible
for p38β's proviral activity and ascertain the contribution of this biology to the inflammatory response observed
in the context of COVID-19. To this end, viral protein stability will be assessed with translation inhibitors and
affinity-purification mass spectrometry to establish how p38β promotes the steady-state level of viral protein
during infection. In parallel, different immune agonists and genetic perturbations will be tested in Aim 2 to assess
the specificity of p38β-mediated downregulation of inflammatory cytokines and determine if altered expression
of these cytokines contributes to the proviral activity of p38β.
 By characterizing these p38β-SARS-CoV-2 interactions, the research proposed here will enhance the
understanding of SARS-CoV-2 biology, virus-host interactions, and p38β biology in order to inform the
development of novel drug therapies critically needed for the treatment of COVID-19.

Microbial communities and their hosts play a key role in many applications, including protecting humans or plants
against diseases or developing the next generation of biofuels and biological remediation systems needed for
sustainable growth. Gaining a deep understanding of the fundamental biology of these systems is the key to har-
nessing their potential. Advances in high-throughput multi-omics techniques like metagenomics, metatranscrip-
tomics, exometabolomics, and proteomics, allow us to capture multiple snapshots of these complex biological
processes at once. These snapshots create large-scale high-dimensional datasets of omics features (e.g., mi-
crobial species, microbial genes, proteins, and small molecules). The reduced cost has also allowed researchers
to collect more multi-omics time-series data. These temporally resolved multi-omics features can together provide
a comprehensive picture of biological processes and their underlying activities.
These well-designed multi-omics studies have not been analyzed to their fullest potential yet, primarily due to
the lack of appropriate tools and annotation databases required for such analyses. For example, systematically
investigating the time component of this longitudinal data to investigate the temporal dynamics of omics features
in relationship with disease activities is an unmet need in many studies. Therefore, there is a critical need for
statistical tools to greatly improve research infrastructure by integrating different data types and systematically
investigating the time component of this longitudinal data.
This project's overarching goal is to develop efﬁcient, interpretable, and scalable tools based on our previously
developed signal model, called partially-observed Boolean dynamical systems (POBDS), to characterize the time
component and capture the dynamical behavior of microbial communities through multi-omics data. The original
contributions can be organized across the following research goals:
(i) Developing novel methods in the POBDS context capable of modeling multi-omics data obtained through
 various molecular proﬁling technologies and various diseases/domains.
(ii) Developing Bayesian optimization frameworks for the efﬁcient and scalable reconstruction of the network
 topology of microbial communities (i.e., inferring the type of interactions between a large number of genes,
 bacteria, and microbes) through high dimensional multi-omics data.
(iii) Developing Bayesian reinforcement learning perturbation policies to decrease the number of data required
 for the modeling/learning process (overcoming the non-identiﬁability issue) and acquire the most informative
 data in microbial communities.
All the developed tools in this project will be presented in a user-friendly software/tool freely accessible to other
researchers.

Photodynamic therapy (PDT) offers unique mechanisms of cell death and is used to treat many cancers in the
clinic. The principal of phototherapy is that photoactive chemicals delivered to the disease site convert incident
photonic energy into local chemical toxicity, avoiding a systemic shock. PDT is agnostic to classical drug-
resistance pathways and does not cause critical co-morbidities, making it attractive as a monotherapy or as a
component of multi-modal therapy. However, a major criticism of PDT is the need for an external light source,
which limits the application of PDT to superficial lesions or those accessible by fiber optics. To overcome this,
a paradigm shift in the mechanism of light delivery for PDT has recently emerged: bioluminescence (BL)
mediated PDT (BL-PDT), wherein BL enzymes activate spectrally matched, co-localized photosensitizers (PS)
within the lesion, eliminating the need for an external light source. Although this overcomes a major hurdle,
current methods that leverage semiconductor nanoconstructs for BL enzyme delivery are limited in their ability
to localize to the disease. Here, we propose a novel method for BL enzyme delivery and BL-PDT: to
genetically engineer ultra-bright bioluminescent immune cells (UBLIs) and exploit their disease-homing
capabilities, like chemotaxis, to traffic to and accumulate in sites of disease. This approach eliminates the need
for complex and potentially toxic nanoconstructs as a component of drug delivery—only the BL substrate and
PS administration (both non-toxic compounds) will be required. Recently, we introduced precision
photomedicine using a targeted, activatable PS that exhibited cellular selectivity and reduced off-target toxicity
in a metastatic cancer model. We will pair the proposed novel light delivery platform with precision
photomedicine for maximal benefit. First, we will optimize the BL-PDT platform in 3D cancer–immune cell co-
cultures across biologically and clinically relevant parameter spaces informed by Monte Carlo simulations.
Then we will demonstrate the approach in vivo by intravenous injection of UBLIs into an in vivo xenograft
model of cancer metastases informed by in vitro results. These proof-of-concept studies will enable
comprehensive safety and efficacy studies in multiple disease models in future funding periods. Ultimately, we
envision clinical translation involving extraction and engineering of patient immune cells, similar to chimeric
antigen redirected (CAR) T cell therapy, followed by reinfusion and administration of photomedicine. This new
therapeutic paradigm has potential to benefit many diseases in cancer and beyond, which justifies the high-
risk, high-reward nature of the proposal.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
Dravet Syndrome (DS) is a devastating form of epilepsy caused by loss of function of NaV1.1 (80-90% of cases),
the predominant voltage-gated Na+ channel expressed in inhibitory (GABAergic) interneurons in the
hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. This causes a decrease in the release of inhibitory neurotransmitter (GABA),
resulting in hyperexcitability. The disease manifests itself within the first year of life and is usually triggered by
hyperthermia causing frequent and prolonged seizures that result in a host of health problems including
developmental delay, speech impairment, ataxia, hypotonia and sleep disturbances.
 Two small molecule monotherapies have been approved recently by the FDA: Epidiolex (Cannabidiol or
CBD) in 2018 and Fintepla (fenfluramine or FA) in 2020 for patients two years of age and older. Even though
they reduce the frequency of seizures, these drugs at their effective dosages cause multiple side effects. Their
mechanism(s) of action to reduce epileptiform activity remain(s) unknown.
 G protein-gated inwardly rectifying K+ (GIRK) channels have been strongly implicated in epilepsy. They are
activated by the Gβγ dimer of G proteins and by [Na+]i in a synergistic manner. The basis of synergism lies in
that they each work allosterically to control predominantly the two channel gates: Gβγ, the membrane gate and
Na+, the cytosolic gate. In the case of the GABAergic interneurons, we hypothesize that NaV1.1 and GIRK1/2
are coupled, such that the Na+ entering through NaV1.1 promotes GIRK1/2 activity to hyperpolarize the cell and
ensure removal of NaV1.1 inactivation for fast spiking. In DS this mechanism becomes compromised causing
cell depolarization and inactivation of voltage-gated channels at large present in GABAergic neurons failing to
compensate for the loss of NaV1.1. We use GAT1508, a specific activator of GIRK1/2 to compensate for the
compromised Na+ entry. Since GAT1508 opens the cytosolic gate, we ask whether it synergizes with CBD (via
CB1R) and FA (via 5-HT1DR) to open more fully the membrane gates. In Aim 1, experiments designed to test
the hypothesis are aimed at the cellular level in both heterologous expression and in native GABAergic neurons.
In Aims 2 and 3, we utilize a DS mouse model, heterozygous for the Scn1a gene that encodes NaV1.1, and in
Aim 2, we test the hypothesis at the brain slice level, where synapses and transmitter release remain intact, and
compare the DS model to a wild-type animal model. In Aim 3, we pursue experiments at the whole animal level
(DS model), using simultaneous EEG and 2-photon microscopy to monitor the neuronal circuits involved.

The control of movement, in spite of its seemingly effortless execution, belies a complex, multi-level collective of
neuromuscular interactions tuned and coordinated through sensory experience. Efficient and flexible behavior
in everyday contexts requires neural mechanisms that support rapid updating whenever objects around us, or
even our own movements, are disrupted during ongoing motion. As a movement unfolds, the need for predictive
or responsive control to correct for contextual perturbations changes. For example, the early stages of an action
typically exhibit fast responses to perturbations, suggesting the existence of feed-forward processes that use
internal models to predict the sensory consequences. On the other hand, later phases appear to employ
continuous sensory feedback to adjust movements. While much is known about updating for postural and arm
movements, very little is understood about the neural mechanisms of updating of dexterous movements of the
hand as we interact with objects. While the reach-to-grasp cortical anatomy is well described, the causal
functional roles of the regions still remain elusive. In particular, it is now becoming clear that the dominant
framework which describes reach-to-grasp control as being under the control of independent frontoparietal
channels is untenable because it does not explain recent empirical neurophysiological findings. Therefore, the
current project aims to leverage non-invasive stimulation to induce transient cortical perturbations, paired with
visual perturbations to the task goal and mechanical perturbations of the internal state of the limb, to causally
evaluate the contributions of four critical brain regions in components of the reach-to-grasp action. The
information derived from this work will provide a more solid background for our understanding of the functional
organization of the frontoparietal reach-to-grasp network and, by extension, of hand-arm control coordination.
This project will advance our empirical understanding of how dexterous updating of the upper limb, in particular
reach-to-grasp actions, are orchestrated by the brain. The knowledge will be immediately applicable and
translatable for rehabilitation of upper limb recovery in stroke and other similar disorders, by using error
augmentation through visual and haptic platforms to facilitate skill reacquisition and identifying cortical targets
for non-invasive neuromodulatory stimulation. These findings will be relevant to the mission of the NIH, with
broad interest to clinicians and basic scientists, and will have direct

Community-based Design and Evaluation of A Conversational Agent to Promote SARS-
COV2 Vaccination in Black Churches
African Americans have suffered a disproportionate burden from COVID-19, with significantly
higher rates of infection, hospitalization, and mortality compared to Whites. These findings may
be compounded by the fact that African Americans are also at higher risk for vaccine hesitancy.
As limited health literacy has been identified as a key mediator of racial and ethnic disparities,
interventions that address health literacy barriers have the potential to ameliorate these
disparities. Over the past decade we have developed and tested embodied conversational agents
(ECA) — computer characters that simulate face-to-face counseling using voice, hand gesture,
gaze cues and other nonverbal behavior, and successfully used them in health behavior
interventions for populations with low health literacy. We have developed ECA-based
interventions to address a wide range of health problems among low literacy populations,
including physical activity, diet, and medication adherence promotion, providing access to and
explanation of healthcare documents, and collection of family health histories. In this project, we
propose to create an effective and sustainable smartphone-based ECA intervention designed to
deliver personalized and tailored education about SARS-CoV-2 and Influenza vaccination. We
will collaborate with the Black Ministerial Alliance TenPoint (BMATP) of Greater Boston to develop
the intervention app and evaluate it in a clinical trial involving 600 congregants from 12
predominately African American churches. Our primary hypothesis is that participants will have
significantly greater SARS-CoV-2 and Influenza vaccination series completion at 6 months (H1)
and 12 months (H2) in versions of the app that promote engagement and incorporate spiritual
tailoring. Our secondary hypotheses are that, among participants who have not been vaccinated,
those in the high engagement and tailored conditions will have significant improvements in intent
to obtain SARS-CoV-2 and Influenza vaccination and attitudes towards SARS-CoV-2 and
Influenza vaccination.

Mammalian cells expend large amounts of energy into generating enzyme-mediated RNA chemical
modifications that can change the base-pairing, RNA structure, or recruitment of RNA-binding proteins, among
other elusive roles. Pseudouridine (ψ)-modified mRNAs are more thermodynamically stable, more resistant to
RNAse-mediated degradation, and have the potential to modulate immunogenicity and enhance translation in
vivo. However, ψ detection is extremely challenging: ψ modifications do not affect Watson-Crick base pairing
and are indistinguishable from uridine when using hybridization-based methods. Further, since ψ is an isomer
of uridine, detection using mass spectrometry requires non-quantitative chemical derivatization methods. While
recent studies have shown that RNA modifications can be detected through direct RNA nanopore sequencing
by monitoring basecalling errors, we have recently shown that the accuracy and fidelity of this approach is
relatively low and sequence dependent. Our team has recently used a ligation approach to produce synthetic
mRNA controls that contain single ψ sites within relevant transcripts mammalian cells. Using these synthetic
controls we performed nanopore-based RNA sequencing and developed computational tools that increase the
accuracy of ψ-calling to 90+%, depending on the specific sequence. We are basing our work on our recent
finding that achieving ψ quantification requires sequence-specific training using unique signal parameters. The
initial success of our team has laid the foundation to 1) generate an expanded set of barcoded synthetic RNA
constructs that contain single ψ sites, 2) obtain a rigorous set of quadruplicate nanopore runs with ~50,000
single-molecule reads per construct, 3) develop computational tools to allow highly accurate sequence-specific
ψ-calling. We will develop a gold-standard set of synthetic mRNA transcripts as a training molecular set for
quantitative ψ profiling in direct RNA nanopore sequencing of human transcriptomes. The molecular set will
allow quantitative profiling of hundreds of putative ψ sites across mammalian samples.
This proposal will serve an unmet need by addressing a critical bottleneck: the lack of available modified RNA
modification gold standards, i.e., RNA molecules that contain a site-specific and structure-specific modification.
In this collaborative project we will develop a complete pipeline for synthesis of gold standard molecules; use
these molecules to measure the nanopore signals that ψ modifications produce; develop a machine-learning
tool to accurately quantify these modifications; profile site-specific ψ modifications in various cell lines to obtain
ψ-maps that can be used to assess relationships of ψ modifications with phenotypes.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
Binocular vision relies on a synergy between sensory and motor fusional mechanisms that jointly construct a
single percept of the environment from the differing images formed on the two retinae. A stereoscopic sensory
representation of the environment is required for accurate binocular eye movements, which in turn are required
for stereoscopic sensory vision. A failure in either component of this system, especially during development, can
lead to permanent binocular vision impairment. Sensory impairments can include amblyopia, diplopia and
suppression, oculomotor impairments can include strabismus and vergence insufficiency, while socio-economic
sequelae include lost education, sport and job opportunities and elevated adverse health risks. The current
treatments for amblyopia (occlusion and penalization) are primarily monocular and do not promote binocular
perception or eye movement coordination. Similarly, treatments for strabismus do not typically address binocular
perception. These limitations are at least partly due to a lack of practical methodologies for the assessment of
sensory-motor function and partly due to a lack of coordinated sensory-motor therapies.
Recent data show that there is significant plasticity in both sensory systems and motor systems, even in adults.
Many groups are now exploring methods to promote sensory plasticity with digitally modified images in
dichoptic games and movies, but considerably less attention has been directed to motor plasticity or sensory
and motor plasticity together. We hypothesize that additional therapeutic gains and a lower risk of adverse side
effects may be achieved with a combined sensory-motor therapeutic approach that is monitored by effective
sensory-motor endpoints. We argue i) that the pace of commercialization of virtual reality therapies for
anisometropic amblyopia intensifies the need simultaneously to understand sensory and oculomotor deficits in
strabismic amblyopia and ii) that the high levels of recidivism following surgical intervention may benefit from
combined sensorimotor rehabilitation. In Aim 1, we develop and evaluate efficient methods to measure sensory
and motor deficits in people with binocular vision impairment and to provide a quantitative framework for
evidence-based assessment of sensory-motor therapy. In Aim 2, we measure the impact across the visual field
of strabismus on the three-dimensional representation of virtual and natural environments to understand how
the distribution of naturally occurring depth statistics across the visual field may impact the development of
binocular sensory and motor deficits and moderate their response to treatment. In Aim 3, we develop and
evaluate feedback-based methods that aim to facilitate and maintain ocular alignment and examine the
potential benefit of simultaneous sensory and motor interventions for binocular visual function. In each Aim, we
employ both laboratory stimuli, because of their high level of control, and natural and virtual 3D scenes,
because of their rich structure and relevance to real-world deficits. The overall goal is to demonstrate the
theoretical foundation for combined sensory and motor therapeutic approaches to binocular visual dysfunction.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：This proposal addresses fundamental issue of specificity and generality of training in the context of Perceptual
Learning (PL). PL broadly encompasses the set of mechanisms through which experience with the
environment gives rise to changes in perceptual processing. The potential broader impacts of PL are immense.
Careful research in this domain can greatly enhance our basic understanding of the perceptual systems and
the plasticity of these systems. Furthermore, translational approaches underpinned by the basic science of PL
are becoming increasingly prominent. This includes a host of emerging translational approaches for the
rehabilitation of both perceptual deficits and for cognitive training, which are believed to share cortical plasticity
mechanisms. However, while existing research provides evidence that PL approaches can improve perceptual
skills, our ability to develop effective interventions is limited by a lack of understanding of the behavioral
outcomes associated with different PL approaches. Here we suggest that to understand and maximally exploit
PL, it is necessary to know how training with different tasks and in different individuals gives rise to different
outcomes. One major obstacle to successful translation of PL is that the field to-date has been strongly driven
by “novel” and “provocative” findings demonstrated via small N studies with very few projects digging deep to
achieve robust and reliable results. In turn, not surprisingly, the field of PL, like many others in psychology, has
suffered from numerous replication challenges. Furthermore, perhaps because following in direct footsteps
runs counter to the tendencies noted above, it is surprisingly rare for different research groups to use identical
training tasks or outcome tests. This is problematic given research showing that small changes in task-
procedures can give rise to large differences in learning outcome. Here we overcome these limitations by
comparing a large number of different training tasks using common outcome measures and in a large subject
population. Each of these tasks involves a different “critical feature” for learning proposed by a given research
group. However, these tasks have never been directly compared or contrasted. The outcome of the proposed
research will be of tremendous value to both basic understanding of PL as well as how to translate PL to help
those with visual needs. We will achieve robust and reliable results by training a large sample of participants
on PL tasks and assess the outcomes via a common set of measures. We will also collect a broad assessment
of individual differences, which will provide a unique dataset that can resolve controversies in the literature and
lead to new understandings. Our proposed analytical approach tests central key hypothesis in the field,
explores the extent to which different training approaches leads to systematically different profiles of learning,
and examines how these can differ based upon the individuals being trained. Further by releasing our training
and testing tools as well as the data collected, we will enable other groups to model results, replicate our
studies, and make well specified modifications of training tasks with known outcomes to guide future research.

Acute and chronic wildland fire smoke inhalation have been linked to increased mortality as well as respiratory
and cardiovascular morbidity, though the extent to which the frequency and duration of exposure or the
chemical and particle profiles of the smoke contribute to the observed health effects remains unknown. As the
occurrences of wildland fires and number of people living at the wildland urban interface (WUI) continue to
increase, prolonged inhalation of wildland fire smoke poses a serious threat to public health. Due to this, there
is an urgent need to better understand the adverse cardiopulmonary outcomes associated with the exposure to
wildland urban smoke. The smoke that arises from wildland fires at the WUI is a complex mixture of gases,
trace metals, and fine and ultrafine particles. The latter are particularly dangerous for human health, since they
deposit in the deep regions of the lungs and may translocate into the blood stream, increasing the oxidative and
inflammatory burden, both locally and systemically. Prolonged inflammation can lead to the development of
obstructive lung disease and atherosclerosis. To investigate the link between exposure to WUI smoke and
development of cardiopulmonary dysfunction, our interdisciplinary team brings together expertise in fire
generation and characterization, rodent aerosol exposures, respiratory mechanics, lung biology, and
cardiovascular physiology. To fulfill our goals, we will create lab-scale smoke using materials representative of
WUI regions in Southern California and we will deliver it to mice. In Aim 1, we will investigate the role of
frequency and duration of the exposure, as well as particulate concentration of the wildland fire smoke. In Aim
2, we will focus on the relative contribution of different fuel sources characteristic of the WUI. Furthermore, as
part of this ONES early-stage-investigator project, the PI and co-Is will generate an external advisory panel
consisting of inhalation toxicology researchers, public health advocates, and fire protection experts.
Dissemination of new knowledge gained from this proposal to the community will be a vital part of this
endeavor.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
Pediatric feeding disorders are on the rise and are present in 20-50% of typically developing children (1-8) and
in 33-80% of children with developmental delay (9, 10). Furthermore, infants who are born preterm are
particularly at-risk for sucking and feeding difficulties (11, 12). Early non-nutritive suck (NNS) – or sucking
without nutrients being delivered – and feeding skills have been shown to be reliable indicators of central
nervous system (CNS) integrity (18). In fact, delays in sucking and feeding have been reported in
approximately 35-48% of infants with different types of neonatal brain injury (18). Sucking, feeding, speech,
and language all develop in parallel in the first year of life and rely heavily on sensorimotor integration.
However, the link between sucking and feeding skills, CNS function, and development extends beyond the
neonatal period. Emerging retrospective research links neonatal sucking and feeding patterns to subsequent
speech (13) and language (14-17) development in early childhood. Although these behaviors emerge on a
similar timeline and share neural resources and musculature, they are rarely studied together and the links
between them remain unknown. We propose a longitudinal study to sample NNS data at 3, 6, 9, and 12
months of age and speech outcomes at 12, 24, and 36 months of age across full-term (n=85) and moderate to
late preterm (32-37 weeks’ gestational age; n=85) infants. The specific goals of the proposed research are as
follows: (Aim 1) to establish typical patterns of NNS across infants born full-term and preterm in the first year of
life and utilize a functional data analysis to examine infants’ NNS burst waveforms, and (Aim 3) to determine
the ability of NNS to predict subsequent speech development across preterm and full-term infants until age
three. We hypothesize that infant suck will change significantly across the first year of life with infants born
premature performing worse on these measures compared to full-term infants. In addition, we hypothesize that
neonatal suck will predict speech development across preterm and full-term infants. This study provides an
unprecedented level of power in identifying the connection between neonatal sucking and subsequent speech
emergence for several reasons: we will use our (1) innovative, custom and quantitative NNS device to sample
suck across (2) two groups of infants and will (3) utilize functional data analyses to better understand NNS
development and its implications for speech development later in life. (4) We will use standardized and non-
standardized approaches to longitudinally study speech development, which will allow for a more robust and
nuanced understanding of how NNS and speech are connected in infants and children. Overall, this project
captures three years of in-depth oral motor coordination using state-of-the-art methods and collaborators to
answer important theoretical questions. Results generated by this clinically relevant and theoretically driven
study will create a paradigm shift in how clinicians approach feeding and speech therapies in early childhood.

Listeners with hearing impairment can often understand spoken language, but with increased effort, taking
cognitive resources away from other processes such as attention and memory. An important challenge is
therefore to understand how the brain copes with a degraded speech signal and the cognitive processes that
are most critical to successful comprehension. Adult listeners with cochlear implants are a unique group in
which to investigate effortful listening: They have typically adapted to auditory deprivation for a period of years
of profound hearing loss, followed by some degree of hearing restoration following implantation. Following
increased auditory input due to cochlear implantation, the degree to which individual listeners are able to
successfully recognize speech, especially in the presence of background noise, is extremely variable. Previous
attempts to explain this variability in the context of underlying patterns of brain activity have been unsuccessful,
in large part because the technical challenges associated with neuroimaging in the presence of an implanted
medical device have prevented adequate localization of neural responses to speech. The goal of our research
is to understand the cognitive systems that support speech recognition in listeners with cochlear implants and
to use knowledge about these systems to improve behavioral outcomes. We do so using converging evidence
from behavioral measures and functional brain imaging. We make use of high-density diffuse optical
tomography (HD-DOT), a form of optical brain imaging that produces anatomically-localized indices of regional
cortical activity. We will map the brain networks supporting speech comprehension in listeners with cochlear
implants, which we expect to differ from those engaged by listeners with good hearing. We will then evaluate
the degree to which neural markers of effortful listening can predict individual differences in speech recognition
success in the presence of background noise. Together the findings will help ground our understanding of
cochlear implant-aided speech recognition in a neuroanatomically-constrained framework and develop more
accurate outcome measures.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Project Summary
Hematogenous metastasis is responsible for a large majority of cancer-related deaths, where circulating tumor
cells (CTCs) shed from the primary tumor into the peripheral blood (PB). A small number of CTCs may form
secondary sites, which are extremely difficult to control clinically. Most methods for studying CTCs rely on
drawing and analyzing fractionally small PB blood samples (“liquid biopsy”). Although CTCs and multicellular
CTC clusters (CTCCs) have been studied for decades, little is known about their “dynamics” in vivo (transient
changes in their numbers in PB), and how these may affect metastasis development and response to anti-cancer
treatment. For example, it is know that radiation therapy may encourage metastatic dissemination of cancer, yet
the mechanisms for this are still poorly understood.
 Our team recently developed a new method for in vivo enumeration of CTCs in small animals called “diffuse
in vivo flow cytometry” (DiFC). DiFC uses diffuse light to detect fluorescent-protein expressing CTCs in large,
deeply-seated blood vessels. DiFC can sample approximately 100 microliters of blood per minute, permitting
detection of fewer than 1 CTC per mL of PB, and sampling of the entire peripheral blood volume in minutes. We
previously used DiFC to study rare CTC and CTCC dissemination in mouse xenograft models. DiFC revealed
that CTC numbers are highly dynamic and may change by an order-of-magnitude or more over 24 hour periods.
These changes are largely missed by CTC enumeration methods that involve infrequent blood draws.
 The goal of this project is to build a “wearable” tethered w-DiFC instrument that will allow continuous, non-
invasive monitoring of CTC numbers over extended periods in mice. The w-DiFC optical probe and signal
processing design will permit data collection in freely-moving mice in ambient lighting conditions. We will first
use w-DiFC to study CTC dynamics during disease development in an orthotopic xenograft and transgenic mouse
model of metastasis.
 We will use also w-DiFC to measure continuous CTC dynamics after radiation therapy in a medulloblastoma
(MB) mouse model. MB is a common form of childhood brain cancer that aggressively metastasizes to the
leptomeningeal surfaces of the brain and spine via the PB. There is significant evidence that radiation may
exacerbate metastasis by triggering mobilization of CTCs into the blood. We expect that the ability of w-DiFC to
measure CTCs over short-, medium-, and long-term timescales will provide unique insights into this process. We
will also use w-DiFC to study the use of anti-inflammatory drugs to block the pro-metastatic effect. Hence, the
studies proposed here could ultimately lead to better understanding of metastasis and improved treatment
protocols for childhood MB. We anticipate that the unique technologies that will be developed here will have
broad application to other cancers and anti-cancer therapies in the future.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：KRAS is one of the most deadly, yet undrugged, cancer proteins and is present in over 30% of all human
tumors, with even higher frequencies found in pancreatic, lung, thyroid, colon, and liver cancers. Thus, achieving
new mechanistic insights into KRAS deregulation and advancing innovative approaches to neutralize oncogenic
KRAS remain among the highest priorities of the cancer field and represent the focus of this interdisciplinary
proposal. KRAS is a GTPase that serves as a critical control point for a host of cellular functions ranging from
cell survival and proliferation to endocytosis and motility. The functional activity of KRAS is dictated by nucleotide
exchange, with the GTP-bound and GDP-bound forms representing the on and off states, respectively. Cancer
cells hijack and enforce the activated state of KRAS through gain-of-function mutagenesis or gene amplification.
To date, small molecule approaches to directly block the GTP-binding site have been unsuccessful due to
subnanomolar engagement of GTP and GDP by KRAS. The structure of KRAS in complex with SOS1, a guanine
nucleotide exchange factor that enhances KRAS activity by facilitating GDP release, revealed a helix-in-groove
interaction potentially targetable by α-helical mimicry. We applied all-hydrocarbon peptide stapling to generate
stabilized alpha-helices of SOS1 (SAH-SOS1) and identified a prototype compound that engaged oncogenic
KRAS, including the broad diversity of clinical mutants, inhibited the ERK-MAP kinase phosphosignaling cascade
downstream of KRAS, and impaired the viability of KRAS-driven cancer cells. We found that not only did the
prototype SAH-SOS1 construct dissociate the catalytic SOS1/KRAS interaction as anticipated, but also directly
and independently blocked nucleotide association with KRAS by an unknown mechanism. Here, we aim to apply
chemical, structural, cellular, and in vivo approaches to interrogate just how a SAH-SOS1 peptide can directly block
the enzymatic activity of KRAS, compare and contrast this mechanism to the natural agonist activity of the SOS1
protein, and thereby inform both our structure-function understanding of SOS1/KRAS regulation and a new strategy
for therapeutic inhibition of KRAS in human cancer. To achieve these goals, we propose three experimental aims:
(1) Synthesize an expansive library of structurally-reinforced helices modeled after the KRAS-interaction domain
of SOS1 to identify the binding determinants and functional interactions with KRAS and its oncogenic mutants;
(2) Apply hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry to elucidate the conformational effects of the SOS1
protein and SAH-SOS1 peptides on KRAS proteins and thereby define the mechanisms of enzymatic regulation;
(3) Advance optimized SAH-SOS1 inhibitors to cellular and in vivo testing in KRAS-driven cancers to validate
mechanism of action and therapeutic window, and provide proof-of-concept for clinical translation. By combining
the biochemical and mass spectrometry expertise of the Engen laboratory with the cancer chemical biology and
translational approaches of the Walensky laboratory, our goal is to provide new mechanistic insight into the
oncogenic KRAS pathway and inform a new modality to disarm it for therapeutic benefit in cancer.

Evidence suggests that exposure to Superfund chemicals contributes to adverse pregnancy outcomes (APOs),
including preterm birth (PTB). Rates of PTB and infant mortality in Puerto Rico (PR) are among the highest of
all US states and territories. There are 18 Superfund sites in PR, and evidence of contamination of the drinking
water is extensive. Moreover, extreme weather events (hurricanes, flooding) may result in elevated exposures
to Superfund chemicals. The PROTECT center has brought together researchers from Northeastern
University, the University of Puerto Rico, University of Georgia, and the University of Michigan to provide much
needed understanding of the relationship and the mechanisms by which exposure to suspect chemicals
contribute to APOs, and to develop new methods to reduce risk of exposure in PR and beyond. To do this,
PROTECT uses a source-to-outcome structure, integrating epidemiological (Project 1), toxicological (Project
2), fate and transport (Project 3), and remediation (Project 4) studies, a unified sampling infrastructure, a
centralized indexed data repository, and a sophisticated data management system.
Since its inception in 2010, PROTECT has built detailed and extensive data sets on environmental conditions
and prenatal conditions of 1457 pregnant mothers (exposure, socioeconomic and health data–close to 3000
data points per participant), yielding a cohort of 1210 live births in northern PR. In the renewal, PROTECT will
recruit and follow an additional 1000 study participants, yielding a cohort of 800+ live births for an ultimate total
cohort of 2000+ completed live births. PROTECT has documented significant contamination of northern PR
drinking water and has found compelling preliminary epidemiologic and mechanistic toxicology associations
between Superfund chemicals and APOs. PROTECT research has focused on chlorinated volatile organic
compounds and phthalates and their role in PTB. The PROTECT renewal will broaden its scope, employing a
data-driven approach to study and reduce the impact of exposure to mixtures of suspect chemicals
from Superfund sites in karst regions on APOs in Puerto Rico’s underserved, highly-exposed
population. Target chemicals will be expanded to include metals, pesticides, and polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons. We will investigate the impacts of extreme weather events on contaminant transport and
exposure, and new water treatment technologies will be developed for portable and robust water treatment
systems. The PROTECT renewal will also focus on oxidative stress as an underlying biological pathway by
which contaminant exposure can lead to APOs. New statistical methods and data mining, machine learning,
and visualization tools will be developed to allow PROTECT researchers to analyze our datasets. PROTECT
will employ innovative approaches to engage and educate the community, involve study participants, report-
back data, and communicate with stakeholders. A broad suite of training and professional activities will be
provided to trainees, individually tailored to the trainees’ needs and goals.

My long-term career goal is to become an independent pharmacist researcher with expertise in psychiatric
multimorbidity research in cardiovascular disease. Through my research program I aim to identify factors that
influence the health and medication taking behaviors of older adults with psychiatric multimorbidity using “real
world” observational data and direct patient and stakeholder engagement. I have clinical (PharmD) and graduate
(PhD) training in pharmacy and I am an assistant professor at Northeastern University in the Department of
Pharmacy and Health Systems Sciences. Training facilitated by this K01 award will help me achieve my long-
term career goal by building on my clinical and technical skills as a pharmacist and researcher and providing me
with the protected time necessary to expand my expertise in longitudinal data analysis, mixed methods and
patient-centered research in cardiovascular disease and multimorbidity. I have assembled an outstanding,
committed, and interdisciplinary team of nationally renowned experts in fields relevant to the proposed research
and my long-term goals. My training plan complements my prior training and experience and incorporates
interaction with mentors, formal coursework, hands-on training, workshops, conferences and research activities.
Using a mixed methods design, my proposal seeks to build and expand on my preliminary work completed in
partnership with the ongoing NHLBI funded study, Systematic Assessment of Geriatric Elements in Atrial
Fibrillation (SAGE-AF). I will leverage observational data, currently being collected in SAGE-AF, to evaluate the
longitudinal impact of psychiatric multimorbidity (i.e., dyads and the triad of depression, anxiety and cognitive
impairment) on oral anticoagulant (OAC) use and outcomes in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). I will examine
relationships between psychiatric multimorbidity and clinical outcomes such as bleeding and medication
adherence. I will also examine relationships between psychiatric multimorbidity and patient reported outcomes
that are not readily available in the medical record but are increasingly important to patients, their families and
clinicians such as patient satisfaction and health-related quality of life. Then, I will conduct focus groups of SAGE-
AF participants (92% report willingness to continue in SAGE-AF) and stakeholders to understand protective
factors that influence anticoagulation success among patients with psychiatric multimorbidity, including factors
that are not evaluated in the SAGE-AF data. The specific aims are to: 1) Examine the relationship between
psychiatric multimorbidity and OAC prescribing in AF; 2) Among OAC users, examine longitudinal associations
between psychiatric multimorbidity and OAC success indicators and patient reported outcomes over 2 years;
and 3) Conduct 6-8 qualitative focus groups including SAGE-AF participants, their caregivers and their clinicians,
to identify factors that influence OAC success. This proposal aligns with NHLBI’s overarching objective 3 by
investigating factors that account for differences in health among populations and has high potential to identify
factors that can be useful targets for patient-centered interventions.

Title: New Computational Systems Biology Methods for Modeling Gene Regulatory Circuits
One of the biggest challenges in biology is to elucidate complex gene interactions and networks for the purpose
of developing interventions in human disease. Particularly important are those gene networks that control cellular
state transitions (e.g., replicative to quiescent, epithelial to mesenchymal, etc.). Thanks to the emergence of
next-generation sequencing technology, rich data resources are available for mapping gene regulatory
interactions. However, the field still lacks a systems-level understanding of how genes in a network collectively
perform their functions and control cellular state transitions, information that is critical for informed clinical
intervention. The PI’s long-term goal is to design effective computer-aided strategies for predicting therapeutic
interventions by integrating knowledge of gene regulatory networks, genomics data from patients, and systems-
biology model simulations. So far, numerous computational methods have been developed to infer and model
gene regulatory networks. However, they typically suffer from the following issues. First, current approaches are
still ineffective to choose an appropriate set of genes and regulatory interactions in a network to model. Current
approaches infer regulatory relationships based on association of gene expression signals, but generally don't
also consider whether an inferred gene regulatory network can operate as a functional dynamical system driving
expected transitions between the network states. Second, traditional mathematical modeling is hard to be applied
systematically to large systems, because many kinetic parameters are unmeasurable directly from experiments,
especially in vivo. The parameter uncertainty and the potential risk of overfitting in large systems have limited
the predictive power of systems biology. To address these issues, the PI’s research program will develop a suite
of computational systems biology algorithms to construct and model high-quality core regulatory circuits driving
cellular state transitions. We have recently developed enhanced ensemble-based mathematical modeling
algorithms for simulating network behaviors without the need of detailed kinetic parameters. This advance has
allowed an integrated top-down and bottom-up systems-biology modeling, as evident from the PI’s recently
developed network reconstruction and modeling method NetAct and network coarse-graining algorithm
SacoGraci. The PI’s research program will further advance novel technologies of ensemble-based modeling and
their applications to optimize high-quality systems-biology models that capture cellular state transitions. The
algorithms will be benchmarked and refined using in-silico simulated data, publicly available omics data sets,
and data from collaborations, with a focus on cell differentiation in developmental processes and state transitions
in oncogenesis. Success of the research program will result in a comprehensive toolkit that will unveil the gene
regulatory mechanism of cellular state transitions. The algorithmic development is expected to have a broad
impact on not only basic research in systems biology but also shed light on therapeutic intervention in genomic
medicine.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Advances in genome technologies ushered in vast cost reductions in DNA sequencing and increased read
lengths, the latter afforded by development of new single-molecule sequencing technologies. As a result, much
of the genome’s “dark matter” has been elucidated, and higher-quality reference genomes were made available.
In addition to genome sequencing, these single-molecule methods have enabled new applications for probing
chemical modifications in DNA, by either probing the kinetics of sequencing-by-synthesis using optical
waveguides, or by electrically distinguishing modified bases using nanopores.
Despite progress, a critical barrier in genomics is understanding the roles of RNA in biology, which demands
methods for quantitative analysis of RNA molecules in a cell. The myriad of types of RNAs in a cell, their dynamic
chemical modifications, and their elaborate structural and functional diversity, all hint at a tremendous level of
regulation and biological significance. Traditional RNA sequencing methods have primarily relied on conversion
to complementary DNA (cDNA) followed by cDNA sequencing using either high-throughput second-generation
methods or third generation single-molecule methods, the latter of which offers long reads. Using these methods,
some RNA modifications can be read through prior chemical functionalization of the RNA prior to conversion to
cDNA (for example, m6A, pseudouridine, A-to-I editing, 1-methyluridine, and dihydrouridine). However, the
chemical reactions involved in these methods are not 100% quantitative or specific, and further, detection is
often done through incomplete reads due to reverse transcription blocks, which precludes detection of multiple
modifications. The only available method for direct RNA sequencing, the Oxford Nanopore Technologies
platform, suffers from several drawbacks that include high input requirements, limited ability to probe RNA
modifications, and incomplete reads, particularly near the RNA 5’ end.
We address these limitations by developing a new single-molecule method that can be scaled to allow long read
direct RNA sequencing at high throughputs, all with very low input requirements of several picograms. Building
on zero-mode waveguides (ZMWs) originally developed by Pacific Biosciences, we have recently developed
electro-optical ZMWs (eZMWs) that allow low-input capture of DNA and RNA molecules. We demonstrated using
these devices identification of DNA fragments from low inputs by rapid capture of single molecules and their
flash sequencing. Together with the Pyle group, we are developing the integration of MarathonRT, an ultra-
processive reverse transcriptase that converts RNA molecules to cDNA molecules with high processivity and
accuracy, into our electro-optical eZMWs for direct RNA sequencing. We have already fused MarathonRT to a
streptavidin protein and demonstrated its functionality in eZMWs. Here we will build on these developments to
develop a direct RNA sequencing method that can detect single base edits and chemical modifications, all with
high coverage from single-cell inputs of a few pg per run.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Summary
 Injuries to the growth plate (GP) remain a major cause of morbidity in children, often leading to angular
limb deformities and even complete growth arrest. Slipped Capital Femoral Epiphysis (SCFE), a transverse
Salter-Harris type 1 (SH1) fracture, where the spherical femoral head of the hip joint slips backwards off the
femoral neck, is a common and debilitating disorder, affecting the hip in children and adolescents and often
culminating in painful arthritis in adults. A vertical Salter Harris type 2-4 (SH2-4) fracture, in which the fissure
plane extends in the metaphysis or epiphysis, leads to an osseous bridge formation in lieu of cartilage, and
angular deformities. This highlights the need for novel therapeutic strategies to prevent bone formation
at the injury site and to allow epiphyseal cartilage to resume growth. One avenue to promote local
cartilage repair, would be through mobilization of resident stem cells in response to injury. Current literature
describes the GP-RZ as a stem cell-rich region, which give rise to the GP appositionally. We recently
discovered that a population of FoxA2+ long-term stem cells (LTSSC) is located in the top compartment of the
RZ. FoxA2+LTSSC have higher longevity, clonogenicity, and are mutually exclusive with the previously
characterized PTHrP+ short-term stem cells (STSSC), located at the bottom of the RZ.
 A horizontal SH1 injury successfully heals with hyaline cartilage and involves the expansion of FoxA2+
LTSSC. A large vertical SH4 fracture heals through a "bony bar", while a small SH4 lesion heals with hyaline
cartilage. FoxA2+ LTSSC line the outside of a large SH4 wound, but infiltrate the small SH4 lesion. This
suggests other cell types (e.g osteoprogenitors) may create a physical barrier or a signaling niche, which
hinders FoxA2+ LTSSC healing of large defects. In both injuries, a transient pulse of TGFβ signaling, induced
in cartilage remnants at D1, precedes FoxA2+ LTSSC expansion at D3. This indicates a potential role for
TGFβ, in promoting FoxA2+ LTSSC expansion and differentiation into chondrogenic progeny, for cartilage
repair. These findings will allow us to investigate, for the first time, whether FoxA2+LTSSC contribute to GP
cartilage repair following SH1 and SH4 injuries.
 To test this premise, we propose three aims. In Aim 1, we will determine if FoxA2+ cells can contribute
to the repair of a small SH4 lesion, but fail to contribute to the repair of a large SH4 lesion. In Aim 2, we will
determine if TGFβ signaling drives FoxA2+LTSSC migration and differentiation into progeny to accommodate
cartilage repair after SH1 injury. In Aim 3, we will determine if FoxA2+cells transplantation in a large SH4
lesion can prevent formation of a bony bar. Altogether, these results will provide a strong basis for
development of bioengineering strategies for GP cartilage regeneration.

The National Academy of Medicine and the National Institute of Mental Health have described a critical shortage
of child and adolescent psychiatrists (CAPs) who pursue research as a major part of their career. Several efforts
have sought to increase the number of CAP researchers, but the workforce remains insufficient to translate
rapidly emerging genetic, developmental neurobiology, and epidemiology findings into the clinic. We are
determined to improve the yield of researchers for our field by developing an R25-funded research track that is
focused specifically on child and adolescent psychiatry residency. Here, we propose to create the Research
Education in Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (RE-CAP) research track within the NewYork-Presbyterian
Hospital / Weill Cornell / Columbia University / New York State Psychiatric Institute CAP residency, the largest
program in the U.S. With our multiple institution partnership, we are able draw from our two top-ten psychiatry
residency programs, in addition to recruiting promising trainees from across the country. Fulfilling the stated goal
of the NIMH R25 mechanism (PAR-20-094) to “develop, maintain, and expand the interest and ability of
psychiatry residents to conduct research…”, we will provide enhanced exposure to clinical and translational
research in the first year of CAP residency in order to develop and expand interest in research. The R25 funding
will permit a select group of residents to extend their second year of clinical training into two years, while receiving
greater than 50% protected time for research. Intensive mentorship from world-class scientists at Columbia
University or Weill Cornell Medical College will provide them substantial momentum to enter a competitive
postdoctoral research fellowship and sustain a trajectory toward a research career.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Project Summary. Septal-hypothalamic neuronal activity centrally mediates aggressive behavior, while the
monoamine neurotransmitters dopamine and serotonin play strong and mostly opposing modulatory roles.
However, related circuit mechanisms and ontogeny are largely unknown. Making progress towards circuit
mechanism, we found in mice that dopamine input from the ventral tegmental area to the lateral septum is
sufficient for promoting aggression and necessary for establishing baseline aggression. Within the lateral
septum, dopamine acts on D2 receptors to inhibit GABA neurons that project to the hypothalamus. These
findings effectively link the clinically pertinent hyper-dopamine model of aggression with the classic septal-
hypothalamic aggression axis. Making progress towards ontogeny, we identified a sensitive developmental
window during adolescence where dopamine transporter blockade permanently increases adult aggression,
impulsivity, and behavioral stimulant response, and in parallel leads to a hyperactive dopamine system.
Conversely, periadolescent serotonin transporter blockade reduces aggression and behavioral stimulant
response in adulthood, and in parallel leads to a hypoactive dopamine system. Here we will continue this line of
research and study the overarching hypothesis that developmental DA and 5-HT signaling tunes DA input
into the LS and NAc to impact aggression-related behaviors in adulthood. In Aim 1, we investigate the
causal role of dopamine input into the nucleus accumbens in aggression-related behavior. Aggression is
behaviorally classified into reactive aggression which occurs impulsively in response to perceived external threat
and proactive aggression that is premeditated and directly motivated by a drive for appetitive reward. We
hypothesize that nucleus accumbens input contributes to the appetitive value in proactive aggression. In Aim 2,
we test the hypothesis that D2 receptors of the lateral septum contribute to sexual dimorphic differences in
aggressive behavior. We already found D2 receptors mediate dopamine-promoted aggression in male mice as
well as sexual dimorphism for D2 receptor expression. Furthermore, dopamine input into the lateral septum is
not sufficient to trigger aggression in females. In Aim 3, we investigate the causal role of serotonin input into the
lateral septum and nucleus accumbens in aggression-related behavior. Finally, in Aim 4, we investigate if
permanently altered DAergic input into the LS and NAc drives the aggression phenotypes after dopamine and
serotonin transporter blockade during development, by monitoring pathway-specific dopaminergic activity during
behavior, paired with optogenetic rescue experiments. By mapping circuits to behavior in the context of sensitive
developmental period interference, we will advance our understanding of normal as well as disrupted brain
development and function. Such information will impact the understanding of human risk factors for maladaptive
aggression and dopamine dysfunction. With the novel mechanistic and translational insight, we seek to inform
clinical and epidemiological studies and improve diagnosis, prevention and treatment strategies for in psychiatry.

 Obesity and the associated metabolic complications including metabolic syndrome and diabetes significantly contribute
to cardiovascular morbidities. The overall goal of this proposal is aimed at identifying cellular mechanisms that link
activation of the G-protein coupled receptor 75 (GPR75) to obesity-driven metabolic and cardiovascular complications. In
the last funding period, we provided strong evidence that GPR75 is the receptor to which 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid
(20-HETE), a vasoactive and pro-inflammatory lipid mediator, binds and through which it triggers its actions. 20-HETE
has been implicated in the development and progression of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases including hypertension,
stroke, myocardial infarction, diabetes and metabolic syndrome. Our recent studies clearly demonstrated that 20-HETE-
mediates vascular dysfunction in hypertension and diet-driven metabolic (e.g., insulin resistance) and cardiovascular (e.g.,
hypertension) complications through its pairing and activation of GPR75. The adipose tissue and the vascular endothelium
are key to the ensuing cardiometabolic disorders in obesity. They both express GPR75 and are prime targets for 20-HETE
bioactions. In the endothelium, 20-HETE, through its binding to GPR75, uncouples eNOS, induces ACE and activates the
NF-κB inflammatory program. 20-HETE stimulates adipocyte hypertrophy and interferes with adipocyte insulin signaling,
glucose homeostasis and mitochondria function. Endothelial dysfunction in hypertensive subjects and obesity in humans
and animal models are accompanied by several fold increases in circulating 20-HETE levels. Accordingly, it is reasonable
to assume that 20-HETE through its actions on the vascular endothelium and adipose tissue acts as a significant determinant
of obesity-driven cardiovascular and metabolic complications. Importantly, in a large-scale exome sequencing of ~600,000
individuals, we revealed that loss of function GPR75 variants are associated with leanness and protection from obesity
(Science, 2021). This finding, which has been validated in Gpr75 null mice (Science, 2021 and Preliminary Results),
compellingly implicates the 20-HETE-GPR75 pairing in the pathogenesis of obesity and its cardiometabolic complications
and calls for identification of the underlying mechanisms. Consequently, we hypothesized that 20-HETE-GPR75 pairing
promotes diet-driven cardiometabolic complications (e.g., hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, hypertension) by a
mechanism that impairs endothelial and adipocyte function. We further argue that 20-HETE-GPR75 pairing
governs a crosstalk between adipocytes and endothelial cells which contributes to cardiovascular and metabolic
complications in obesity. This hypothesis will be tested in three specific aims that assess the contribution of endothelial-
and adipocyte-specific Gpr75 to diet-driven obesity and examine potential mechanisms governing endothelial-adipocyte
crosstalk that are dependent on 20-HETE-GPR75 pairing.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in the U.S., with the annual total cost of care
estimated at $351 billion. Vascular calcification is a nontraditional CVD risk factor associated with a significant
increase in morbidity and mortality in the general population. Unlike other established risk factors, it is not yet
regarded as a modifiable factor. However, there is emerging evidence that it may drive the pathogenesis of
atherosclerosis and play an important role in the regression of atherosclerotic plaques. Our data demonstrated
that overexpression of tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNAP) in endothelial cells accelerated
coronary atherosclerosis in hyperlipidemic mice, while the TNAP inhibitor SBI-425 reduced manifestations of
coronary artery disease in this model. Subendothelial microcalcification was frequently observed in the internal
elastic lamina in mice and in human arteries and was predicted by computational fluid structure interaction
(FSI) modeling to redistribute wall shear stress on the endothelium. The idea that calcification can promote
atherosclerosis was further supported by an observation of increased low density lipoprotein (LDL) uptake by
endothelial cells cultured on surfaces textured with hydroxyapatite particles. More evidence from mouse
models showed that TNAP activity in macrophages was sufficient to increase calcification during progression
of atherosclerosis and interfere with plaque regression, leading to maladaptive dilation of the aortic root.
We hypothesize that calcification is a modifiable factor in atherosclerosis and that inhibiting TNAP-mediated
vascular calcification may have therapeutic value. The overarching goal of this project is to gain a better
understanding of the role of calcification during atherosclerotic lesion initiation, progression, and resolution,
and to determine whether calcification is an active pathogenic factor in atherosclerosis or a mere, likely benign,
secondary response. The project will use computational and in vivo models to delineate hemodynamic
mechanism by which subendothelial microcalcifications increases retention of LDL in the arterial wall. The
effects of the conditional genetic ablation of TNAP in macrophages or an increase of TNAP activity in plasma
will then be tested in a mouse model of familial hypercholesterolemia. Because regression of calcified plaques
can lead to eccentric aortic root remodeling during lipid lowering, we will interrogate whether inhibition of TNAP
with SBI-425 could suppress calcification and alleviate maladaptive remodeling of the aortic root in a mouse
model during reversal of atherosclerosis. In testing TNAP inhibition for its therapeutic utility for atherosclerotic
calcification, we will keep close attention on potential bone side effects by monitoring bone microarchitecture
using micro-computed tomography. The results of this project will establish whether calcification is a
modifiable risk factor in CVD and determine whether systemic TNAP inhibition or elimination of
osteogenic TNAP-expressing macrophages is a viable therapeutic approach in atherosclerosis. The
results of this study will help guide future development of novel therapeutics for this prevalent disease.

An RNA sequence with all its diverse modifications constitutes ‘true’ information content of the RNA. Defects in
RNA modifications account for >100 human diseases, such as breast cancer, type-2 diabetes and obesity,
affecting millions of Americans. Despite its significance, the true sequence of a RNA, i.e., identity and location
of each and every nucleotide building block (modified or not) within a full-length RNA, remains a mystery, mainly
because of the lack of a general method to directly sequence any nucleotide, especially modified nucleotides
(including unknown ones) at single-nucleotide resolution. No existing technology can sequence all modifications
simultaneously to unfold the true RNA sequences at a large scale or the transcriptomic level.
 What complicates RNA modification studies is that >170 modification types have been discovered, and
not all of nucleotide modifications are modified completely to 100% at their RNA sites. They are even
undetectable by NGS-based technologies, which require the conversion of RNA to cDNAs that do not have any
modification information. Tools to map RNA modifications are limited only to a few popular modifications, and
can usually analyze only one modification type at a time. Mass spectrometry (MS) is currently the only technique
that can characterize all RNA modifications; however, conventional MS methods lose information regarding the
location and co-occurrence of modified nucleotides.
 To resolve these outstanding issues, we have recently developed a series of novel next generation mass
spectrometry-based sequencing (NextGen MassSpec-Seq) approaches that can de novo directly sequence
tRNAs without a cDNA and can sequence and quantify all nucleotide modifications simultaneously. For the
duration of this proposal, we will further develop NextGen MassSpec-Seq to sequence tRNAs efficiently in
different cellular and even disease conditions, make it scalable toward high throughput, and expand its
application to simultaneously sequence and map all modifications quantitatively on any RNA type and at the
transcriptomic level. Specifically, we propose to develop MS for large-scale de novo sequencing of full-length
tRNAs, together with all diverse nucleotide modifications (Aim 1), empower MS to simultaneously sequence and
quantify multiple RNA modifications, allowing quantitative mapping at single nucleotide and stoichiometric
precision (Aim 2), scale up NextGen MassSpec-Seq and combine it with high-throughput NGS sequencing for
direct sequencing of diverse RNA modifications at the transcriptomic level (Aim 3). Our tool will address a long-
standing issue of how to reveal the ‘true” RNA sequences and provide a transformative tool for studying RNA
modifications, which will promote better understanding of functions of post-transcriptional modifications and their
correlations to RNA-related diseases and pandemics.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Vascular diseases continue to be a major cause of death in the US and worldwide. It has been proposed that metabolic
reprogramming and increased glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) activity and expression contribute to the
pathogenesis of fatal angioproliferative vasculopathies. Moreover, some studies suggest individuals with a loss-of-
function G6PD (Mediterranean or African) variant – S188F (G6PDS188F; Type A-; severe deficiency) or N126D
(G6PDN126D; Type A; mild deficiency) nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphism – have lower frequencies of
coronary artery disease. However, G6PD-driven pathogenic and G6PD variant-associated protective mechanisms
affecting vascular diseases remain elusive. We therefore propose to determine potential mechanisms, driven by a newly
discovered G6PD isoform in the nucleus of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), that contribute to pathogenic large
artery stiffness and remodeling. Based on strongly supporting preliminary results, we hypothesized that nuclear G6PD
is a modulator of epigenetic modifiers and is a transcription regulator in VSMCs. Consequently, the loss-of-function
G6PD (S188F, N126D) variants block maladaptive modifications of the epigenome, reducing large artery elastance and
remodeling elicited by obesity/metabolic syndrome and balloon-injury. We will test this hypothesis in three specific
aims. In Aim 1, we will test the hypothesis that G6PD and/or G6PD-coordinated redox in the nucleus controls the
expression and activity of epigenetic modifiers (DNA methyltransferases (DNMT) and DNA (TET) and histone
(JARID) demethylases) and transcription of genes that encode proteins involved in regulating the differentiation
(contractile) and dedifferentiation (pro-inflammatory, -thrombotic, and -proliferative) phenotypes in VSMCs. In Aim 2,
we will determine whether loss-of-function G6PD variants detach from epigenetic modifiers to increase DNA
methylation, suppress histone3-lysine4 trimethylation, and reduce transcription of genes that confer maladaptive (pro-
inflammatory, -thrombotic, and -proliferative) properties to VSMCs. In Aim 3, we will determine whether G6PD variant
rats express fewer maladaptive epigenetic (histone3-lysine4 trimethylation) changes and develop less large artery
elastance (stiffness) and vascular remodeling than wild-type rats fed a high-fat diet (a model of obesity/metabolic
syndrome) or subjected to carotid artery balloon-injury. The results from gain-of-function and loss-of-function studies
of this project will reveal the direct effect of G6PD on gene expression associated with pathogenic vascular remodeling
and large artery stiffness, which lead to heart failure and death. We foresee two significant impacts on vascular biology:
[1] linkage of heretofore unknown G6PD-dependent subcellular redox in the nucleus directly to the fundamental
transcriptional mechanics and gene transcription in vascular pathobiology and [2] development of new treatments
targeting redox signaling to reduce large artery stiffness and remodeling.

The initial contact between newly transmitted group A streptococci (GAS) and its human host can be readily
thwarted by antibody (Ab) directed to the appropriate GAS antigens (Ags). To best simulate this
microenvironment, physiological (i.e., low) inoculum doses of GAS are essential. The goal of this proposal is to
identify Ags, alone and in combinations representing multicomponent vaccines, that are the most effective
targets of Ab-mediated immunity and collectively can provide worldwide coverage against all GAS strains.
The underlying rationale for the proposed approach rests on two principles: That serum obtained from children
just prior to a new GAS infection lacks protective Ab, and that serum obtained from most adults has at least
low levels of persisting protective Ab. The latter is based on the very low incidence of GAS infection in adults,
likely the result of protective immunity that developed following repeated infections earlier in life. Hypotheses
on protective Ag-specific Ab generated from analysis of pediatric serum (aim 1) are experimentally tested in
mice (aim 2). Pre-infection pediatric serum is analyzed for lack of protective Ab to leading vaccine candidates.
Adult serum is used as a source for purified immunoglobulin (Ig) specific to the vaccine target Ags missing in
susceptible children. Immunodeficient mice are passively immunized with the Ag-specific Ig purified from adults
and challenged with low infective doses of GAS. The Ag-specific Ig that confers protection in mice equates to a
human serum-based correlate of protection (CoP).
Four major forms of GAS disease are modeled in mice and evaluated for protective immunity: upper
respiratory tract infection, impetigo, skin and soft tissue infection and invasive disease. GAS from all three
major subpopulations of strains are tested: throat specialists, skin specialists and generalists. The Ag targets
evaluated are leading vaccine candidates and include broadly and semi-conserved Ags as well as surface and
secreted Ags. If successful, this work will identify a collection of Ag targets that can serve as the basis for
global protection. It will also deliver two new standardized platforms – screening of pre-infection human serum
Ab to GAS Ags and improved mouse models - for future identification and straightforward comparison of
additional GAS vaccine candidates.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Adolescence is a window of vulnerability for the development of schizophrenia and other mental disorders. In
schizophrenia, imaging studies have found that thalamo-prefrontal resting state connectivity is reduced during
adolescence prior to disease onset. This decrease in functional connectivity has been linked to cognitive
symptoms and the etiology of the disorder. For many years, an altered maturation of the prefrontal cortex (PFC)
has been implicated in the cognitive deficits of mental disorders yet the mechanisms that drive PFC maturation
are largely unknown. Because thalamic input activity is important for circuit maturation in sensory cortices, we
hypothesize here that thalamic input activity is also important for prefrontal circuit maturation.
To address whether adolescence is a sensitive time-period during which thalamic activity regulates the
maturation of PFC circuitry, we used mice and compared the effects of reducing activity in the thalamic nuclei
projecting to the PFC during postnatal days P20-50 with that in adulthood (P90-120). We found that inhibiting
the thalamus during adolescence leads to a long-lasting decrease in the density of thalamo-mPFC projections
and a reduced excitatory drive to mPFC neurons. Adolescent thalamic inhibition further causes cognitive deficits
in attentional set shifting during adulthood that are associated with disrupted correlated neuronal activity and
task outcome encoding in the mPFC. In contrast, thalamic inhibition during adulthood has no long-lasting
consequences on mPFC excitation, correlated activity, outcome encoding and behavior. Strikingly, exciting the
thalamus in adulthood during the set shifting task rescues in vivo neuronal activity and cognitive deficits induced
by adolescent inhibition.
While these data point to adolescence as a sensitive time window for PFC circuit maturation the underlying
mechanisms by which adolescent inhibition impairs mPFC maturation are still unclear. To address this, first, the
development of mPFC circuitry needs to be characterized during adolescence. Second, it will be important to
determine whether adolescent inhibition induces long-lasting changes in intrinsic mPFC circuitry, and which
specific mPFC projections and interneurons are regulated by adolescent thalamic inhibition. Third, it will be
important to know when such changes arise and how they relate to the changes in in vivo cross correlated activity
and outcome encoding. Our data further suggest that boosting thalamic activity could provide a strategy for
rescuing cognitive deficits in neurodevelopmental disorders. However, as presented, the beneficial effect only
occurs while the thalamus is stimulated. Therefore, strategies will need to be identified that allow for a longer
lasting rescue of the cognitive abilities. We will address these questions using three aims: Aim 1: To determine
when and where adolescent thalamic activity regulates the development of mPFC circuit connectivity. Aim 2: To
determine whether the impact of adolescent thalamic inhibition on cognition requires maturation of the mPFC.
Aim 3. To determine whether thalamic excitation can lead to a long-lasting rescue of the cognitive deficit.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
Cognitive flexibility allows an individual to adapt established thinking patterns and behavioral responses to novel
situations that may require new approaches than those that were previously learned in order to be solved
correctly. Cognitive flexibility is therefore necessary to flexibly adjust ones thinking and behavior instead of
ruminating over thoughts and worries, or instead of showing habitual behavior that may not be productive to
effectively engage with a new situation or to solve a new problem. Impairments in cognitive flexibility can occur
as a result of chronic stress, which is a major contributor to the pathogenesis of many psychiatric disorders.
Accordingly, cognitive flexibility deficits are common across a wide range of mental illnesses and often
unresponsive to otherwise effective medication. Moreover, individuals with high levels of cognitive flexibility have
been shown to cope better with day-to-day stressors, and to be less vulnerable to developing psychiatric
disorders. If we can understand the neural circuits underlying cognitive flexibility, we may be able to identify new
targets for advanced therapeutics to treat the debilitating cognitive impairments of many psychiatric disorders.
In this proposal, we will study a novel neural circuit component underlying one important form of cognitive
flexibility: reversal learning. We will specifically investigate how neural projections from the ventral hippocampus
to the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) regulate reversal learning and stress resilience. In Aim 1, we will inhibit direct
input projections from the ventral hippocampus to the medial OFC, and output projections from the medial OFC
to the lateral OFC, to test if this circuit is functionally important for reversal learning. In Aim 2, we will use in vivo
Ca2+ imaging of neural activity in ventral hippocampus, medial OFC, and lateral OFC, to examine for the first
time how neurons in these brain regions store, process, and update information about action-outcome value
associations that are important for reversal learning. In Aim 3, we will then investigate how these same brain
regions become dysfunctional under conditions of chronic stress, and if stimulating this circuitry can confer stress
resilience and counteract stress-induced deficits in reversal learning. Together, these experiments will provide
first insight into a new element of the neural circuitry underlying cognitive flexibility and stress resilience, which
has great potential to reveal new neural circuit-based targets for novel drugs or for advanced cognitive-behavioral
therapies aimed at improving cognitive flexibility in patients suffering from psychiatric disorders.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：The aim of the current proposal is to test the hypothesis that signaling through 5-HT1A
receptors in the medial prefrontal cortex during adolescence is important for establishing
lifelong motivation. Prior work suggests that disruption of the serotonin system during
early post-natal development in animal models results in altered anxiety and mood
related behaviors in the full-grown adult animal. One receptor that is particularly relevant
in this regard is the 5-HT1A receptor. Recent data from our lab suggests that loss of
serotonin signaling through 5-HT1A receptors in the medial prefrontal cortex during
adolescence but not during adulthood, results in decreased motivation related behavioral
setpoints. We hypothesize that this is true for both appetitive and avoidance motivation.
The current proposal both examines mechanisms through which altered serotonin
signaling through 5-HT1A receptors in adolescence leads to changes in motivation and
further elucidates the specific nature of the reinforcement related behavior that is
affected. In addition to a loss of function, we will use a biased 5-HT1A agonist as a gain
of function approach bi-directionally modulate 5-HT1A signaling Using slice physiology,
we will assess whether 5-HT1A expressing neurons alter their intrinsic properties as a
result of the disrupted 5-HT1A mediated signaling, or whether there are compensatory
changes in circuit properties resulting from the disruption. Using fiber photometry, we
will determine how the medial prefrontal cortex engages with other circuit nodes like the
dorsal raphe nucleus in tasks that tax motivational systems, with the goal of
understanding the circuit basis for the disrupted behavior. Finally, we will directly
assess whether the sensitivity of mPFC pyramidal neurons to inputs during adolescence
is the critical factor in establishing later motivation. We will do this by manipulating
mPFC principal neuron activity during the sensitive period in adolescence using
DREADDS. Understanding how mPFC plasticity in adolescence can be harnessed to
modulate motivation is a potentially promising strategy for addressing disorder that
emerge in adolescence and often include a prominent motivational component.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Overgeneralization is a cognitive impairment commonly associated with post-traumatic stress
disorder as well as mood and anxiety disorders. Over the past 10 years of this grant, we have
accumulated several lines of evidence indicating that the dentate gyrus (DG) contributes to a
range of negative valence related behaviors including fear overgeneralization, as well as to some
of the behavioral effects of antidepressant medications. Specifically, we and others have shown
that the dentate gyrus is critical for contextual fear discrimination learning, a form a
learning that has been proposed to be mediated by pattern separation, a computational
process by which similar experiences are transformed into discrete non-overlapping neural
representations. In the current proposal we aim at bringing together these behavioral and
physiological lines of research by showing that the DG is critical for pattern separation and that
deficits in pattern separation underlie the contextual discrimination deficits often observed in mood
and anxiety disorders. Based on our preliminary results we hypothesize that strategies aimed
at improving pattern separation in the DG will be beneficial for the treatment of mood and
anxiety disorders.
Unlike most other brain regions, the adult DG contains not only mature developmentally-born
neurons but also adult-born neurons generated via a process termed adult neurogenesis. We
and others have shown that both mature granule cells (mGCs) and young adult-born granule cells
(abGCs) are critical for contextual fear discrimination learning (CFD). In the proposed studies we
will image the activity of both abGCs as well as mGCs in the DG during a contextual fear
discrimination task by using calcium imaging and miniature microscopes (miniscopes).
This imaging will be done in baseline conditions (Aim 1), after optogenetic manipulation of abGCs
to modulate DG activity (Aim 2), and after early life stress and adult manipulations of DG activity
(Aim 3).

This project is responsive to NOT-MD-19-001 Notice of Special Interest in Research on the Health of Sexual and
Gender Minority (SGM) Populations. Gender minority populations are at increased risk for cardiovascular
disease (CVD) morbidity and mortality. Specifically, Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System data suggest
that, compared to cisgender people, gender minorities are at more than double the risk for myocardial infarction
and report greater depression, physical inactivity, and elevated body mass index (BMI), as well as poorer access
to healthcare, all of which increase CVD risk. Further, many gender minority individuals take hormones, which
may further increase their risk of CVD. According to minority stress theory, the negative impact of prejudice and
discrimination is one contributor to CVD risk disparities. Although previous studies have found associations
between gender minority stress and poorer self-reported mental health, the impact of minority stress on physical
health outcomes, including CVD risk, has not been examined in gender minority populations. The goal of this
study is to advance our understanding of how minority stress and resilience affect CVD risk. In an established
longitudinal, multisite cohort of gender minority individuals in three U.S. cities (N=390), we aim to: (1)
determine the association of minority stress with mental health and CVD risk; (2) determine the impact of social
support, access to care, and identity development on mental health and CVD risk; and (3) identify modifiable
resilience factors that may influence the relationship of minority stress to mental health and CVD risk in this
health disparity population. In addition to structured interviews and Ecological Momentary Assessments (EMA)
of stress and resilience at baseline and 2-year follow-up, we will collect 2-week bursts of objective measurements
of blood pressure, sleep and physical activity. The proposed research will provide the best evidence to date to
guide researchers and clinicians working to develop interventions to reduce CVD disparities in gender minority
populations, and promote their long-term health and wellbeing.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：In this re-submitted application, we seek to evaluate maternal biomarkers of oxidative stress in relation to
schizophrenia (SZ) and autism spectrum disorders (ASD) in offspring, their relationships with one another, and
with other environmental exposures during development. The proposal is based on the Finnish Prenatal
Studies of Schizophrenia (FiPS-S), and Autism (FiPS-A), the largest seroepidemiologic studies of prenatal
exposures in these disorders to date, and the first to utilize a national birth cohort. This nested case-control
study draws on the Finnish Maternity Cohort (FMC), which consists of virtually all pregnancies in Finland from
1987-2017; the total sample size is approximately 1 million. Maternal prenatal serum samples were obtained
and archived from each gravida, and the Finnish psychiatric registries contain validated diagnoses of SZ and
ASD on virtually all hospitalized and non-hospitalized cases in Finland. We have identified large samples of
SZ and ASD case and control offspring and demonstrated relationships between several prenatal biomarkers
and these disorders in this cohort. Although maternal oxidative stress causes abnormal fetal development, is
associated with developmental insults, and leads to brain and behavioral abnormalities concordant with SZ and
ASD, no previous study has ever examined relationships between this prenatal factor and psychiatric
diagnostic outcomes in offspring. We aim to address the role of maternal exposure to oxidative stress and
these disorders by assays of maternal serum specimens in pregnancies from large samples of case and
matched control offspring. We will test the hypothesis that maternal biomarkers of the antioxidant defense
system are negatively associated with SZ and ASD in offspring and a pro-oxidant biomarker is positively
associated with these outcomes. We will also evaluate whether correlations observed between these maternal
biomarkers in control offspring are disrupted in SZ and ASD offspring. Moreover, we shall assess whether sex
and perinatal complications modify relationships between maternal oxidative stress biomarkers and SZ/ASD.
For this purpose, maternal serum samples from SZ and ASD cases and matched controls will be analyzed for
biomarkers of oxidative stress. This research has the potential to result in a better understanding of prenatal
risk factors for SZ and ASD. Since oxidative stress is a common pathogenic mechanism that is caused by
several types of environmental insults which have been implicated in these disorders, the study offers the
potential for their prevention by reducing these exposures and may suggest new pathogenic mechanisms in
future translational studies. In summary, the proposed work builds on an existing national birth cohort, and is
anticipated to impact an emerging and potentially transformative area of research epidemiology and
clinical/basic neuroscience, leading to improvements in public health policy.

Addictive psychostimulants such as amphetamine act at dopamine synapses in the striatum. Presynaptic
amphetamine action drives dopamine release via activity-dependent and activity-independent mechanisms.
Dopamine acts on multiple dopamine receptors that are differentially distributed on striatal neurons. Beyond
this volume transmission, dopamine neurons engage in synaptic transmission that is operative on a fast time
scale, compared to volume transmission, and involves not only dopamine, but also GABA and glutamate. This
project focuses on these synaptic connections as a novel substrate for psychostimulant action. The synaptic
transmission exerts excitatory effects through dopamine D1 receptors, ionotropic and metabotropic glutamate
receptors, and inhibitory effects through dopamine D2 receptors and GABAA receptors. While dopaminergic
and GABAergic synaptic connections are widespread, glutamatergic connections are concentrated in the
medial nucleus accumbens and the anterior lateral dorsal striatum. Synaptic connections to cholinergic
interneurons are the strongest, most complex, involving dopamine, GABA and glutamate. Remarkably
glutamate cotransmission is abrogated by amphetamine administration, and abrogation of glutamate
cotransmission attenuates psychostimulant responsiveness. The guiding hypothesis is that amphetamine-
induced plasticity of a subset of dopamine neuron synapses is critical for driving the striatal circuitry towards
the addicted state, particularly dopamine neuron synapses distinguished by glutamate cotransmission. The
three specific aims are to: <1> Determine quantitatively amphetamine-induced plasticity of dopamine neuron
synaptic connections to cholinergic interneurons in striatal subregions identified by synaptic connectivity-based
clustering. <2> Determine direct synaptic effects of amphetamine on dopamine neuron synaptic transmission
in striatal subregions distinguished by glutamate cotransmission. <3> Determine amphetamine effects on
dopamine neuron terminal activity during amphetamine-induced behaviors. This project will advance
understanding of the synaptic substrate of amphetamine action in the striatum, revealing loci of drug-induced
plasticity that will inform the pharmacotherapy of addiction.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：The hippocampus neurogenic niche (HNN) generates new neurons in mammals, but it is unclear if this is
happening in humans. Adult hippocampal neurogenesis is necessary to maintain intact cognitive and emotional
functions regulated by the hippocampus. Markers of immaturity have been detected in neuronal cells of the HNN
but it is still unclear if they represent adult-born neurons, or neuronal cells that have maintained their immaturity
since birth. We found that the number of neural progenitor cells (NPCs) and immature neurons was stable
throughout the eighth decade of life in normal aging (NA) subjects, but angiogenesis and neuroplasticity were
decreased in older people. Other groups have supported our findings, while some could not detect immature
neuronal cells in human hippocampus. Moreover, in aging mice, more NPCs differentiate into glia rather than
neurons, compared to younger animals, but we do not know if this happens in humans. Adult neurogenesis is
lower in Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) and it is unknown if this is because more NPCs differentiate into glia or through
other mechanisms. These gaps in knowledge warrant the use of new technologies to investigate cellular lineages
in the human HNN, and molecular regulators of NPCs proliferation, cell fate, differentiation, maturation and
survival. This project aims to identify differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) and genes (DEGs) in the human
HNN, at the regional and single cell level, comparing NA and AD. We will apply our pipeline using high resolution
mass spectrometry for proteomics analysis, and single nuclei (sn) RNA and ATAC (Assay for Transposase-
Accessible Chromatin) sequencing (seq), to identify gene expression and epigenetic changes. In slide-mounted
hippocampus tissue, we will apply Visium (10X Genomics) and our custom-made spatial transcriptomic
technology for anatomical co-mapping of cell-type specific mRNAs and proteins (DBiT-seq). Novel computational
approaches will identify neurogenesis regulators in the human HNN that can be tested in cellular or animal
models. Findings obtained with these “OMICS” approaches will be validated using HighPlex RNAscope®
(ADCBio) and immunofluorescence, and qPCR, Western blots, and ELISA assays, to visualize and quantify DEP
and DEG expression at the single cell and regional level. Our rigorous brain collection methods assure tissue
quality, uniform processing, use of toxicology and neuropathology, and strict clinical inclusion/exclusion criteria.
Groups include: NA subjects (N=100), Braak stage 0-1, age 14-99 yrs., 40 of which (60 years of age and older)
are matched (by age, sex and postmortem interval between death and brain collection) with 40 AD cases (from
the Columbia Taub Institute collection), Braak stage 1 through 4. Aims: 1. Identify HNN DEPs associated with
NA and AD. 2. Identify DEGs in immature and mature neuronal and glial cell populations of the DG in NA and
AD subjects, using sn-RNA and sn-ATAC-seq (10X Genomics). 3. Determine the anatomical localization of cell
expressing DEGs and DEPs associated with NA and AD, using Visium and DBiT-seq. 4. Test correlations
between DEPs and DEGs, and numbers of NPCs and immature neurons and glia in NA and AD.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：There are substantial inter-individual differences in biological aging trajectories, but the origin of these
differences is unclear. One specific cellular component that sustains life and fuels stress adaptation are
mitochondria, which contain their own genome and generate metabolic intermediates necessary for epigenetic
modifications. As a result, genetic defects in mitochondria shorten lifespan in both animal models and patients
with mtDNA defects, possibly via the influence of mitochondrial signaling on gene expression and the
epigenetic machinery, which includes DNA methylation (DNAm). Reliable changes in DNAm occur with
advancing age at specific genomic locations, which have been captured and integrated in predictive algorithms
called epigenetic clocks. These clocks predict DNAmAge and have been validated and meta-analyzed in large
human cohorts demonstrating that DNAmAge predicts mortality and age-related diseases. But little is known
about what clocks actually measure (i.e., what makes them tick), and about their modifiability by metabolic
factors across the lifespan. To map the life-long behavior of epigenetic clocks and their responses to both
stress mediators and mitochondrial dysfunction, we have developed a primary human fibroblasts cellular
lifespan model where: i) DNAm signatures of aging are conserved, ii) the rate of DNAm aging is accelerated
about 70 times relative to the human body, iii) metabolic and mitochondrial dysfunction reduces lifespan (i.e.,
the Hayflick limit) by 25-50%, and iv) other aging biomarkers including ccf-mtDNA and the pro-inflammatory
cytokine IL6 are also progressively induced across the cellular lifespan. In Aim 1, we will characterize DNAm
aging trajectories across the entire cellular lifespan in both female and male cells using four different global
DNAmAge algorithms, a gene-based approach, and by modeling single-CpG trajectories. There results will be
validated and extended into available human aging cohorts. In Aim 2, we will examine the modifiability of
DNAm clocks with two interventions that reliably decrease the Hayflick limit: i) we will use converging
pharmacological and genetic approaches to induce specific mitochondrial respiratory defects, and ii) expose
cells to chronic glucocorticoid stimulation to recapitulate the effects of chronic psychosocial stress known to
accelerate biological aging in humans. In the final aim, we will perform studies to understand how clock-based
DNAmAge relate to other validated aging biomarkers including the expression of age-related genes (Elovl2,
p16INK4a), telomere length, circulating cell-free mtDNA (ccf-mtDNA), and the inflammatory cytokine IL-6.
Moreover, additional experiments will be performed to establish the contribution of cell division to epigenetic
age acceleration, the role of ambient oxygen, and to test the effect of a DNA demethylation agent on other
aging biomarkers and on lifespan. Overall, these studies will uncover novel longitudinal associations between
epigenetic clocks and human aging biomarkers, and establish the role of mitochondrial signaling as a driver of
cellular aging in a human system.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Alzheimer's disease (AD), as well as normal aging, are associated with a wide range of brain
and cognitive changes. In investigating cognitive changes, it has been observed that some
people can sustain more brain changes or pathology than others, and this differential
susceptibility is related to measures such as IQ, education, vocational experiences etc. This
observation is the basis for the cognitive reserve (CR) hypothesis, where CR moderates the
effects of brain changes on cognition. Recent developments in medical imaging, particularly
multimodal neuroimaging, can provide better understanding of neural mechanisms that underlie
both cognitive changes and the role of CR. However, existing statistical methods were not
designed to accommodate large-scale multi-dimensional data, particularly for incorporating
high-dimensional moderators and mediators. To address these issues, we propose to develop,
validate, and apply software tools for the cross-sectional and longitudinal analysis of multimodal
MR brain images and cognitive data acquired from individuals with normal cognitive aging,
preclinical AD and AD from two independent studies of aging and Alzheimer's disease: the
Reference Ability Neural Networks (RANN) (Yaakov Stern, PI) and the Alzheimer's Disease
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). We will demonstrate that the developed statistical methods offer
improved accuracy and robustness over current tools. First, we will develop tools for identifying
robust relationships between neurodegeneration or pathology markers and brain function
(network expression measured by task fMRI) in the presence of CR as a moderator. Second,
we will derive neural substrate of CR using resting-state functional MRI and task fMRI and then
develop statistical tools to test the moderation effect of the imaging CR proxies. Third, we will
develop the sparse moderated mediation methods for high-dimensional predictors and
mediators accounting for moderation. to test whether network expression during cognitive tasks
mediates the effect of brain changes (measured via multimodal structural MRI) on cognitive
performance, cognitive decline and dementia transition, and whether the derived neural
substrate of CR moderates the mediation.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Intimate partner violence (IPV), a potent risk factor for depression, anxiety, and Post-traumatic Stress
Disorder (common mental disorders; CMDs), is a devastating public health problem with the highest rates
occurring in sub-Saharan Africa. Mental health interventions that aim to reduce IPV often fail to include men,
which could be addressed by treatment in a couple modality. Yet, couple-based treatments often exclude
couples who are living with IPV. The goal of this K23 Award is to expand the candidate’s skillset and prepare
her to conduct independent research on couple-based mental health interventions for CMDs that address
social determinants, such as IPV, to improve mental health outcomes and sustainability of gains. The proposed
training program involves mentorship from leading experts, coursework and workshops, attending and
presenting at scientific conferences, and developing collaborative manuscripts for publication to develop
competency in (1) engagement and mental health treatment of men; (2) adaptation of an evidence-based
treatment for CMDs to address IPV in couples; (3) methods and analyses of randomized controlled trials for
couples; and (4) skills for a successful career as an independent investigator.
 These training goals and activities will align with the aims of a research study in Mozambique, one of
the poorest countries in the world with a significant mental health treatment gap. Half of women in Mozambique
endorsed being exposed to IPV in the past year, and there are high prevalence rates of CMDs. The candidate
is Project Director of PRIDE (Partnerships in Research to Implement and Disseminate Sustainable and
Scalable EBPs, U19MH113203), a collaborative project with the Mozambique Ministry of Health that is scaling-
up comprehensive mental health care across a province using Interpersonal Counseling (IPC) to treat CMDs.
Scale-up, however, has not considered the coordinated treatment of CMDs and the co-occurring problem of
IPV among couples. The overall goal of the research plan is to investigate the feasibility of reducing CMDs in
women through a couple-based treatment that addresses CMDs and situational IPV (discord between intimate
partners that escalates to physical violence). This study has three specific aims. The first aim is to identify
gender roles including local contextual influences relevant to engaging men in couple-based treatment of IPV
in public MH care. The second aim is to adapt IPC-C to reduce CMDs in female partners through resolution of
IPV and improvement of couple functioning. The third aim is to determine acceptability and feasibility of using
Interpersonal Counseling for Couples (IPC-C) to reduce CMDs in women and IPV in couples. This study has
applicability for low-resource populations internationally and the US that experience couple-based violence and
a mental health treatment gap. With its focus on intimate partners, the intervention also has the potential to
benefit health and wellbeing of children.

Significance. Cannabis use is increasing exponentially among older US adults (≥65 years), a population that is
expected to comprise over 20% of the population in coming decades. Older adults are particularly vulnerable to
cognitive impairment associated with cannabis use, and demonstrate increasingly heterogeneous patterns of
cannabis use (including cannabis use histories and current use profiles). Consequently, this rapidly growing
population of cannabis users will become a public health concern in coming years and merit preventive and
therapeutic interventions. Extant information on cannabis use patterns and their associations with cognitive
impairment is lacking in this critically understudied population. This research proposal examines associations
between a range of cannabis use measures and cognitive impairment, particularly residual impairment (i.e.,
cognitive effects observed after acute intoxication has passed), in older adult cannabis users. Career
Development Plan. Dr. Livne’s training program will include coursework and mentorship to develop his skills
and expertise in survey design, aging and cognition-related research, and generalized linear modeling, causal
modeling and longitudinal analyses. These are necessary for achieving his career goals of becoming an
independent investigator performing impactful research on the intersection between cannabis use, cognition,
and the aging population. Mentorship. Dr. Livne’s will be supported by a highly accomplished team of mentors
who are experts in substance use epidemiology, biostatistics, aging, and cognition. Research Plan. For Aim 1,
Dr. Livne will use data from the Health and Retirement Study, a large nationally representative study of older US
adults, to examine associations between cannabis use predictors and domain-specific cognitive impairment,
including residual impairment, among adults ≥65 years. For Aim 2a, Dr. Livne will recruit a large online sample
of older adults via social media platforms, to describe cannabis use patterns (i.e., cannabis use histories, current
profiles of use) and examine the associations between such patterns. For Aim 2b, Dr. Livne will conduct a pilot
study of a subset of respondents from the online sample as well as sociodemographically comparable older
adults with no lifetime cannabis use. Using self-administered neuropsychological assessments, he will assess
the feasibility of integrating cognitive tests in online samples of older adults and provide preliminary data on
associations between detailed measures of cannabis use patterns and domain-specific residual cognitive
impairment, expanding on analyses from Aim 1. Public Health Impact. This project will illuminate patterns of
cannabis use and associated cognitive impairment among older adults, thus informing clinicians, researchers,
and policymakers of individual and public health risks in a growing yet understudied cannabis user population.
Subsequently, findings will inform the development of harm reduction strategies and the feasibility of utilizing
online research tools for cost-effective cognitive assessment of older adult substance users.

This proposed Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) will provide Hyun Kim,
PhD, a post-doctoral fellow at Columbia University, with research training and career development that will
help her become an independent and expert sleep scientist in Alzheimer's disease and related dementias
(ADRD) research. Poor or fragmented sleep increases the risk of cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's
disease (AD) through accumulation of amyloid-β, spread of tau, and accelerated microglial activation. While
sleep's connection to brain and cognitive function is widely established, it is unclear whether modifying sleep in
older adults could delay cognitive decline and slow the development of AD. Understanding the impact of sleep
treatments on cognitive changes could enhance the current understanding of sleep disturbance as a modifiable
risk factor and establish sleep interventions as a potential tool to reduce AD risks. The primary aim of the
proposed research project is to examine neurocognitive performance outcomes of cognitive behavioral therapy
for insomnia (CBTI) and acoustic slow wave activity enhancement (SWAE). The mechanism of treatment-related
neurocognitive changes will be investigated using the changes in objective and subjective sleep
parameters. The secondary aim is to examine the impact of sleep treatments on cognitively-mediated everyday
functioning. The exploratory aim is to assess whether CBTI and/or SWAE are associated with plasma AD
biomarker, namely phosphorylated tau. These research aims will be complemented by career development
plans involving (1) enhancing scientific knowledge in sleep and AD neurobiology; (2) developing skills in
clinical trial methodology and relevant analytic skills; (3) fostering professional development and networking in
sleep and AD scientific community. Collectively, the proposed study, in its research question, scope, and
structure, is designed to serve as a road map for future R01 studies that investigate the intricate relationship
between sleep and ADRD.

This K23 application presents a training and research program that will support the applicant on a path towards
becoming an NIH-funded independent investigator focused on understanding the neurobiology of the olfactory
system in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Training: The activities in this application build on the candidate’s prior
clinical neuropsychology training and research experience and are set in a resource-rich environment that will
foster his development of expertise in 1) principles of functional imaging in AD, 2) mechanisms and neural
circuitry of the olfactory system, 3) biostatistics and psychometrics, and 4) responsible conduct of research.
These training goals will be supported by a combination of didactics, formal advisory plans, and hands-on-
practicum throughout the award period. Under the guidance of his primary mentor, Dr. Davangere Devanand,
his co-mentor Dr. Terry Goldberg, scientific advisors (Drs. Gaurav Patel, Prasanna Karunanayaka, Mark
Albers, Jonas Olofsson, and Scott Small), and peer mentor (Dr. Jonathan Overdevest), the candidate will
acquire advanced skills in neuroimaging methodologies, olfactory evaluations, and AD biomarker mechanics
that will be directly applied to this proposal. Research: The overarching goal of the research to be carried out in
this application is to determine the neural mechanisms underlying odor memory deficits, and to define the
relationship between odor memory and AD biomarkers using a new process-pure variant of an odor memory
test. There is an urgent and unmet need to develop tools for enhancing early detection of AD. Olfaction and
memory are systems in which impairments develop during initial stages of AD. Odor memory, which combines
these two systems, has potential for improving upon the capabilities of existing tools which commonly measure
either system in isolation. Currently, the precise neural substrates of odor memory remain undefined. By
investigating the brain activation patterns involved in odor memory, there is promise for enhancing our ability to
identify individuals at risk for decline. This proposal will be the first to evaluate odor detection and odor memory
jointly within the same imaging paradigm. Aim 1 of the research project will examine fMRI task-related signal in
the olfactory cortex and medial temporal lobe during an fMRI odor memory procedure. Patients with AD,
patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment, and cognitively intact older adults will undergo scanning. Aim
2 strives to establish the association of abnormal odor memory with apolipoprotein genotype and plasma tau
biomarkers. In Aim 3, the clinical utility of odor memory for differentiating groups (patients with AD, patients
with mild cognitive impairment, and cognitively intact older adults) will be compared against established odor
identification and verbal memory measures.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Adolescence is a window of vulnerability for the development of schizophrenia and other mental disorders. In
schizophrenia, imaging studies have found that thalamo-prefrontal resting state connectivity is reduced during
adolescence prior to disease onset. This decrease in functional connectivity has been linked to cognitive
symptoms and the etiology of the disorder. For many years, an altered maturation of the prefrontal cortex (PFC)
has been implicated in the cognitive deficits of mental disorders yet the mechanisms that drive PFC maturation
are largely unknown. Because thalamic input activity is important for circuit maturation in sensory cortices, we
hypothesize here that thalamic input activity is also important for prefrontal circuit maturation.
To address whether adolescence is a sensitive time-period during which thalamic activity regulates the
maturation of PFC circuitry, we used mice and compared the effects of reducing activity in the thalamic nuclei
projecting to the PFC during postnatal days P20-50 with that in adulthood (P90-120). We found that inhibiting
the thalamus during adolescence leads to a long-lasting decrease in the density of thalamo-mPFC projections
and a reduced excitatory drive to mPFC neurons. Adolescent thalamic inhibition further causes cognitive deficits
in attentional set shifting during adulthood that are associated with disrupted correlated neuronal activity and
task outcome encoding in the mPFC. In contrast, thalamic inhibition during adulthood has no long-lasting
consequences on mPFC excitation, correlated activity, outcome encoding and behavior. Strikingly, exciting the
thalamus in adulthood during the set shifting task rescues in vivo neuronal activity and cognitive deficits induced
by adolescent inhibition.
While these data point to adolescence as a sensitive time window for PFC circuit maturation the underlying
mechanisms by which adolescent inhibition impairs mPFC maturation are still unclear. To address this, first, the
development of mPFC circuitry needs to be characterized during adolescence. Second, it will be important to
determine whether adolescent inhibition induces long-lasting changes in intrinsic mPFC circuitry, and which
specific mPFC projections and interneurons are regulated by adolescent thalamic inhibition. Third, it will be
important to know when such changes arise and how they relate to the changes in in vivo cross correlated activity
and outcome encoding. Our data further suggest that boosting thalamic activity could provide a strategy for
rescuing cognitive deficits in neurodevelopmental disorders. However, as presented, the beneficial effect only
occurs while the thalamus is stimulated. Therefore, strategies will need to be identified that allow for a longer
lasting rescue of the cognitive abilities. We will address these questions using three aims: Aim 1: To determine
when and where adolescent thalamic activity regulates the development of mPFC circuit connectivity. Aim 2: To
determine whether the impact of adolescent thalamic inhibition on cognition requires maturation of the mPFC.
Aim 3. To determine whether thalamic excitation can lead to a long-lasting rescue of the cognitive deficit.

neurotypical normally aging (NA) subjects from adolescence into the 90s, and 40 Alzheimer’s Disease (AD)
brains, with BRAIN Initiative-generated datasets from human brain tissue. We are implementing high resolution
mass spectrometry (HRMS) (Stephens et al., 2018; Wobma et al., 2018a; Wobma et al., 2018b), 10X Genomics
single nuclei RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq), sn Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin sequencing
(snATAC-seq), Visium spatial transcriptomics (10X Genomics), and our custom-made slide-seq technology,
using deterministic barcoding in tissue for spatial omics sequencing (DBiT-seq), for co-mapping mRNAs
and proteins (Liu et al., 2020), ATAC spatial sequencing (Deng et al., 2022) and RNA-ATAC co-profiling (Zhang
et al., 2023). We will integrate our data with publicly available datasets from GEO (Gene Expression Omnibus),
SCORCH (Single Cell Opioid Responses in the Context of HIV), PsychENCODE Consortium, NeMO
(Neuroscience Multi-Omic Data Archive), SEA-AD (Seattle Alzheimer’s Disease Brain Cell Atlas), Psych-AD
(Neuropsychiatric Symptoms in Alzheimer’s Disease) and the BICCN (BRAIN Initiative Cell Census Network).
We will include external datasets on hippocampus and other brain regions, to implement analyses on gene
regulatory networks (GRNs) that are common to neurons and glial cells across brain regions, and identify GRNs
that synergistically regulate functional brain circuits involved in cognitive, emotional, and behavioral changes in
AD. The hippocampus, fundamental for memory, the amygdala, regulating emotional responses to stress and
“fight or flight” reactions, and the prefrontal cortex (PFC), involved in set shifting, attentional control, and decision
making, are all progressively affected in AD, and they are involved in AD neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS),
such as disinhibition, impulsivity, anxiety, emotional distress, aggression, paranoid ideation, and other psychotic
symptoms. Understanding how those brain regions are regulated by cell-type specific epigenetic and gene
expression changes, will shed light on molecular mechanisms of AD pathogenesis and provide targets for new
therapeutic approaches to AD and NPS in AD. This supplement is within the scope of the active award and
improves the discovery potential of our dataset. This project will provide scalable pipelines for analyzing
multimodal and spatial omics cell profiling datasets, and will deliver a developmental and adult cell atlas of cell
type diversity. It will provide information on the regulome, the interaction between regulatory components that
control the state of expression of genes and their isoforms, their subcellular location, tissue state, development,
and pathology. These regulatory mechanisms include DNA accessibility for gene transcription, DNA methylation,
transcription factors that regulate gene transcription, RNA-protein interactions, and non-coding RNAs involved
in splicing, ribosome synthesis, degradation of mRNAs, and translation repression. The supplement will provide
broad sharing of our data via an NIH supported database and contribute to a reference atlas of human cell types.

The overarching goal of this project is to create exhibits and programs that educate broad
audiences, especially Black and Latino adolescents and young adults, about public health
careers and their role in alleviating the inequitable health outcomes that Black and Latino
communities suffer from. We will use the COVID-19 pandemic as the content focus for these
exhibits and programs. Key learning outcomes will include:
 1. COVID-19 and other health challenges have had a disproportionate impact on Black and
 Latino people, for a variety of interconnected reasons;
 2. Minimizing this disproportionate impact will require creating locally-tailored,
 culturally-responsive public health interventions and engaging community-level public
 health experts to recruit and support public participation;
 3. There are many health- and medicine-focused career pathways that young people can
 pursue that can help them contribute to the goal of better protecting vulnerable
 communities from future epidemics and pandemics.
The specific aims of this five-year proposed project are to:
 1. Project Years 1-2: Engage public health experts and community members from Queens,
 NY in a range of public events to build trust, gather input, track the latest emerging
 scientific knowledge COVID-19 and effective tracing, diagnosis and treatment; and guide
 the design and development of exhibits and workshops that address project goals.
 2. Project Year 3: Fabricate five exhibit pieces and create a career exploration workshop
 series that address these goals, pilot them at the New York Hall of Science, evaluate
 their impact and revise as needed.
 3. Project Year 4: Pilot the exhibit pieces and workshop series at a peer science center in
 Oakland, CA, evaluate their impact and revise as needed.
 4. Project year 5: Produce final versions of the exhibit pieces for the New York Hall of
 Science; disseminate exhibit plans for use at other museum sites; disseminate workshop
 formats for use at other museum sites; disseminate evaluation findings.
The project will use formative testing and prototyping to inform the design and development of
educational resources. The project evaluation will use culturally-responsive, rigorous methods to
both monitor project progress and quality and to test the impact of project deliverables on
participants and public audiences.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating progressive neurodegenerative disease in which the loss of
upper (primary motor cortex, M1) and lower (spinal cord, SC) motor neurons (MNs) ultimately leads to total
paralysis. MN loss in ALS involves cell autonomous and non-cell autonomous activities in multiple cell types of
the M1 and SC, the organization of which are well understood. However, there remain 4 major gaps in our
knowledge: 1) How ALS-associated molecular pathology in the various cell types of the M1 relates to those in
the SC; 2) How subpopulations of specific cell types are spatially arranged in these two regions; 3) How
subpopulations of different cell types are organized in higher-order ensembles; and 4) How the coordinated
behavior of these ensembles relates to disease-associated molecular pathology (e.g., pathognomonic
inclusions). Towards addressing these questions, we propose to develop a spatially resolved multi-omics
catalog of cellular subpopulations in the M1 and SC of patients with ALS and healthy controls. By using
a combination of approaches to simultaneously map the spatial transcriptome and proteome of all interacting
cellular subpopulations in these regions, our aim is to elucidate the origins and temporal dynamics of inter- and
intra-cellular activities that may reveal novel diagnostic and therapeutic targets for ALS. Our overarching
hypothesis is that ALS pathology stems from dysfunctional MN-glial interactions, and that this predictably differs
in the M1 and SC in accordance with patient symptomatology. To address this hypothesis, we propose to use
spatially resolved transcriptomic and proteomic measurements to study intact human postmortem tissue from
patients stratified by clinical presentation (i.e., site of initial symptom presentation, bulbar or lower limb). We have
previously implemented Spatial Transcriptomics on mouse and human SC to identify regional differences within
subpopulations of various cell types that vary as a function of disease dynamics. Here, we propose to build upon
our existing human study, and for the first time, develop a spatially resolved multi-omics dataset at scale and in
the context of disease in matched human postmortem M1 and SC samples (Aim 1), to enable simultaneous
exploration of upper and lower motor neurons in the context of intact tissue. These data will be directly tied to
measures of ALS pathology (e.g., pathognomonic inclusions). To integrate and analyze relationships between
data across modalities, we will develop a computational framework for harmonized analysis of multi-modal, multi-
omic measures of ALS disease burden (Aim 2). Finally, we will implement highly multiplexed immuno-imaging
to validate top gene candidates generated in Aim 1 at a single-cell level in situ (Aim 3). We expect to obtain an
unmatched view of cellular interactions in the postmortem ALS M1 and SC, and to be able to directly link such
interactions to features of ALS pathology in situ. This will allow us to identify dysregulated signaling that drives
upper and lower motor neuron loss and associated symptoms in patients in ALS.

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified thousands of common and rare genetic variants
associated with complex traits and common diseases. Most variants map to the 98% of the genome that is
noncoding, with their target genes or function largely unknown. This is the variant-to-function problem (V2F), and
solving it remains a major hurdle in human genetics research. To help solve V2F, I propose to develop modular
workflows combining GWAS variant prioritization methods and pooled single-cell CRISPR screens for target
gene identification. I have developed an integrative approach combining highly polygenic blood trait GWASs and
pooled single-cell CRISPR inhibition (CRISPRi) screens in a human erythroid progenitor cell model (K562), to
identify target genes: Systematic Targeting and Inhibition of Noncoding GWAS loci with single-cell sequencing
(STING-seq). STING-seq can functionally dissect multiple GWAS loci in a massively parallel fashion, identifying
target genes in cis as well as trans-regulatory networks. Here, I will develop STING-seq further and examine its
generalizability for other GWAS traits and their cell models. First, I will expand STING-seq with precise variant
insertion, developing base editing STING-seq (Bee-STING) for high-throughput measurements of GWAS variant
effects on target genes and regulatory networks. Second, I will develop modular workflows for GWAS variant
prioritization for STING-seq, targeting sets of variants with distinct selection criteria to increase STING-seq’s
target gene and regulatory network discovery rate. Third, I will focus STING-seq on new GWAS traits and cell
models to examine its generalizability, first piloting STING-seq for another highly polygenic complex trait, bone
mineral density, with a human osteoblast cell model (hFOB). In the long-term, these aims will help solve V2F for
human genetics research, as their continued development and application will improve our understanding of how
GWAS variants causally influence complex traits and common diseases. I have a comprehensive training plan
in place with my primary mentors, Dr. Neville Sanjana (genome engineering) and Dr. Tuuli Lappalainen (gene
regulation), my mentorship committee members, Dr. David Knowles (machine learning), Dr. Aravinda
Chakravarti (human genetics), Dr. Charles Farber (bone biology), and my collaborator Dr. Eugene Katsevich
(statistical methods). This plan will continue my training in dissecting GWAS variant function with multiple
computational and experimental approaches, along with additional training in grant writing, mentoring students,
teaching courses, and presenting at research conferences. The full mentorship committee will direct me to
pertinent literature, offer advice on my research program, and provide guidance as I navigate the academic job
market. The New York Genome Center is the ideal training location for me, given its cutting-edge facilities,
plentiful opportunities for career and intellectual development, and collaborative research environment. Upon
completion of this training program, I will be well-positioned to lead my own interdisciplinary research lab and
become a leader in the fields of human complex traits genetics and genome engineering.

A chronic inflammatory state is now considered a hallmark of sickle cell disease (SCD) resulting from ongoing
hemolytic insult to the underlying vasculature and repeated cycles of vaso-occlusion crisis (VOC). Transfusions
remain a cornerstone treatment for patients with SCD, but unlike other transfused patient populations, a higher
proportion (20-50%) of patients with SCD develop alloantibodies with potentially life-threatening sequalae. These
include poorly understood delayed transfusion reactions (DHTRs) whose occurrence, as well as clinical
progression from mild to severe, is unpredictable. A long-standing interest of our research program has been to
understand the underling immune mechanisms leading to SCD complications including VOC and transfusion
complications. Our studies have uncovered an underappreciate role of circulating monocytes and the innate
immune response to hemolysis, a hallmark of SCD, in transfusion complications including alloimmunization and
DHTRs. Our projected studies as part of this R35 will be focused on innate immune cellular pathways that
magnify the inflammatory SCD state versus the cells' heme protective pathways such as the heme detoxifying
key enzyme heme oxygenase 1 in alloimmunization and in the development of DHTRs. Our laboratory has also
identified a novel function for a subset of circulating monocytes, referred to as patrolling monocytes (PMo), in
their ability to scavenge and remove damaged endothelium and endothelial-attached sickle RBCs. The discovery
of a novel mechanism of action of PMo in SCD offers a paradigm shift in our understanding of VOC and opens
up the possibility that PMos can be manipulated to prevent painful VOC. An objective of the proposed studies in
this R35 is to understand the mechanisms by which PMo protect SCD vasculature and how they are affected
both functionally and numerically during a vaso-occlusive event with the goal to help establish their role in VOC
pathophysiology, and their potential as a therapeutic target for VOC. As we have done in the past, all the
proposed studies for both objectives will combine the use of in vivo mouse models, in vitro human model
systems, and patient samples to mechanistically dissect in a rigorous manner how specific immune cell types
and molecular pathways contribute to SCD alloimmunization and VOC. Altogether, we believe that our
laboratory's approach of integrating studies in humans and experimental models to mechanistically dissect
immune pathways that regulate SCD complications is likely to be impactful and generate novel findings in areas
critical to the NHLBI scientific mission.

 Cross-linking mass spectrometry (CLMS) is playing an increasingly important role in determining protein 3D
structures. By structural elucidation of cross-links (i.e., cross-linked peptides resulting from digestion of cross-
linked proteins or protein complexes), CLMS can determine distance constraints between specific functional
groups that can be used to guide structural modeling and docking of proteins and protein complexes. Further
quantitative analysis of cross-links would allow exploration of dynamic protein conformational changes in
solution, a challenging task for traditional structural biology techniques. However, absolute quantitative analysis
of cross-links is very challenging, due to lack of standard cross-linked peptides. To tackle this issue, we propose
to develop a novel absolute quantitative cross-linking mass spectrometry (aqCLMS) using coulometric mass
spectrometry (CMS), a method recently developed in our laboratory for absolute quantitation without using
standards. It is based on electrochemical oxidation of cross-links to produce electric current and the
measurement of the oxidation yield by MS, therefore eliminating the need of using any standards for absolute
quantitation. An aqCLMS method would enable: 1) quantitative analysis and comparison among all cross-links
at one particular or different conformational states, greatly increasing information about residue accessibilities
and their distance constraints in comparison with traditional CLMS; 2) evaluating absolute quantities of transient
protein complexes that form during a particular biological event, which is difficult to measure using existing
techniques. We foresee that our aqCLMS method is very informative in probing dynamic protein conformations,
which would have high impact in structural biology and drug discovery.
 In this project, we propose to use this aqCLMS approach to probe and quantify the conformational structures
of PROteolysis TArgeting Chimera (PROTAC)-mediated complexes, specifically BRD4-PROTAC-CRBN. A key
step in PROTAC is the formation of an induced protein complex where a degrader molecule recruits an E3 ligase
to the protein of interest (POI) to facilitate the ubiquitination of the POI, eventually leading to its proteasomal
degradation. Thus, rational design of PROTACs will require a structural understanding of target-PROTAC-E3
ternary complexes, which is, however, still very limited. In this project, in combination with advanced molecular
dynamics (MD) simulations, aqCLMS would provide deep insights into the dynamic nature of the PROTAC-
mediated ternary structure ensemble beyond what is seen in the crystal structures.

 The discovery of functional brain connectivity (FC) and functional networks (FNs) have propelled the
neuroimaging field, particularly in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), which has experienced an
exponential growth in recent years. FNs have allowed us to better understand extrinsic and intrinsic brain
properties in various disease and healthy states, leading to better characterization of neuropsychiatric
disorders. However, current fMRI analyses are constrained to the gray matter (GM) region of the brain and
fMRI data from the white matter (WM) region are often discarded, which makes up approximately 50% of the
brain by volume. Many brain disorders have been associated with WM deficiencies, since WM is critical for the
transmission of information to the GM cortical areas. Despite findings of blood-oxygen-level-dependent
(BOLD) signals in the WM, WM-FNs are yet to be fully characterized, and neither the mechanism by which
WM-FNs may affect GM-FNs, nor how WM-FNs are associated with phenotypic traits are known.
The long-term goal of this project is to better understand the effect of WM-FNs on normal cognitive
functions of the human brain and apply fMRI data from various healthy and diseased populations for more
reliable diagnostics and monitoring. The rationale for this study is based on our preliminary studies which
investigated WM-FNs using the Human Connectome Project dataset. We found that WM-FNs are correlated
with subregions of the corpus callosum, a critical WM region relaying information between the two cortical
hemispheres. Furthermore, we determined an overlap between the WM-FNs and tracts from diffusion tensor
imaging (DTI). In this study we will examine WM-FNs of the whole brain using resting fMRI data from two large
independent cohorts. We hypothesize that the FN measures derived from WM will be similar to that of GM and
the metrics can be used to reliably predict phenotypic traits. The hypothesis will be tested with the following
specific aims: Aim1: To develop and evaluate the time-series, FC and FN characteristics of WM of the whole -
brain; Aim 2: To investigate WM-phenotype associations and the predictability of phenotypes using WM-FNs;
and Aim 3: To develop and disseminate a WM-FN toolbox. To the best of our knowledge, this study will be the
first to examine the reliability and validity of WM-FNs in resting fMRI data, and its relation to brain function. The
proposed work holds significant contribution since it will facilitate the use of WM-FN methods for the
neuroimaging community, which currently lacks the necessary analytic tools to reliably characterize WM
function. This study will provide a strong foundation f or future clinical use of both WM-FNs and GM-FNs, to
understand brain function more comprehensively, in addition to facilitating the use of reliable and reproducible
WM-FC methods.

nerves, not to mention odontoblasts that interface with the dentinal tubules. Trauma or bacterial infection may
inflame the dental pulp, creating extreme pain. Extirpating the inflamed pulp (and potentially replacing it with inert
materials) ameliorates the pain, but the procedure leaves a devitalized tooth. An alternative is possible in juvenile
patients, called over-instrumentation (OI). During OI, the pulpal chamber is exposed to the peripheral circulation
post-pulpectomy. As long as the apical papilla is intact, some tissue regeneration takes place in the pulpal canal
subsequently — although the disorganized tissue does not mimic native soft tissue. In adults in particular, OI
results in non-functional pulpal ossification. Another concern in endodontic procedures is occurrence/recurrence
of colonization by oral bacteria. Such infections may prolong and exacerbate pulpal inflammation. A material-
based formulation is proposed that can (a) promote vascularized soft-tissue regeneration in the pulp, while (b)
resisting bacterial infection. Our strategy rests on self-assembling peptide hydrogels — a class of supramolecular
materials that can be injected in vivo while keeping their gel-like properties. The materials consist of canonical
amino acids and are biocompatible. Such materials need to provide both mechanical support and biological cues
for tissue ingrowth. Somewhat counter-intuitively, a self-assembling peptide hydrogel, without added growth
factors or exogenous cells, demonstrated formation of vascularized soft-tissue in a canine pulpectomy model in
28 days. In a separate study, a different cationic amphiphilic hydrogel belonging to the same platform, showed
efficacy in inhibiting bacterial growth via membrane permeabilization. In this proposal, a combinatorial treatment
modality will be tested for its effectiveness in achieving the dual goals described above. A mechanistic puzzle
that these projects would help solve is the lineage/source of infiltrating cells and evolution of the cellular milieu
in the pulpal canal after pulpectomy and implantation of soft biomimetic hydrogels. Characterization of the long-
term maturation of the vascularized soft tissue promoted by such hydrogels is another target. The multi-
disciplinary project proposed in this Bioengineering Research Grant application would bring together a chemist
and bioengineer (PI V.A.K., an early-stage investigator), a specialist in oral bacterial colonies (co-I C.C.), and an
endodontist (co-I E.S.), to solve an enduring challenge: regenerating biomimetic vascularized soft tissue post-
pulpectomy. In vitro mechanistic analyses, in vivo characterization of infiltrating cells, and histologic/radiographic
identification of long-term evolution of the pulpal soft tissue and the pulp-dentin complex would build on published
studies and extensive preliminary data. Even if the proposed experiments are only partially successful, we would
learn about tissue-material interaction in the context of dental pulp. Success of the aims would produce
compelling data for a cell-free, growth-factor-free, off-the-shelf material formulation ideal for application in
endodontic settings and improve clinical outcomes in millions of patients needing pulpectomy.

Understanding the role of the pharmaceutical industry in propelling the current opioid crisis in the U.S. is an
essential strategy for preventing future epidemics. Using multiple forms of textual data and innovative
methodologies for data mining and triangulation, this project examines the specific impacts of industry efforts to
target military veterans as opioid consumers and analyzes how new industry-driven narratives, or scripts,
about opioid analgesics were circulated. Veterans have many vulnerabilities and are one of the populations
most severely impacted by the opioid crisis and opioid-related harms, including overdose and HIV/HCV
infection. Important documents emerging in litigation against pharmaceutical companies establish that
veterans were targeted as an important consumer niche through advocacy groups and paid accounts from
veterans about the benefits of opioid therapies. However, only a small portion of the documents currently being
revealed in the process of legal discovery have been examined by public health researchers, and very little is
currently known about broader industry agendas and the processes by which pro-pharma narratives became
part of veteran-specific health discourse, driving attitudes toward opioids and raising barriers to non-opioid pain
management. To identify the themes and elucidate the processes by which these scripts were internalized by
different veteran populations, this mixed-method research will triangulate large datasets of pharmaceutical
industry marketing and legal documentation with veteran-themed publications and the lived experience of
chronic pain patients. Findings will be translated into deliverables which positively impact pain management
policy, practice, and the attitudes and expectations of veterans with chronic pain. The scientific team includes
veterans and scientists at the forefront of uncovering how the tobacco industry targeted military personnel and
veterans, along with experts on opioid use and pharmaceutical industry litigation. The systematic textual and
content analyses in this study represent a critical case study in pharmaceutical industry efforts to change
prescribing policy and popular culture and will serve as an important contribution to literature on the natural
history of drug crises and to clinical approaches to pain by achieving the following aims:
Aim 1: Use textual mining technology and analytic methods refined by tobacco researchers to explicate the
pharmaceutical industry's campaign to influence veterans' (and veterans service organizations') perceptions
opioid therapies, particularly within the context of chronic pain management.
Aim 2: Conduct qualitative interviews among veterans with histories of pain and opioid use to understand
sociocultural meanings and cognitive scripts that impede safe, effective, and medically-appropriate care.
Aim 3: Based on a synthesis of data from Aims 1 and 2, conduct T0 and T1 translational research to generate
concrete best practices, tools, and web resources to guide clinical and prescriber engagement with veteran
and other chronic pain populations.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Inter-individual variability is a common observation in studying neural systems but is often ignored in favor of
developing a general understanding of properties and responses that are the mean across individuals. This is
because we accept that neural circuits should produce stable, robust, and consistent activity, characteristic for
each behavioral context. All neural activity results from ionic currents that shape the outputs of individual
neurons or produce synaptic interactions. However, within the same neuron type, these currents and the
channels that underlie their expression show considerable variability across individuals. It remains unclear
how neurons with variable levels of ionic currents and synaptic interactions could produce consistent circuit
output activity with low inter-individual variability of output attributes. The inter-individual variability of ionic
currents is not a static problem, as neuromodulators tune those currents, thereby providing flexibility to neural
circuit activity and behavior. While neuromodulation itself can be a source of inter-individual variability,
functional circuit output should not only be similar across individuals at some basic level but should also
respond similarly to neuromodulators that shape it into different modes of operation, adaptive to different
behavioral contexts. While the role neuromodulators play in providing flexibility of circuits in individuals is well
studied, the role of neuromodulation in producing consistent functional circuit output across individuals is not.
Multiple neuromodulators act on a neural circuit at the same time. Such comodulation is understood to
enhance flexibility by increasing the number of possible circuit states. We propose that comodulation with
excitatory modulators that have convergent cellular effects promotes consistency and robustness of circuit
output. An increase in the number of circuit elements that are targeted results in more consistent overall circuit
activation, and an overall increase in excitability pushes individuals closer to shared upper boundaries of
neuron and synapse activation. We will test this hypothesis in the stomatogastric nervous system, which has
been instrumental in establishing the general organizing principles of convergent and divergent comodulation
and is an ideal testbed for understanding neural circuit dynamics. We will use electrophysiological methods to
determine the effects of single and multiple neuromodulators on individual circuit components, circuit
operation, and output activity. We will apply different sequences of increasing numbers of modulators, either
with converging or diverging cellular and synaptic actions, and determine the effects on inter-individual
variability and mean similarity of circuit output attributes. In parallel, we will use biophysical approaches,
computational modeling and mathematical analysis to understand the underlying cellular and ionic
mechanisms in circuit components that account for consistent circuit output. This work will produce a general
framework to understand the role of comodulation in the production of robust and consistent circuit output.

This application proposes partial support for the annual NBER summer institute workshops in aging and health
care from 2020 to 2024. The goal of these workshops is to provide an annual forum for researchers to present
and discuss cutting-edge scientific research on the economics of aging and health care, and to interact with other
scholars in an environment that enhances their ongoing work. A substantial portion of the studies selected and
discussed at these workshops derive from NIA-funded projects; and a substantial number of presenters and
attendees are recipients of NIA research or training grants. The substantive focus of the workshops parallels the
themes of the NIA-funded Center for Aging and Health Research at the NBER; and draws significantly from its
umbrella of ongoing work. The current themes are Health Trends and Inequalities; Data Analytics, Information
Technology and Health Care Decision-Making; The Economics of Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias;
The Dynamics of the Health Care Ecosystem; Medical Innovation and the Value of Health Care; and Behavior
Change in Health and Health Care.
NIA funding allows for a larger participant group than would otherwise be possible. The larger group made
possible with NIA support includes scholars engaged in health and aging-related research from over 50 research
universities throughout the United States, including many of the NIA-funded Centers on the demography and
economics of aging. The participant group also includes researchers from other countries, representatives of
government agencies, researchers in other academic disciplines, and newer investigators developing or
expanding their research agenda on health and aging issues.

Structural Racism and Discrimination in the Expansion of Hospital Stroke Care Capacity
 Although advances in the treatment of stroke have significantly decreased morbidity and mortality for
stroke patients in the United States, there is a growing disparity in the provision of stroke services between
disadvantaged populations and others. No studies have examined the role of structural racism and
discrimination (SRD) in the expansion of stroke care capacity across communities and subsequent effects on
health disparity patients. The long-term goal of this project is to identify system-level pathways in the delivery
of acute stroke care that contribute to the growing disparities for NIH-designated health disparity populations
(defined as racial/ethnic minority, low-income, and rural patients). The overall objective is to determine the
mechanisms through which health disparity patients experience SRD in stroke care.
 Using national data from 2009 to 2019, we propose three aims to test the following hypotheses: Aim 1,
That disadvantaged communities (defined as segregated areas with high shares of health disparity
populations) experience differential adoption of levels of stroke care, resulting in increased disparities in
potential access to care relative to other communities. Aim 2, That health disparity patients in segregated
communities experience increased disparities in actual access and treatment due to patient redistribution
across hospitals with different levels of stroke care and differential treatment within hospitals. Aim 3, That
individuals in disadvantaged communities and health disparity patients experience widening disparities in
health and functional outcomes.
 In Aim 1, we will identify which types of disadvantaged communities, if any, were left behind in gaining
stroke care access, and whether racial or ethnic segregation and income inequality contribute to these
structural disparities in geographic access. These results will aid certification bodies to consider incorporating
community need in certification guidelines. In Aim 2, our results will illuminate patient redistribution patterns in
communities that gain access to stroke care and pinpoint patients who experience disparities in actual access
and treatment depending on their race, ethnicity, and income as well as the level of segregation in each of
those dimensions. Results will identify the types of communities where outreach might be most effective in
reducing disparities in stroke care. In Aim 3, our results will determine the extent of health disparities among
stroke patients a) between disadvantaged and non-disadvantaged communities after adoption of stroke care,
compared to communities with no change; and b) between health disparity and other patients within the same
community when those communities experience changes in stroke care, relative to those in communities with
no change in access to stroke care. These findings will identify specific communities where additional
interventions (e.g., mobile stroke units, enhancing telehealth access) could yield the greatest benefits.

 Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is a disorder with recurrent, debilitating seizures as well as comorbidities
that greatly decrease quality of life. Many patients respond poorly to medications, making research important to
develop new treatments. A focus of research has been a part of the hippocampus called the dentate gyrus
(DG), and a glutamatergic cell type in the DG called the mossy cell (MC). MCs have a direct excitatory
projection to the main neuronal cell type, granule cells (GCs), so MCs are theoretically in an important position
to regulate the role of the DG in TLE. Although MCs can excite GCs, many investigators consider MC-GC
excitation is weak. Instead, MCs are thought to primarily activate DG GABAergic neurons that inhibit GCs. In
this proposal we hypothesize that both the excitatory and inhibitory actions of MCs on GCs have important
roles, particularly when an initial insult leads to TLE. Our central hypothesis is that during the initial insult,
MC excitation of GCs plays a critical role because it strengthens greatly, leading to strong excitation of
GC targets and excitotoxicity. In contrast, in chronic epilepsy, we hypothesize a very different MC role.
We suggest that MCs resume their normal role to activate DG GABAergic neurons and inhibit GCs,
which reduces chronic seizures. Therefore, during the initial insult, MCs should be inhibited for the
best outcomes and during chronic epilepsy the MCs should be activated. If supported, this hypothesis
would be a paradigm shift by changing the view of MCs in TLE. In addition, the proposed experiments will fill
major gaps in knowledge because little is known about MCs during the initial insult, latent period, and chronic
epilepsy.
 Notably, MCs regulate behavior and cognitive tasks in normal mice. We recently showed MCs regulate
tasks related to anxiety and cognition, which are comorbidities in TLE. Therefore, we hypothesize a role of
MCs in the behavioral comorbidities in TLE.
 Together these experiments will challenge prevailing views and fill several knowledge gaps about MCs, the
DG, and TLE. Furthermore, the experiments will potentially give rise to new approaches for therapeutics.

“Synthesizing, Interpreting, and Extrapolating Interventions to Foster Human Development”
will support diverse scholars of early childhood development using different empirical strategies to investigate
the sources of treatment effects of successful early childhood programs and to compare the growth of skills by
age across them. It draws on a wealth of data collected on three influential programs (the Perry Preschool
Program, the Abecedarian Project, and Jamaica Reach Up and Learn) and subsequent implementations and
adaptations. Members of our team have actively designed, collected, and analyzed different subsets of these
programs evaluated by random assignment. Some programs have long-term follow-ups. This research has five
main aims: (1) Using common (across studies) dynamic analytical frameworks developed and applied in
different disciplines, we analyze longitudinal data on the growth of comparable measures of skills and
outcomes from major early childhood interventions targeted to disadvantaged children, controlling for family
and environmental conditions. We conduct mediation and moderation analyses to control for endogeneity of
intervention-induced changes in mediators and moderators. We examine the intra- and inter-generational
impacts of the interventions with long term follow up, taking participants well into their middle age (ABC) and
late middle age (Perry). These analyses adjust for attrition and non-response. We use both large sample
inferential methods and design-based small-sample randomization inference. We harmonize measures and
outcomes and require those we use to satisfy metric invariance criteria; (2) Building on our previous research,
we use empirically validated dynamic models to forecast experimental outcomes out-of-sample. We build
theoretically- and empirically-grounded tools to estimate the long-run impacts of short-run interventions that
will be available to other practitioners; (3) Update and extend cost-benefit analyses of early childhood
programs. For the first time, we incorporate impacts on adult children and siblings as well as impacts on
middle age and late middle age health and earnings of the original participants. We investigate the impact of
early childhood programs on social mobility; (4) Examine the effectiveness of home visiting programs. We
analyze the influential Jamaica Reach Up and Learn home visiting program and many programs inspired by
it. We compare child growth trajectories from these programs with those from more comprehensive omnibus
(and expensive) early childhood programs, many of which have a home visiting component. This will facilitate
isolation of the role of home visiting in promoting child development; and (5) We investigate in detail the roles
of parent (caregiver)-child, home visitor-child, and home visitor-caregiver interactions in promoting skill
development in a uniquely well-documented adaptation of Jamaica Reach Up: China REACH (10 sites). We
quantitatively assess the impact of “scaffolding” measured on a weekly basis on the growth of child skills.

Clean drinking water is crucial to human health and longevity. Despite enormous improvements in water
treatment over the early 20th century, drinking water pollution remains a critical threat to US public health,
particularly for older people and individuals with chronic conditions. In an effort to protect public health, federal
regulations set drinking water quality standards and regulate the public water purification systems and pipes that
carry treated water to households for human consumption. An estimated $473 billion in current national
construction funding is needed to achieve compliance with drinking water standards, even as much remains
unknown about how polluted drinking water affects health, especially among older Americans. Policy debates
about drinking water regulations highlight the need for an improved understanding of the benefits and costs of
drinking water regulations, including determining whether drinking water investments should be increased and
ensuring that safe drinking water remains accessible and affordable to vulnerable communities. This project
seeks to add substantially to the existing stock of knowledge about the health effects of drinking water pollution
by studying the effects of large federal loans intended to upgrade drinking water treatment plants that service
residential communities. By harnessing quasi-experimental variation in loan receipt, the project will examine how
these loans affect drinking water pollution and how they shape short- and long-run mortality and disease burdens
among older Americans. Because some loans target specific pollutants, like arsenic or pathogens, the analysis
will examine the extent to which these loans specifically affect the pollutants they target and the health conditions
associated with those pollutants. To enable this research, the project will compile the most complete set of
records on drinking water systems linked to pollution measures based on Freedom of Information Act requests
made to each of the 50 states. These data will be posted online to catalyze broader research on drinking water
pollution and health. This project will combine these drinking water records with the most comprehensive
individual-level health dataset—Medicare administrative data for 100% of beneficiaries—allowing for rigor,
accuracy, and generalizability of findings. Beneficiary identifiers will allow us to follow individuals over time
regardless of whether and where they relocate, with minimal attrition. The Medicare data provide the 9-digit zip
code of residence, allowing the analysis to pinpoint the location of individuals more precisely than prior research.
In addition, the analysis will examine the extent to which low-income communities and communities of color
benefit equally from drinking water improvement policies, both in spending and health terms, and it will
summarize the distribution of drinking water quality by household race, income, and other important
demographics.

THE IMPACTS OF ENHANCED DRUG-PATENT EXAMINATION
The legal patentability requirements are designed to respect the balance between patient access to existing
longevity-improving drugs and incentivizing their existence in the first place. However, the patent system may
fail to achieve this balance if it does not provide patent examiners with the resources—mainly, time—needed to
apply these patentability standards. Given the legal presumption of validity of incoming patent applications,
insufficient examination time may lead to concerns that the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) will issue
patents on non-novel or obvious innovations, a result which may unnecessarily inhibit patient access and
thereby compromise patient outcomes. Patent quality concerns of this nature have been particularly
paramount in the case of “secondary” patents—i.e., patents on subsidiary drug features such as on routes of
administration. Given that secondary patent applications are often filed years after the issuance of the active-
ingredient patent, they have the potential to meaningfully extend the effective patent lives of given drug
products, potentially limiting access on the margin to clinically valuable drugs. In this project, we propose to
investigate the full extent to which secondary patenting practices may be extending effective patent lives of
FDA-approved drugs. Further, drawing on certain PTO reforms and features, we will investigate the impacts of
increasing examination time on drug-patent examination quality. In particular, we will address four aims:
  Compiling, reviewing and coding data from both the PTO and the FDA, we will build a database of
 small-molecule drug patents associated with FDA-approved drug products from the mid-1980s to the
 present, containing various information associated with each such patent, including information (if any)
 on claims associated with secondary drug features.
  We will similarly build a database of large-molecule drug patents, though this effort will likely require a
 deeper and more extensive review of raw PTO materials given the lack of a congressionally mandated
 list of biologics-related patents associated with FDA-approvals.
  Using these data and employing various quasi-experimental approaches, we will estimate the
 relationship between the examination time allotted to examiners and the likelihood that the patents they
 issue meet the legal patentability requirements.
  Drawing on the results from Aim #3, we will run simulation exercises to assess the degree to which an
 increase in examination time will shorten the effective patent lives of approved FDA drug products and
 thereafter draw on various estimated moments from the generic-entry literature to estimate the resulting
 effects on increased/accelerated patient access to approved medications.

Nanopath proposes to develop a point-of-care molecular diagnostic that can identify UTI-causing
pathogens and key genetic markers of antibiotic resistance directly from a patient urine sample in
15 minutes, without the need for nucleic acid amplification. Despite the severity and prevalence
of UTIs, the current diagnostic standard-of-care relies on culture-based methods, which take an
average several days to return species-level and antimicrobial resistance information. This time-
intensive diagnostic workflow leaves many patients in pain and/or at-risk of severe infection before
they are prescribed targeted antibiotic therapy. Critically, empiric treatment of UTIs is one of the
largest contributors to the growing problem of antibiotic resistance. Nanopath’s product is a single-
use assay cartridge coupled to a low-cost readout instrument. The assay cartridge integrates
sample preparation with our proprietary molecular nanosensor. Our multiplexed molecular
nanosensor is functionalized with an array of probes complementary to 1) species-specific genetic
sequences and 2) genetic markers of antimicrobial resistance. In our preliminary work, we
designed a 5-target proof-of-concept panel encompassing three bacterial species and two
antimicrobial resistance genes that are commonly observed in UTIs. Our preliminary data
demonstrate highly selective and robust target detection in a variety of sample matrices, including
healthy patient urine. Our Phase II effort will focus on four Specific Aims. First, we will expand our
target panel to encompass >95% of UTI-causing organisms and key markers of antimicrobial
resistance. This will involve rational design and bench-top validation of candidate PNA probes to
inform a finalized panel and probe set. Second, we will optimize the design of the assay cartridge
to integrate sample handling functions, lower limit-of-detection, and enable high throughput
sample processing. This aim will also support low-volume manufacturing of the assay cartridge in
preparation for verification studies. Third, we will perform a series of comprehensive analytical
verification studies on the assay. Finally, we will characterize clinical performance of Nanopath’s
UTI assay in pilot clinical study (n>200) in collaboration with Brigham & Women’s Hospital.
Successful commercialization of this technology will enable point-of-care characterization of UTIs
in <15 minutes, enabling the immediate targeting of antibiotic therapy and alleviating ongoing
contributions to antibiotic resistance. The applications of the proposed platform extend beyond
UTIs and are translatable to other clinical scenarios that currently employ lengthy culture-based
steps and molecular testing workflows, such as respiratory infections, bloodstream infections, and
prosthetic joint infections.

Mutations in the genome of somatic cells in multicellular organisms result from DNA repair or replication errors,
causing cancer and other age-related diseases. As DNA mutations are irreversible, they represent the critical
molecular endpoint of the interaction between DNA damage and genome integrity maintenance mechanisms.
Thus, quantifying diverse mutation types in cells and tissues is essential in genetic toxicology for assessing
genetic risk associated with human exposure to environmental and anthropogenic agents. Current techniques
face challenges due to low mutation abundance and indistinguishability from sequencing errors. We propose
optimizing and validating Single Molecule Mutation Sequencing (SMM-seq), a novel approach for accurate,
cost-effective assessment of somatic mutations in normal cells and tissues. SMM-seq detects single-nucleotide
variants, small insertions and deletions, and structural variants, providing a comprehensive tool for somatic
mutational burden assessment. Our research has two specific aims: 1) optimize and validate an integrated
SMM-seq assay for measuring the mutational landscape of normal cells, focusing on protocol consolidation,
automation, and precision and recall evaluation; and 2) assess the mutagenicity of known genotoxic agents on
human primary cells. In this Phase 1, we will establish the technical merit and feasibility of SMM-seq and
develop a prototype platform, and scale up and expand applications in subsequent phases. The resulting
diagnostic product will address a market gap by providing a practical analytical tool for integrated genetic
toxicity/mutagenicity testing and monitoring human exposure to mutagenic agents, supporting the launch of a
successful business venture.

 The state of the mother's immune system during pregnancy plays an important role in fetal
development, and disruptions in this immune balance are associated with a range of neuropsychiatric
and neurodevelopmental disorders. Epidemiological and clinical studies have revealed associations
between neurodevelopmental disorders including Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and Attention Deﬁcit
Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and family history of immune system dysfunction, most notably allergies
and asthma. Over the past three decades, analogous increases have been reported in both the
incidence of ASD, ADHD, and immune-related disorders, particularly immune hypersensitivities that
include allergies and asthma. Several case-control reports have noted that mothers with elevated
allergic-associated cytokines during pregnancy are at greater risk of having a child who was later
diagnosed with ASD or ADHD. These data raise the hypothesis that maternal allergic asthma (MAA)
produces neurobehavioral deﬁcits in offspring and highlight a yet undetermined link between the
maternal immune system and risk of neurodevelopmental disorders. Using a validated mouse model of
allergic asthma, we have demonstrated that offspring of MAA dams exhibit behavioral deﬁcits
characterized by decreased social interactions and increased repetitive behaviors. This proposal will
extend these ﬁndings by exploring the mechanistic contribution of the allergic asthma-associated
cytokine interleukin-4 (IL-4) in driving the link between MAA on offspring brain and behavior
development. Speciﬁcally we will [1] determine the contribution of maternal IL-4 signaling in
precipitating neurodevelomental deﬁcits, [2] characterize the safety and efﬁcacy of the allergic asthma
medication dupilumab, an IL-4 receptor antagonist, in preventing the effects of MAA on offspring
behavior, [3] examine the neuroimmunological consequences of MAA on offspring brain development,
and [4] associate changes in neuroimmune signaling with behavioral outcomes. The results of these
experiments will determine the extent to which maternal IL-4 signaling in allergic asthma contributes to
offspring neurodevelopmental deﬁcits and inform future therapeutic interventions for mitigating the
effects of maternal asthma in at-risk populations.

This project aims to optimize a critical but understudied ingredient of language intervention provided to children
with developmental language disorder (DLD) – feedback. The project is designed to bridge the gap between
previous findings in our lab of inefficient feedback processing in DLD and clinical practice by identifying the
conditions under which feedback-based learning can be improved in DLD. We hypothesize that the
effectiveness of feedback can be significantly enhanced for children with DLD when it is tailored to their unique
learning strengths. The rationale for this project is based on evidence that learning can be improved by
enhancing the dominance of an intact learning system through feedback. The project will achieve its aim by
manipulating (1) the timing of the feedback (immediate vs. delayed) and (2) the level of the learner’s
involvement in error correction dictated by feedback (active vs. passive correction) to modulate the dominance
of the implicit and declarative learning systems. While immediate feedback is processed by the implicit learning
system, delaying the feedback by a few seconds implicates the declarative system. Likewise, teaching
approaches that prompt active self-correction are associated with declarative learning, while passive exposure
to corrective feedback (e.g., corrective recast) is assumed to support implicit learning. Aim 1 will determine
the effect of manipulating feedback timing on declarative and implicit learning in 140 school-age children (8-12
years) with DLD. Evidence that delaying feedback improves learning in DLD would support the hypothesis of
the implicit deficit theory that intervention should capitalize on declarative learning mechanisms. The project
will test a novel alternative feedback-learning parity hypothesis whereby feedback-based learning is optimized
when the timing of the feedback is aligned with the dominant learning system at a given time (i.e., immediate
feedback during implicit learning; delayed feedback during declarative learning). Within the same group of
children, Aim 2 will compare feedback-based learning in children with DLD when feedback (a) prompts active
self-correction or (b) passively exposes learners to error corrections. Children will engage in two nonword-
object paired-associate learning tasks. In one task feedback will promote active self-correction, which is in line
with declarative learning. In the other task, feedback will passively expose the learner to corrective feedback
and lead to learning that is assumed to be implicit. The project will determine whether children with DLD learn
better when feedback prompts self-correction or when they are exposed to passive corrections. For both aims,
behavioral indicators of response to feedback will be complemented by electrophysiological measures of
feedback processing that can determine the involvement of implicit and declarative brain systems during the
learning process. This work is scientifically and clinically significant because elucidating what manipulations
optimize feedback-based learning will enhance our understanding of the impaired learning mechanism in DLD
and will provide clinical guidance on what type of feedback to use during an intervention.

The long-term goal of this research is to translate years of federally-funded basic science on comprehension
processes and interventions to provide elementary-age children with strong, school-based language stimulation
to improve reading comprehension. The short-term goal of this proposal is to stimulate language and
comprehension skills in Grade 1 children at risk for reading comprehension failure by testing the efficacy of a
modified, small-group, version of the Let's Know! intervention, which has shown to be efficacious as a whole-
class curriculum. Let's Know! systematically targets lower- and higher-level language skills to improve both
language skills and listening comprehension. Delivering small-group instruction affords a targeted focus on
those children with low language abilities who are most at risk for poor reading comprehension, many of whom
have Developmental Language Disorder (DLD). To accomplish our goal, we have three specific aims: (a)
determine the efficacy of Let's Know! as a school-based, small-group, language-focused comprehension
intervention for promoting the lower-and higher-level language skills of Grade 1 children who are at risk for
comprehension difficulties due to low language, (b) determine the efficacy of Let's Know! for promoting the
comprehension skills of children who are at risk for comprehension difficulties due to low language, and (c)
determine the extent to which intervention effects are moderated by dosage, initial language skill, DLD status,
word reading skill, nonverbal IQ, and family socioeconomic status. The proposed project involves a
collaborative and multi-disciplinary partnership among researchers who study basic developmental processes
pertaining to language and reading acquisition as well as school-based prevention and intervention to support
language and reading skills. We use a three-phase approach to accomplish this clinical trial. Phase 1
encompasses key research activities to ready the intervention for implementation in Phase 2's randomized
controlled trial (RCT). Phase 2 comprises a multisite RCT to determine the efficacy of Let's Know! as a small-
group, language-focused comprehension intervention when implemented at children's respective schools. The
RCT will meet guidelines for high-quality efficacy trials in education and prevention science. Phase 3 will
comprise analyses of impacts on children's language and comprehension skills, in both the short- and long-
term, from Grade 1 through Grade 3 as well as moderation of effects. This proposal is innovative in three
primary ways. First, the proposal focuses on prevention of reading comprehension failure, in children most
vulnerable to failure, in a crucially important area of reading instruction that is weak or missing in most US
schools – explicit and systematic teaching of language and comprehension skills. Second, the study builds on
decades of basic research on comprehension processes and evidence-based pedagogical practices to translate
these into a practical intervention that fits squarely within the US educational system. Considering that
evidence-based practices are rarely implemented due to research-to-practice gaps, building the intervention to
fit in the current educational system increases its chance of implementation, if found to be efficacious. Third,
the proposal considers longitudinal impacts of the intervention and moderators of the effect, which has both
clinical and theoretical implications for comprehension processes and interventions.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Although one in four children with autism remain minimally verbal past age five, we do not know all
the factors that limit spoken language in these minimally verbal children with autism. One powerful
contributor may be a concomitant motor speech disorder, Childhood Apraxia of Speech (CAS). CAS
is an impairment in the ability to plan and sequence for speech, which renders speech inconsistent
and imprecise. But because producing intelligible speech is a prerequisite to acquiring spoken
language, there is an urgent need to understand how CAS may affect speech movements and
intelligibility in minimally verbal children with autism, and to develop interventions that incorporate
strategies to address CAS, when present. This project proposes three studies to investigate the
relationship between CAS and speech in minimally verbal children with autism and CAS. First, we
compare a group of 11 minimally verbal children with autism who meet criteria for CAS to a group of
11 who do not meet criteria for CAS. We hypothesize that facial movement tracking, a non-invasive
method to investigate speech motor function, will reveal that the +CAS group show lower movement
consistency and precision than the –CAS group. Next, we investigate the relationship of clinical signs
of CAS to speech movement parameters and to intelligibility. We hypothesize that more severe CAS
predicts lower movement consistency and precision, and lower intelligibility, in an additional group of
22 minimally verbal children with autism+CAS. Finally, we use the previous investigations to inform
treatment for a group of 20 minimally verbal children with autism+CAS. First we identify the speech
movements for each child that are both disordered and degrade intelligibility,. Then, we create a set
of mono- and bisyllabic stimuli involving these movements and train participants on a subset of them
in a series of single-subject experiments. Treatment will involve principles of motor learning (massed
and distributed practice) and dynamic cueing, which have been shown to be effective for treating
CAS. Both perceptual (intelligibility-based) and objective (movement-based) outcome measures will
demonstrate the extent to which this targeted treatment improves speech production in these
children. The findings will inform clinical practice for minimally verbal children with autism and lead to
the development of novel interventions for this severely affected population.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
Improving children’s diets and physical activity levels are key strategies to reduce the risk of obesity. However,
most children do not meet dietary or physical activity recommendations, and children who are from families
with socioeconomic disadvantages and/or who are racial/ethnic minorities experience disproportionately higher
rates of obesity, with Alaska Native/American Indian children experiencing the highest rates nationally. Schools
can be an ideal location to promote healthier habits as children spend a substantial portion of their time in
school and often consume up to half their daily energy intake there. Two promising, cost-effective school
policies are longer lunch periods and longer recess with integrated PA opportunities, but rigorous evidence is
lacking. In this time-sensitive proposal, we propose to evaluate a natural experiment in Anchorage, Alaska of
the implementation of a wellness initiative in elementary schools that includes 30 minute lunch periods and 54
minutes of PA daily (including 30 minutes of recess in addition to classroom movement activities). The
wellness initiative will have a staggered rollout in schools over the span of four years. Our study will collect
longitudinal data from 4,000 students in K-4th grade to assess changes in school meal consumption using plate
waste methodology (Aim 1). Physical activity levels will also be assessed in a subsample of children (n=2,000
students in grades K-4) using accelerometer measurements (Aim 2). Outcomes will be measured at baseline
and post-implementation the following school year (collected during the same month at each time point).
Additionally, BMI, sleep duration and quality, and other factors related to academic performance (i.e., changes
in students’ disruptive classroom behaviors [measured at baseline and one year post-implementation],
disciplinary referrals to the principal, hunger-related visits to the school nurse, and standardized test scores
[baseline and up to four years post-implementation]) will be evaluated. Implementation fidelity will be assessed
throughout the study period via site visits, environmental scans, and teacher surveys. Anchorage School
District plans the staggered implementation of the initiative to begin in the 2021-22 school year. Thus, time-
sensitive funding is critical to ensure adequate time for baseline data collection. The proposal’s significance
lies in our ability to provide the first empirical evidence of the degree to which school policies for longer lunch
periods and integrated physical activity opportunities influence students’ dietary intakes, physical activity levels,
weight status, and factors related to academic performance. This rigorous, innovative, and time-sensitive study
will contribute to the development of a comprehensive evidence base on the potential effectiveness of school
nutrition and physical activity policies, which can help to address health disparities in children, including among
an underserved and understudied Alaska Native population. Study results will also provide essential evidence
to inform local, state, and federal policymakers’ decisions regarding school nutrition and physical activity
policies as well as have the strong potential to impact children’s health more broadly.

This application will provide the Principal Investigator, Dr. Teresa Kimberley, with protected time and
support to (1) accelerate a successful record of mentoring junior investigators; (2) provide research
training to mentees engaged in patient-oriented communication disorder research; (3) enhance
training in assessing voice production and; (4) advance the translation of Dr. Kimberley's ongoing
research on laryngeal dystonia. Dystonia is a group of devastating neurological movement disorders
that can affect any body region. There is no cure or disease-modifying treatment and the
pathophysiology of the disorder remains largely unknown. The most common dystonia affecting the
vocal fold muscles is adductor laryngeal dystonia (AdLD). People with AdLD suffer from a strangled
voice and speech interruption due to involuntary spasms of the thyroarytenoid (TA) muscles. The long-
term goal of this award is to elucidate the pathophysiology of laryngeal dystonia and to develop
sensitive testing and novel interventions to treat the disease. The proposed project builds upon Dr.
Kimberley's cutting-edge work of developing a novel and valid transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)
methodology to assess the cortical excitability of the laryngeal motor cortical area. Recent findings have
shown an atypical pattern of brain activation and decreased intracortical inhibition in people with
AdLD. The hypothesis is that a 5-day inhibitory rTMS protocol targeted to the left laryngeal motor
area associated with the TA muscles will increase intracortical inhibition and improve phonatory
function in people with AdLD. Individuals with AdLD will participate in a randomized, double-blinded,
sham-controlled, preliminary trial. The primary tests will include assessments of phonatory function
(Aim 1) and TMS-measured neurophysiology (Aim 2). Factors associated with positive response to the
intervention will also be explored (Aim 3). This project offers a unique opportunity for mentees to train
in clinical and translational research that is at the intersection of corticobulbar neurophysiology, non-
invasive neuromodulation, and clinical assessment of voice disorders. The rich resources at
Massachusetts General Hospital, MGH Institute of Health Professions, and Spaulding Rehabilitation
Hospital provide an outstanding scientific environment to train the next generation of researchers in
an interdisciplinary approach to communication disorders research. This project has the potential to
positively impact people with AdLD by expanding treatment options, improving quality of life and
reducing healthcare burden for people with this disorder. The knowledge gained from the proposed
study will extend to future research to optimize neuromodulatory interventions, explore rTMS as an
adjunct therapy to current treatments, and to determine if rTMS can be translated to other voice
disorders or types of focal dystonia.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
Herpes simplex viruses 1 and 2 (HSV-1, -2) are epidemic worldwide. Globally, it has been estimated that
approximately 1.5 million cases of HSV-related ocular infection occur every year, with 40,000 of those ending
up with longstanding visual damage. The virus’s ability to spread through airborne droplets contributes to its
high degree of transmissibility, often leading to blinding corneal ulcers. Current standards of care include
concurrent treatment with anti-virals and corticosteroids, which are effective, but have side effects that can
compromise visual acuity. Similarly, during severe inflammatory conditions, corneal transplantation is required
to preserve vision. Therefore, there is a need to develop therapies that can prevent or reduce the ability of
HSV-1 to infect ocular surface epithelial cells, which would then mitigate subsequent inflammation and loss of
visual acuity. It has been suggested that molecules contributing to more than one step in the HSV life cycle
may serve more effectively as targets for new preventative or therapeutic drugs. Dynasore is a cell-permeant
small molecule developed to target the GTPase activities of classic dynamins, a family of molecules that
participate in several endocytic pathways and in several steps in the HSV life cycle. Indeed, dynasore has
been demonstrated to have pleiotropic effects against HSV infection, including inhibition of cell uptake,
intracellular trafficking, capsid assembly, and cell-to-cell spread. The applicant company recently undertook a
project to develop dynasore analogues to protect against epitheliopathy in dry eye (DE) disease. The team
identified 3 lead compounds that inhibit clathrin-mediated endocytosis with greater potency than dynasore.
Two of the leads are novel chemical entities (NCEs) substantially different from dynasore, thus are likely to be
patentable. Importantly, the team now demonstrates their antiviral effect specifically against HSV infection of
corneal mucosal epithelial cells in culture, although with different rank potencies than for cytoprotection. The
goal of this proposal is to refine the structure-activity relationship for antiviral effect against HSV. From this
screen, up to 5 lead compounds with optimized anti-HSV1 profiles will be selected. Then, using a mouse
model of HSK, the most efficacious compound(s) will be identified to take forward for further development.
Following completion of this Phase I effort, the team will have defined the SAR for inhibition of HSV-1 infection
and HSK in a mouse model. During Phase II, the team will prepare additional compounds to evaluate
absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) properties as well as physicochemical and
pharmacokinetic (PK) measurements. Finally, the team will fine tune the formulation and dosage to maximize
efficacy, shelf life and ease of application, while decreasing any toxic or off-target effects.

This is a revised application, modified to fully respond to reviewers’ comments and FDA interactions since the
application (FDA pre-IND meeting held on Sept. 25, 2018). The proposed work will complete IND-enabling
studies to progress cell replacement paradigms into the clinic using induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-
derived dopamine (DA) neurons, and a first-in-man clinical trial for autologous transplantation in Parkinson’s
disease (PD). Cell replacement therapy with midbrain dopamine (mDA) neurons provides cellular and synaptic
repair in the parkinsonian brain, and addresses both the motor symptoms of PD as well as levodopa-induced
dyskinesias. Our previous fetal cell transplantation work shows that in PD patients transplanted mDA neurons
remain healthy and can provide remarkable therapeutic benefit for decades. While fetal cell transplantations
are not scalable for a larger patient population and require immunosuppression, iPSCs are a promising
alternative cell source. iPSCs generated from PD patients can be differentiated into midbrain dopaminergic
cells, frozen and used for autologous transplantation.
The NINDS CREATE Bio Development Track U01 proposal over 5 years consists of milestones within four
Specific Aims, that includes a Phase I clinical trial in human patients with PD. In Specific Aim 1 we will transfer
the remaining mDA neuron product quality control assays for qualification in the cGMP facility, perform FDA-
guided quality control of excipients for the clinical product, and produce mDA neurons to be used in IND-
enabling studies. In Specific Aim 2, definitive IND-enabling studies will be performed to test the safety
(tumorigenicity and biodistribution) and efficacy of human iPSC-derived frozen-thawed mDA neurons in
rodents, as well as testing of the planned clinical delivery device in non-human primates. Specific Aim 3 will
include IND package preparation and filing for an Investigator-initiated Phase I clinical trial, recruitment of
patients with PD and generation of autologous cGMP iPSCs and mDA neurons as well as release criteria
testing of the cryopreserved clinical product. Finally, Specific Aim 4 is a first-in-human clinical Phase I
interventional, open-label clinical trial in 6 patients with sporadic PD, to test the safety and efficacy of
autologous transplantation of frozen-thawed mDA neurons.
This highly innovative autologous CMC iPS cell technology U01 proposal for cell replacement clinical trials in
PD patients provides a necessary step and exploration for the development of successful cell therapy for PD
and several neurological disorders.

Low back pain (LBP) is one of the most common reasons for physician visits in the USA. A substantial number
of chronic LBP (cLBP) patients do not adequately respond to current treatment options. Thus, the development
of new treatments for cLBP is urgently needed.
The use of imagery to treat illness, including chronic pain, is one of the oldest medical practices. Although still
under investigation, literature suggests that the brain responds to imagined experience similarly to the way it
responds to actual experience. Acupuncture is an ancient invasive therapeutic method and has been
recommended for treating cLBP by the American College of Physicians. Previous studies have shown that
both the experience of acupuncture needle stimulation and the visualization of acupuncture needle stimulation
can provoke overlapping brain activation, which suggests that visualizing or imagining acupuncture may
achieve therapeutic effects through a brain pathway similar to actual acupuncture treatment.
Combining acupuncture and imagery, the PI (co-founder of Massachusetts Neuro Technology (MNT) and a
research investigator at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH)) and his team developed a new treatment
modality, 2-dimensional (2D) video-guided acupuncture imagery treatment (2D-VGAIT). We found that 2D-
VGAIT can 1) produce an analgesic effect in healthy subjects and 2) produce comparable symptom relief to
real acupuncture after a 1-month (6 treatments) intervention in cLBP patients. Nevertheless, 2D-video is limited
in its ability to simulate real experience. Recently, Virtual Reality (VR) has drawn the attention of researchers.
Studies have shown that VR is a powerful tool for studying body representation and creating perceptual body-
ownership transfer illusions. These unique properties of VR will advance 2D-VGAIT to the next level.
Thus, the aim of this Phase I R41 (STTR) application is to develop a novel mind-body treatment modality /
system (VR-guided acupuncture imagery treatment (VRGAIT)) that leverages the power of VR, imagery, and
acupuncture to enhance the experiential simulation of video-guided acupuncture imagery and reduce chronic
low back pain. Specifically, we will first develop a functional VRGAIT system / platform (prototype) (Aim 1).
Next, we will perform a feasibility study that treats cLBP with the VRGAIT system (Aim 2). This application, if
successful, will provide a cost-effective and easily accessible treatment option for cLBP and other chronic pain
disorders, particularly for those who may have limited access to acupuncture treatment and medical care.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) remains a major public health problem with poorly understood 
etiology and pathophysiology. Impairment in reward processing and anhedonia are core features of 
MDD. Findings during the prior award period have shown that MDD and anhedonic phenotypes are 
characterized by functional, structural and molecular abnormalities within a CorticoStriatal 
Valuation Circuit critically implicated in value encoding and reinforcement learning. The main goal 
of the this R37 renewal is to expand this line of work in several fundamental new directions to (1) 
attain a better mechanistic understanding of MDD and anhedonia by focusing on a novel target - 
Nociceptin/Orphanin FQ Receptors - expected to yield molecular abnormalities associated with 
CorticoStriatal Valuation Circuit and stress- induced inflammatory abnormalities (Aims 1 and 2); 
and (2) identify abnormalities that map disease course (Aim 3). This will be achieved through an 
innovative integration of (1) molecular imaging techniques with a novel positron emission 
tomography (PET) NOP tracer ([11C]NOP1A) in unmedicated individuals with current or past MDD, (2) 
state-of-the-art analyses of stress-related pro-inflammatory transcription control pathways, (3) 
behavioral and functional neuroimaging markers of key depressive phenotypes, and (4) a naturalistic 
follow-up design. To differentiate between state- and trait-like markers of vulnerability, 
currently depressed individuals (MDD), remitted individuals with a history of MDD (rMDD), and 
never-depressed healthy controls will be included. Based on findings from the prior project period, 
we hypothesize that, relative to healthy controls, MDD and rMDD participants will show 
significantly higher [11C]NOP1A binding potential in brain regions critically implicated in stress 
regulation and reward processing (Hypotheses 1).
Moreover, among individuals with current or past MDD, N/OFQ abnormalities in brain regions 
implicated in stress regulation and reward processing will be associated with (1) behavioral and 
neural markers of anhedonic phenotypes; (2) lower ability to regulate stress responses; and (3) 
higher stress-related proinflammatory cytokines and transcription control pathways (Hypotheses 2). 
Finally, we expect that N/OFQ abnormalities (and associated behavioral, fMRI, hormonal, and 
inflammatory markers) will predict anhedonic symptoms and poorer general functioning at follow-up 
(Hypothesis 3). Collectively, the proposed research promises to improve our mechanistic 
understanding of stress-induced anhedonia and the pathophysiology of MDD, as well as our ability to 
identify mechanisms that prospectively predict reward deficit-related symptoms, thus opening novel 
avenues for improved treatment and prevention.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：The main objective in the field of psychiatry is to be able to treat patients at an individual level. To reach this goal
of precision medicine, large scale initiatives such as the RDoC have been developed to find new ways to parse
heterogeneity in psychiatric disorders. Their success has been slow partly due to a slow transition away from
case-control studies based on diagnoses and limitations due to small sample size. Therefore, there is a critical
need to find alternative solutions at an affordable cost. One strategy is to identify a complex behavior such as
Reinforcement Learning based decision making (RLDM) that is impaired across various psychiatric disorders
and adopt a computational framework to explain heterogeneity at an individual level. RLDM is a multifaceted
construct involving several sub-processes ranging from estimating values of different options in the environment
(valuation), accumulating evidence for these options (sequential sampling), choosing the best option (explore-
exploit behavior), estimating the outcome value (salience attribution) and lastly integrating relevant information
about outcomes and updating the value of stimuli (learning rate). These sub-processes can be quantified by
utilizing computational models. However, prior to building normative models of these RLDM constructs that can
be potentially utilized in clinical practice, it is critical to assess the reliability of these RLDM model-derived
parameters to avoid translational failures. Therefore, our main goals of this proposal are to (1) parse RLDM sub-
processes into mathematically-defined parameters in a large sample using a diverse set of tasks; (2) assess
test-retest reliability of these parameters; and finally (3) build normative models of the parameters and chart the
heterogeneity at the level of the individual. To achieve this goal, we will acquire behavioral data from six RL
tasks, including delay and effort discounting, probabilistic learning, virtual patch foraging, Pavlovian instrumental
transfer and approach-avoid conflict tasks. These tasks are each optimized to measure at least two of the RL
sub-processes separately. We will collect behavioral data and self-report assessments from a community sample
from 1000 participants (aged 18-85). To estimate test-retest reliability of RLDM parameters, we will invite 500
healthy participants from this sample to complete the session again in one week’s time. First, we will apply start-
of-art computational models to quantify RLDM behavior in each subject. Second, we will calculate the test-retest
reliability of these parameters. Third, we will build normative models to link each of the RLDM construct with age
and calculate each subject’s deviation from the norm. Lastly, we will conduct soft clustering on these deviations
to identify clusters and investigate their differences in psychopathology and general functioning.

to identify novel intervention targets based on knowledge of psychological mechanisms, the current
proposal focuses on interpretation bias, the tendency to perceive threat in ambiguous situations. The
overall objective of this project is to empirically test a theoretical model of the intergenerational
transmission of anxiety focused on parent interpretation bias as a root cause. Our specific aims are to test
theorized effects of parent interpretation bias on (1) parent behavior and (2) child interpretation bias and
(3) evaluate potential moderators to refine theories of intergenerational transmission of anxiety and inform
future personalized interventions. Our central hypothesis is that parent interpretation bias influences child
interpretation bias through its effects on maladaptive, anxiety-promoting parenting behaviors, such as
accommodation and modeling of avoidant coping. To test this hypothesis, we will randomize 300 parents
of children ages 7-12 to complete four weeks of a smartphone delivered interpretation bias manipulation
vs. a self-assessment smartphone app condition. The interpretation bias intervention teaches parents to
interpret ambiguous situations in a non-threatening manner via quick, repeated practice and corrective
feedback. Before and after completing their randomly assigned condition, parent-child dyads will complete
self-report and behavioral tasks designed to elicit anxiety-promoting behaviors from parents depending
upon their interpretation of the ambiguous situation (speech and puzzle tasks). Parents will also complete
Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) of parenting behaviors to capture the time course of effects.
Finally, we will examine downstream effects of the interpretation manipulation on child interpretation bias
at pre- and post- visits. We will test moderators (e.g., parent anxiety and gender) to refine theories of
intergenerational transmission of anxiety and inform future personalized interventions. The long-term goal
of this work is to inform personalized, mechanism-focused interventions to improve mental health
outcomes for anxious children and their parents. Future studies will translate knowledge gained from this
project into a scalable treatment that can be implemented entirely remotely via smartphone thereby
increasing access to care.

 Projects like the BRAIN initiative hold the potential for a fundamentally new approach to therapeutics for
severe mental illness. Neuromodulation technologies promise to allow selective intervention in which
pathophysiology is specifically targeted for correction. These initiatives are critically dependent on the correct
identification of circuit dysfunction that causes psychiatric symptoms. NIMH has prioritized this as a strategic
objective: Identify and characterize the neural circuit mechanisms contributing to human behavior and their
disruption in mental illnesses.
 Neuroimaging studies have generated promising leads while almost never demonstrating that these
findings represent targets that can be engaged for therapeutic benefit. We thus lack a key perquisite for
translation into the clinic: For imaging biomarkers to make the leap to translational use, they would need to
accurately identify the circuits that give rise to symptoms.
 In this project we seek to understand how brain circuit dysfunction causes auditory hallucinations in
schizophrenia. Published, technically challenging imaging studies provide a critical clue: These “symptom
capture” experiments that collect MRI imaging during hallucinations have identified a disparate pattern of
activations across multiple subcortical and cortical brain regions. Our hypothesis is that these brain regions
are part of a single circuit than spans cerebellar, thalamic, and cortical brain regions. In our preliminary data we
are able to identify the cerebellar node of this circuit, and then, in an independent cohort of participants with
schizophrenia, we used neuromodulation to manipulate this circuit. We observe that non-invasive
neuromodulation can manipulate connectivity across this entire circuit. Restoration of connectivity in this circuit
is reflected in reduction of hallucination severity.
 In this proposal we seek to confirm and extend this result. We will use non-invasive neuromodulation to
specifically target this circuit and observe change induced on the hallucination circuit in a sham-controlled
study. If successful, this project will establish a circuit-level understanding of how pathophysiology is causally
linked to hallucinations. This kind of mechanistic understanding of schizophrenia symptoms would be
unprecedented and would identify biological target for engagement to reduce these symptoms.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Which psychiatric symptoms and behaviors are the most important to assess and manage during critical
 points in psychiatric healthcare, such as the time leading up to hospital discharge? At present, psychiatry
 lacks objective tests that could inform this and other clinically challenging–and potentially costly–
 decisions. Establishing valid objective markers of psychiatric disease processes is especially challenging
 compared with the development of biomarkers in other 5elds. One key challenge is lack of available data
 from psychiatrically ill patients during key periods in their care trajectory, which the present project seeks
 to address. A second major challenge, also addressed as a core feature in this project, is the complex,
 context-dependence of human behavioral expression, which greatly complicates efforts to establish
 robust, objective measures that re6ect underlying mental health disease processes. This project will
 address both barriers, introducing a new computational framework, named Context-Adaptive Multimodal
 Informatics, to identify and evaluate behavioral biomarkers related to discharge-readiness and
 symptoms in severe mental illness. The project aims to address 5ve fundamental research challenges:
 (1) Acquire a multimodal psychiatric discharge-planning dataset of 400 inpatients with severe mental
 illness; (2) Create self-aware linear and neural models to identify multimodal behavioral biomarkers; (3)
 Develop context-sensitive linear and neural models to contextualize behavioral biomarkers and quantify
 the in6uence of context on behavior; (4) Build a new adaptive assessment planning framework which
 creates a personalized patient analysis to rank contexts and modalities for the next assessment session;
 (5) Assess the trustworthiness and generalizability of our measurements, models, and insights.
 This research will improve basic understanding of social context and behavioral biomarkers, build
 objective measures for mental health assessment, and more broadly, pave the way for a restructured
 care-delivery system in which resources are allocated intelligently to ensure assessments are
 informative with respect to desired clinical objectives.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Project Summary
Differences in cognitive information processing of threat information have been linked with almost every
major psychiatric illness, from anxiety to psychosis to PTSD. And yet, objective, performance-based
measures of such threat sensitivity tend to be (1) unreliable, (2) difficult to scale, and (3) designed for
assessing differences in phenotypic traits rather than characteristics that vary over time. Self-reported
experiences linked with threat processing (e.g. anxiety, hypervigilance, fear), on the other hand, tend to
fluctuate over minutes, hours, and days within individuals. The lack of brief, sensitive, reliable, and
repeatable measures of threat sensitivity thus represents a major gap in our ability to understand how
threat sensitivity is related to mental health, between individuals and over time. The overall goal of the
proposed project is to develop and validate a battery of optimized and generalizable measures for
assessing between and within-person differences in threat sensitivity, for use in high throughput or high
frequency assessment designs. The proposed work is organized around three specific aims. Aim 1 is to
identify and optimize a set of 5 reliable candidate measures, based on an initial set of 25. We will select
and develop measures based on an iterative test development approach, using high-throughput
assessment in N = 75,000 participants to identify parameters, stimuli, and administration characteristics
that allow us to meet pre-specified psychometric and validation benchmarks across device types (see
Research Strategy). Measures that achieve these benchmarks will then be carried over to two large-scale
EMA validation studies: (1) a sample recruited from an acute psychiatric care setting at McLean Hospital
(Aim 2, N = 200) and (2) a diverse Bronx-biased community sample (Aim 3, N = 400). Successful
completion of this project will yield a set of high-quality measures that are validated for research using
both high throughput and high frequency assessment study designs (e.g. EMA), particularly research that
seeks to characterize the temporal dynamics of threat processing or state-related differences in cognition
and symptoms. The proposed research is significant because it will (1) address a critical gap in our ability
to objectively measure cognitive information processing of threat in field test settings, and (2) provide
robust tools for tracking changes in threat sensitivity over time. The proposed research is innovative in
that it (a) employs an iterative test development approach that will allow us to rapidly select and optimize
potential test candidates, administered in naturalistic environments, and (b) allows us to capture both
between and within-subject variability as potential avenues for identifying mechanisms that contribute to
mental disorders Our team is uniquely positioned to accomplish these aims, given our expertise in
developing and evaluating mobile cognitive assessments, psychometrics, fear and threat information
processing, and infrastructure for disseminating cognitive measures in large cohorts and nationally.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Bipolar disorder (BD) is characterized by profound affective dysregulation. Periods of aversive symptoms
(depression, anxiety, decreased appetitive drive), alternate with mania (a state of enhanced appetitive drive for
reward and pleasure). The clinical manifestation is heterogeneous, with diverse patterns of predominant
symptoms, severity and duration. Notably, there are no current robust neurocircuit models to account for these
clinical manifestations. Imaging and postmortem studies point to the amygdala, a nucleus embedded in circuits
involved in threat and reward responses. Recent breakthroughs from our group and others are beginning to
characterize molecularly identifiable, functionally divergent sets of amygdala neurons, which separately encode
and regulate aversive and appetitive behaviors. Specifically, distinct neuronal types within the mouse amygdala
promote aversive/fear responses (`FEAR-ON' neurons), vs. appetitive/reward responses (`APPT-ON' neurons).
Our preliminary data using single-cell RNA sequencing show that analogous molecularly defined neuronal
populations are present in human amygdala. Our overarching hypothesis is that neuronal populations
impacting valence encoding and motivated behavior (FEAR-ON vs. APPT-ON neurons), are disrupted in BD,
contributing to depression, anxiety and mania.
What factors may regulate the functions of FEAR-ON and APPT-ON circuitry in health and disease states? An
answer may lie within the distinctive molecular signatures of these neurons, consistent with their opposing
functions. First, FEAR-ON and APPT-ON neurons express distinct molecular factors known to regulate
fear/threat and reward processing within the amygdala, including anxiogenic (e.g. corticotropic releasing
hormone [CRH]) and anxiolytic (e.g. neurotensin receptor 2 [NTSR2]) factors, respectively. Second, a well-
validated distinguishing feature of amygdala FEAR-ON and APPT-ON neurons is their distinct expression pattern
of Wnt/β catenin signaling molecules. This feature indicates that Wnt/β catenin pathways differentially regulate
FEAR-ON and APPT-ON neurons. Pilot data also show altered expression of key molecules, including Wnt7a
and CRH in the amygdala of people with BD. Our specific hypothesis is that cell-specific FEAR-ON and APPT-
ON molecular factors modulating stress/anxiety and reward/appetitive behaviors are altered in BD, and that
disruption of Wnt/β catenin pathways contributes to distinct abnormalities FEAR-ON and APPT-ON neurons.
Human postmortem studies combining single-cell RNAseq, multiplex mRNA/protein cell labeling and quantitative
analyses of RDoC clinical domains will test the hypothesis that quantifiable clinical `fingerprints' in BD are
predictive of distinct patterns of molecular changes in FEAR-ON and APPT-ON neurons (Aims 1 and 2). Causal
manipulation in mouse genetic models will mechanistically test the hypothesis that a disruption of Wnt signaling
causally alters expression of reward- and stress- related molecules in circuits linking deep amygdala nuclei to
the CE and nucleus accumbens (Aim 3).

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Dissociative symptoms in traumatized individuals are common, debilitating, and costly; however, little is
known about how its biological mechanisms interact with PTSD treatment. Traumatic dissociation broadly
encompasses a range of distinct, yet clinically interrelated symptoms: depersonalization, derealization,
amnesia, numbing, flashbacks, passive influence phenomena, and identity disturbances. Either alone or in
various combinations, these symptoms serve as diagnostic criteria and commonly associated features across
multiple psychiatric disorders. Traumatic dissociation is also associated with significant personal and societal
burden. Traumatized individuals with dissociative symptoms typically have co-occurring psychiatric conditions,
high rates of self-destructive behaviors and suicidality, and are disproportionate treatment utilizers. In addition,
they are at increased risk for attrition, non-response and relapse following treatment interventions. Despite the
significant and disabling nature of traumatic dissociative symptoms, little is known about the neurobiology of
these processes and targeted interventions do not exist.
 PTSD treatment studies have neither looked at neural intermediate phenotypes of dissociation, nor how
these are associated with psychophysiological and digital phenotypes. Compared to clinical symptom
measures, these biological and in-the-moment digital markers of dissociation may more robustly map onto the
underlying core aspects of the disorder differentiating dissociation subtypes following childhood and adult
trauma. We propose to build upon our prior Exploratory R21 to now capture longitudinal multimodal phenotype
data related to dissociation, pre-, post- and during PTSD treatment modalities that include empirically-derived,
exposure-based components.
 The goals of this study will be 1) to understand the differential biomarkers that map onto dissociative
symptoms, and 2) to understand how these biomarkers may best predict trajectory of response to empirically
based standard-of-care treatments. For each of these Aims, we will collect Neuroimaging, Physiology, and
Digital Phenotyping data, applying computational modeling with multimodal data to provide machine-learning
based, unbiased predictive models of dissociative intermediate phenotypes at baseline and longitudinally. This
naturalistic study will allow us to map the biology of dissociation, and importantly, the change in dissociative
symptoms and underlying biomarkers over time, using naturalistic evidenced-based treatment for PTSD in 130
treatment-seeking patients with PTSD, and a range of dissociative symptoms.
 Successful completion of these Aims will provide a novel and powerful understanding of the biological
markers of dissociation subtypes following trauma exposure, and will identify biological mechanisms for
understanding and treating PTSD with dissociation.

 Major depressive disorder (MDD) is uncommon in childhood, but becomes increasingly prevalent
during adolescence. By the age of 18, about 15% of adolescents will have experienced at least one episode of
MDD, with females twice as likely than males to have suffered an episode. This developmental surge in
depression is especially high among teens who have a parent with a history of MDD, with close to half
developing the disorder by the end of adolescence. Despite these epidemiological findings, and the range of
negative downstream consequences linked to MDD, there are strikingly little data on the neural and behavioral
abnormalities that confer risk for future depression onset in youth. The ability to prospectively predict MDD
prior to its onset would have important clinical implications for the early identification of – and targeted
deployment of interventions for – at-risk youth, which is strongly aligned with the NIMH Strategic Plan.
 To address these gaps, adolescents ages 12-15 at increased risk of MDD onset by virtue of a parental
history of MDD, as well as a control sample with no parental history of depression, will complete baseline
neural (fMRI) and behavioral assessments of replicated endophenotypes of MDD (neuroticism, anhedonia,
cognitive control deficits). Growing evidence and our preliminary data suggest that these endophenotypes are
relatively stable trait-like risk markers, have non-overlapping neural substrates, and precede and prospectively
predict depression onset. The project has three aims. First, we will evaluate the neural correlates of these
three endophenotypes in an adolescent sample (n = 148), half of whom are at elevated risk of MDD (Aim 1).
Second, during a 24-month follow-up phase, participants will be contacted by phone every 6 months and
administered measures to assess changes in symptoms. Analyses will test whether behavioral and neural
endophenotype measures prospectively predict onset of depressive symptoms during the follow-up phase.
Importantly, to evaluate incremental predictive validity, we will test whether each endophenotype measure
predicts future depressive symptoms above and beyond relevant clinical, familial/demographic and
developmental variables previously linked with risk of future depression (Aim 2). Third, we will test whether
multivariate machine learning models incorporating behavioral and neural endophenotype markers, as well as
clinical, familial/demographic, and developmental characteristics, can be used to predict subject-specific risk of
future depression onset with sufficiently high sensitivity and specificity to be clinically useful (Aim 3). Critically,
recent advances in machine learning allow for the development of algorithms predicting risk at the individual
level, as well as the integration of numerous predictors rather than relying on single variables that may, in
isolation, have limited clinically-useful predictive value. Collectively, results are expected to advance our ability
to predict the onset of depressive symptoms and, ultimately, to inform the development of a freely available,
web-based risk calculator for predicting subject-specific depression risk.

Although exposure and response prevention (ERP) is well-established as the first line of treatment for obsessive-
compulsive disorder (OCD), 40-50% of patients who receive this intervention do not recover. Novel
augmentations are needed to more efficiently target the mechanisms that maintain OCD symptoms in this
population. One candidate mechanism is interpretation bias, the misinterpretation of ambiguous stimuli as
threatening, contributing to the development and maintenance of OCD. In the absence of interventions that more
efficiently and effectively target interpretation bias, it will likely remain difficult to increase rates of treatment
response and decrease relapse. The objective of this proposal is to test the feasibility, acceptability, adherence,
target engagement, and clinical outcomes of an intervention targeting interpretation bias, with the ultimate goal
of contributing to the development of novel, scalable, technology-driven augmentations to ERP. Improvements
in interpretation bias have been associated with OC symptom reduction. Therefore, an accessible intervention
which directly targets interpretation bias may be an ideal augmentation to improve clinical outcomes during ERP.
Cognitive Bias Modification for Interpretation Bias (CBM-I), a computerized intervention, has shown reliable
effects for engagement of interpretation. Studies of CBM-I in OCD have been largely conducted in analogue
samples, and studies with clinical samples have been limited. This proposal will address the critical need of
developing interventions to augment ERP by utilizing CBM-I, with primary aims to: 1) test whether CBM-I induces
changes in interpretation bias in OCD and to determine if these changes are associated with clinical outcomes
across multi-modal assessments, and 2) leverage advances in machine learning to develop personalized
predictions of which individuals with OCD are best-suited for CBM-I. We hypothesize that a multivariate model
incorporating pre-treatment clinical, behavioral and demographic characteristics will predict patient-specific
probability of responding to CBM-I. These aims map onto the candidate’s training goals, with critical new training
and mentorship provided in the areas of: 1) effectiveness trials methodology with an experimental therapeutics
approach (Co-Primary Mentor Dr. Courtney Beard; Co-Mentor Dr. Sabine Wilhelm); 2) ecological momentary
assessment (Co-Primary Mentors Dr. Christian Webb and Dr. Beard; Collaborator Dr. Justin Baker); 3) machine
learning techniques (Dr. Webb and Collaborator Dr. Boyu Ren); and 4) career development (Co-Mentor Dr. Kerry
Ressler). This K23 Award will support an innovative program of patient-oriented research and provide the
candidate with the skills necessary to become an independent investigator focused on advancing the
understanding, prediction, and treatment of non-response and relapse, to optimize outcomes of exposure
therapy for refractory patients with OC-related disorders.

 Understanding the neurobiology mediating susceptibility to trauma and stress-related disorders is
necessary for future translational efforts to improve treatment and prevention. This Mentored Career
Development Award proposal is tailored to facilitate the candidate’s training in multimodal assessment of brain
and behavior, in addition to clinical assessment and computational psychiatry approaches, to elucidate the
neurobiology of susceptibility to posttraumatic dysfunction. The proposed research training plan will build the
candidate’s skills in multidimensional assessment of perceptual (i.e., visual) processing in the early aftermath of
trauma, advanced computational modeling of behavioral processes, and ‘big-data’ modeling approaches for
fusion of multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. This training is complemented by mentored
training in clinical assessment of trauma-related dysfunction and research program management necessary for
transition to an independent career as a translational neuroscientist. The completion of the K01 will facilitate the
candidate’s transition to an independent investigator capable of developing new neuroscience-based predictive
models and preventative strategies to lessen the burden of trauma and stress-related disorders.
 PTSD is typically conceptualized as a dysfunction of arousal and negative valence systems with the NIH
Research Domain Criteria framework. However, new research demonstrates that neural circuitry of affective
visual perceptual processing, in particular affective visual processing, may be a significant risk factor for PTSD.
Limited work to date has probed affective visual circuitry in the early aftermath of trauma. The proposed research
will leverage state-of-the-art MRI data collection and analysis with computational cognitive neuroscience
approaches to elucidate impacts of trauma on affective visual processing. The project will thus better
characterize an understudied aspect of the RDoC perceptual framework in trauma to integrate visual circuitry
variability in both threat-related processes and PTSD-related dysfunction.
 Previous research in recently traumatized individuals has also not leveraged multimodal data approaches
to establish generalizable markers of PTSD susceptibility. This project will address these limitations by focusing
on perceptual circuits and by integrating pre-existing large datasets of trauma and PTSD with multimodal data
fusion analytics to assess the robustness of observed neurobiological signatures of trauma-related dysfunction
vulnerability. Further, the proposal seeks to use standardized, open processing pipelines to enhance
reproducibility and replicability of observed findings to promote generalizability. The research training plan will
occur at McLean Hospital, the leading psychiatric research hospital of Harvard Medical School. The institution,
and academic culture in greater Boston provides an outstanding environment and access to resources for
successful competition of this proposed Mentored Career Development Award.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Though stress is necessary for the adaptive survival of a species, stress exposure can also elicit maladaptive
physiological and behavioral responses. Stress-induced maladaptive responses may lead to subsequent
development of psychiatric disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and major depressive
disorder (MDD). A core symptom observed in these disorders is increased fear expression, as defined by
heightened fear responses in the presence of stimuli associated with fear. We have previously discovered that
a single injection of (R,S)-ketamine, a rapid-acting antidepressant, attenuates learned fear following contextual
fear conditioning (CFC). We and others have reported that the ventral hippocampus (vHPC), specifically
ventral CA3 (vCA3), mediates (R,S)-ketamine’s effects on attenuating learned fear. However, how exactly
(R,S)-ketamine modulates the ensembles in vCA3 to decrease fear generalization is yet to be explored. It has
additionally been shown that ventral CA1 (vCA1) contributes to fear behavior. Thus, this research plan will lay
the groundwork to uncover the effects of (R,S)-ketamine administration on fear behavior using of in vivo
microdialysis to complement and further explain the data already collected from in vivo Ca2+ imaging in vCA3
and vCA1. Overall, my goal for this proposal is to better understand how (R,S)-ketamine alters
neurotransmitters and neuronal ensembles to buffer against heightened fear expression. My preliminary
findings outlined in Aim 1 show that (R,S)-ketamine: 1) blunts responses to shocks during fear encoding
specifically in vCA3; 2) differentially affects activity in ventral hippocampal regions CA3 and CA1; and 3)
decreases correlated activity in the ventral hippocampus during both fear encoding and retrieval. Together,
these findings lead me to my hypothesis that there are distinct changes in neurotransmitter content
immediately following (R,S)-ketamine administration that are long-lasting and that blunt the experience of a
fearful stressor. However, to test this hypothesis, I need to utilize in vivo microdialysis as outlined in Aim 2 to
measure levels of glutamate, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and serotonin (5-HT) in vCA3 or vCA1 of
male and female mice to understand how they potentially mediate (R,S)-ketamine’s effects. To date, no
longitudinal studies utilizing in vivo Ca2+ imaging or in vivo microdialysis studies have yet been performed
investigating (R,S)-ketamine effects on fear behavior. In Aim 3, I describe a postdoctoral research direction to
accomplish my goal of understanding the biological substrates of stress resilience. I have gained experience in
behavior, in vivo techniques, cellular and molecular neuroscience, and microscopy. However, I have yet to
conduct techniques that manipulate circuits, or that probe the contribution of transcriptomic changes after drug
treatment or with stress. Thus, I plan to address these gaps in my knowledge by finding a post-doctoral
position that allows me to grow in these skills. In summary, this proposal will lead to the development of a
diverse skillset in order to become a successful independent researcher in the psychiatric field.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Project Summary/Abstract: This proposal is to fund a complete refurbishment of the McLean Hospital 9.4 Tesla
/ 400 mm Agilent pre-clinical Magnetic Resonance Imaging system. This system is the largest active shield pre-
clinical magnet in the world (there is a passive shield prototype magnet in Hefei, China) and provides scanning
and spectroscopy for a range of subject species by using insertable gradient coils: a large gradient, ID = 260
mm; a middle gradient, ID = 115 mm; and a small gradient, ID=60 mm. This instrument has been productive
since it was first installed in 2008 in studying a variety of species from mice through macaques for both
morphometric imaging scans, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and spectroscopy (MRS) in rodents
and in non-human primates. This proposal is to refurbish and upgrade the system, bringing it to state-of-the-art
technology so it is ready for the next decade of its service to the McLean Hospital research community.
There are three motivations for upgrading this MR system at this time. First, its electronic equipment and gradient
coils are 15 years old and are in need of replacement. Connectors and components within the electronics, are
expected to fail in the next few years due to normal usage; the gradient coils are made of epoxy and subjected
to strong vibration during scanning and need replacement before mechanical failure. These are common needs
for MR systems with upgrades normally spaced 10 years apart. Second, this system was originally built by
Varian, but was acquired by Agilent, who now provides technical support. Agilent has discontinued its MRI
product line, and service and parts will cease to be available over the next few years – this application is for an
upgrade to Bruker AVNEO electronics, which will then end our dependence on Agilent and instead will benefit
from the full support of Bruker Inc. and offer a future development path. This upgrade is necessary for the system
to continue operating. Third, due to its age, our 9.4T lacks many of the more advanced acquisition methods
necessary for fMRI and MRS such as MPRAGE sequences, parallel acquisitions with RF array coils for fMRI,
and two-dimensional, J-resolved spectroscopic imaging (MEGAPRESS) to name a few. The need for state-of-
the-art hardware and acquisition methods drive this upgrade. The unique magnet upon which the system is
based is in like-new condition and will last another 10-15 years or longer.
Relevance: The McLean 9.4T scanner is one of the most capable systems in the US for pre-clinical scanning,
providing imaging and spectroscopy for a wide range of species from mice to macaques. This upgrade will keep
this scanner at the forefront of the field and will open up new opportunities for rapidly translating discoveries
made in other animals to humans.

Exposure therapy is the most effective treatment available for obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), yet up to
50% of patients do not recover. Progress has stalled because we do not fully understand how or why exposure
exerts its effects. Studies that test mechanistic theories of exposure (based on habituation or inhibitory learning
models) have yielded mixed findings for both self-report and physiological mechanisms, with a near exclusive
focus on group-level effects in tightly controlled settings. While exposure likely works differently for different
people, research on which mechanisms are most important for which individuals has been absent. As a result,
clinicians are left to navigate mixed findings from different theoretical models, leading to variability in how they
conduct exposure and greater treatment failures among patients suffering with OCD. The primary objective of
this proposal is to determine which target mechanisms are most critical to engage in real-world exposure
sessions to produce treatment response. Adult participants (N = 400) with OCD receiving exposure therapy
from two sites (McLean Hospital, San Diego State University) across the continuum of care (outpatient, partial
hospital, residential) will complete baseline clinical and demographic measures as well as weekly symptom
reports. We will measure exposure mechanisms across three levels of analysis (self-report, observer-rated
behavior, physiology) during each exposure session. Mechanisms assessed will include a broad range of
variables based on both habituation and inhibitory learning models of exposure. For self-report and observer-
rated mechanisms, we will use the Exposure Feedback Form (EFF), created and piloted by the study team.
For physiological mechanisms, we will measure skin conductance response, heart rate, and heart rate
variability via a wearable device. Leveraging machine learning analyses, we will develop a predictive model of
patient outcomes (OCD symptoms) that incorporates both mechanistic data and baseline demographic and
clinical characteristics. At the group level, we will test the hypotheses that incorporation of mechanistic
variables will improve predictive performance over baseline variables alone, and that greater habituation and
inhibitory learning will predict superior clinical outcomes. At the individual level, we will test the hypotheses that
lower baseline depression and greater anxiety sensitivity will predict stronger habituation-outcome
relationships, whereas lower baseline self-efficacy and sexual minority identity will predict stronger inhibitory
learning-outcome relationships. This will be the first study to predict mechanism-outcome relationships for
exposure therapy based on individual characteristics. Consistent with NIMH’s Strategic Objective 3, this
proposal aims to identify therapeutic targets for personalized interventions by utilizing innovative machine
learning approaches with scalable methods. Future studies will translate insights gained from this project to
test implementation of personalized medicine approaches to exposure therapy, with the ultimate goal of
improving care for the many patients who do not remit following exposure for OCD.

Schizophrenia (SZ) is a devastating psychiatric disorder that brings heavy burden to health care systems. A
large literature indicates that individuals with SZ show markers of early aging, such as faster decline in cognitive
functioning, increased risk for dementia, and significantly shorter life expectancies. Interestingly, the increased
rate of dementia in SZ cannot be fully accounted for by the established dementia risk factors or the pathology of
neurodegenerative disorders, suggesting additional pathological causes of cognitive impairment and increased
mortality in older SZ patients. Additionally, many SZ patients develop medical conditions such as diabetes,
metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular disease, conditions often exacerbated by side effects of antipsychotic
medications. However, it is unclear whether these phenomena reflect premature aging early in life, accelerated
pace of aging later, toxic effects of chronic psychosis with antipsychotic therapy, or a mixture of all three. Recent
advances in the field of early psychosis including our own work suggest that an “immuno-oxidative” pathway,
including NMDA receptor hypofunction/glutamatergic dysfunction, bioenergetic impairment/redox dysregulation,
and neuroinflammation, form a “central hub” of brain pathology in SZ. These biochemical abnormalities result in
neuronal dysfunction that eventually might disrupt the long distance and large-scale neuronal communication,
thereby leading to cognitive dysfunction. To study these phenomena, we have developed novel neuroimaging
approaches to measure the redox ratio (NAD+/NADH) in vivo, as well as other markers of mitochondrial function,
including creatine kinase (CK)/ATPase activity and the antioxidant glutathione (GSH)—a molecule essential for
cellular repair that has functional ties to NAD. Research has shed some light on these mechanisms in early
phases of SZ and transition to chronic illness. However, little progress has been made in understanding their
role across the lifespan in SZ, despite the fact that these abnormalities are closely linked with the diverse early
aging phenomena seen in SZ. In this application, we propose to extend our previous research on the early stage
of SZ to older populations to examine the trajectory of biochemical abnormalities in SZ. Our overarching
hypothesis is that metabolic and redox abnormalities continue to unfold over the lifespan and are associated
with additional sequelae for impaired brain function in SZ. To capture the full aging trajectory, we propose an
accelerated longitudinal design where we recruit patients with SZ and age/sex-matched healthy controls (HC)
between the ages of 40-70. We will collect a broad neurochemical profile as described above, but also structural,
functional, and vascular neuroimaging, as well as comprehensive cognitive and clinical assessments. This rich
dataset will enable us to explore dynamic mental illness trajectories. It may provide targets for future interventions
to slow down abnormal aging, reduce risk of dementia, and delay mortality among people with SZ.

The therapeutic window for treatment of schizophrenia (SZ) with antipsychotics is limited. Excessive dosage
of antipsychotics may lead to dopamine supersensitivity psychosis (DSP), a condition when dopamine D2high
receptors (the active form of the D2 receptor) are upregulated in the mesolimbic system, in turn causing a
need to escalate antipsychotics dose to alleviate the symptoms. To avoid DSP, it is necessary to closely
monitor the changes in D2high. This can be accomplished using a specific D2high receptor agonist, visualized
through positron emission tomography (PET). We have synthesized MCL-524, a highly selective D2 agonist
which is characterized by sub-nanomolar binding affinity to D2high, minimal affinity to other D2-like receptors
or to other dopamine or non-dopamine receptor families, good metabolic stability, and good permeation
through the blood brain barrier. Preliminary data in rats indicate a good ADME profile, with high binding in
the D2-rich striatum, and low binding in other brain regions and peripheral organs. This ligand must be
rigorously and reproducibly characterized before it can be tested in humans. In aim 1, we will complete
preclinical experiments to ensure safety and reliability of MCL-524, including broad off-target binding, ADME
evaluation, and a 14-day toxicology study in rats. In aim 2, we will evaluate the test-retest variability and
biodistribution of [18F]MCL-524 in rhesus monkeys to increase rigor and reproducibility for clinical studies. In
aim 3, we will test in vivo selectivity of [18F]MCL-524 using specific antagonist for D2 (benperidol) and D3
(SB277011A) in PET imaging studies: first we will use micro-PET to assess binding and specificity of
[18F]MCL-524 in the presence and absence of benperidol or SB277011A in control and amphetamine
sensitized rats, an established model of up-regulated D2high receptors, in vivo. In a second approach, we will
test [18F]MCL-524 in analogous blocking studies in non-human primates (macaque monkeys) which are
physiologically closer to humans than rodents, using PET. In aim 4, we will perform studies to support an
investigational New Drug (IND) application, namely GMP synthesis and formulation in the CMC (chemistry,
manufacturing, and control) program to ensure a reproducible and validated method of radiolabeling and
dosage administration. Antipsychotics are the primary means of illness management in SZ, and a better
understanding of the etiology of DSP will allow us to avoid it in patients, improving their overall outcome. The
overarching goal is to develop MCL-524 as a PET radiotracer and a predictive biomarker of dopaminergic
treatment responses in SZ, to minimize the incidence of DSP. Ultimately, this tool will improve patient`s lives
and reduce the socioeconomic burden associated with schizophrenia.

The clinical high-risk (CHR) or “prodromal” framework has provided a platform for tracking the onset of psychosis
and identifying the neurodevelopmental mechanisms of risk for this disorder. It is now well established, however,
that affective symptoms in CHR samples are essentially universal, persist longitudinally, and contribute to
disability regardless of psychosis transition. Given the substantial neurobiological proximity of psychotic and
affective disorders, the extent to which current biomarkers in CHR reflect risk for psychosis, common affective
illness, or both remains largely unknown. Broadening the scope of detection to the early affective stages has
potential to strengthen pathogenic models of psychosis by highlighting shared and unique vulnerability
mechanisms while informing treatments that are relevant to a wider range of individuals. This study will identify
shared and differential impairments of stress and reward processing among youth with psychosis-risk syndromes
or early-stage depression (ESD). In a task-based fMRI design, youth with CHR, ESD, or no psychopathology
will complete a probabilistic reinforcement learning paradigm before and after an acute stress manipulation.
Using an established computational model we will generate estimates of theoretically relevant learning
parameters, compare them across groups, and relate them to neural and hormonal data. We hypothesize that
the striatum represents a shared locus of reward-based dysfunction across the early and high-risk stages of
psychosis and depression, but risk-specific differences may lie within the prefrontal cortex. The results of this
study will represent a significant step forward in our transdiagnostic understanding of emerging psychopathology,
with implications for both generalizable and personalized intervention. By the end of the project period I will have
established expertise in task-based fMRI research, independence in computational modeling of behavior, and
expert knowledge of the interplay between stress, reward, and neurodevelopment across mood and psychotic
disorders. Together this will provide a unique combination of clinical and methodological expertise and prepare
me for my long-term goal of improving preventative intervention through longitudinal research.

We will develop and apply a new high-throughput methodology for rapidly
designing and testing antibodies for a myriad of purposes, including cancer and
infectious disease immunotherapeutics. We will improve upon current
approaches for antibody design by providing time, cost, and humane benefits
over immunized animal methods and greatly improving the power of present
synthetic methods that use randomized designs. To accomplish this, we will
display millions of computationally designed antibody sequences using recently
available technology, test the displayed antibodies in a high-throughput format at
low cost, and use the resulting test data to train molecular dynamics and
machine learning methods to generate new sequences for testing. Based on our
test data our computational method will identify sequences that have ideal
properties for target binding and therapeutic efficacy. We will accomplish these
goals with three specific aims. We will develop a new approach to integrated
molecular dynamics and machine learning using control targets and known
receptor sequences to refine our methods for receptor generalization and model
updating from observed data (Aim 1). We will design an iterative framework
intended to enable identification of highly effective antibodies within a minimal
number of experiments, in which our methods automatically propose promising
antibody sequences to profile in subsequent assays (Aim 2). We will employ
rounds of automated synthetic design, affinity test, and model improvement to
produce highly target-specific antibodies. (Aim 3).

The majority of licensed vaccines are thought to elicit protection mediated by humoral immunity. A key
determinant of the specificity and affinity of the antibody response is the germinal center (GC) response elicited
by immunization, wherein B cells enter GCs to undergo cyclic rounds of proliferation and somatic hypermutation
to evolve higher-affinity antibodies, followed by exit from the GC to become long-lived plasma cells or memory
B cells. Effective GC responses are thought to be critical for difficult pathogens such as HIV, and even for easily-
neutralized viruses such as SARS-CoV-2, effective and long-lived GC responses are associated with more
effective cross-neutralization of viral variants. Hence, optimizing GC responses is fundamental to vaccines
broadly. In recent work, we have studied how vaccine kinetics– the temporal pattern of antigen and adjuvant
exposure during immunization– impact humoral immunity and GC reaction in particular. Our preliminary studies
have revealed that prolonged delivery of antigen to draining lymph nodes over a period of 2-3 weeks substantially
alters the immune response. One particularly effective immunization approach, which we term “extended
dosing” (ext-dosing) immunization, involves administering a given total dose of vaccine antigen and adjuvant
as a half-dozen injections over two weeks in an escalating-dose pattern. Ext-dosing enhances the magnitude
of the GC response in both small and large animal models and increases the clonality (number of distinct B cell
clones participating in the GC), leading to enhanced neutralizing antibody production. These dramatic effects of
ext-dosing vaccination warrant close study to understand how and why this strategy is so effective. As ext-dosing
through repeat injections is not practical for human immunization, we are also highly motivated to develop
alternate strategies to achieve the same immunologic effects without the need for 6 or more injections. To
address these goals, our specific aims are (1) define how antigen exposure kinetics govern the immune
response elicited by ext-dosing immunization, (2) determine how adjuvant exposure kinetics impact the immune
response in ext-dosing, (3) test strategies to achieve “extended-dosing” effects using bolus subunit vaccine
administration, and (4) to evaluate the potential for ext-dosing-like effects in mRNA vaccines. Altogether, these
studies will both clarify fundamental concepts underlying effective primary immune responses and develop new
translationally-relevant approaches to enhance immune responses elicited by subunit and mRNA vaccines. We
test-bed these concepts using clinically-relevant antigens and adjuvants, and aim to pursue strategies we expect
to be broadly applicable to vaccines independent of disease target.

 When a new route is learned, what happens in the hippocampus? How fast do these changes occur? Are
all hippocampal subfields involved in memory encoding? Decades of research have shown that the hippocampus
is necessary for spatial memory. However, the neural foundation of spatial learning and memory and its link to
hippocampal architecture remain major study topics. According to animal research, learning alters the functional,
chemical, and structural properties of hippocampal cells. Unfortunately, we know considerably less about
humans' microstructural basis of learning and memory. An accurate assessment of learning-induced
hippocampal neuroplasticity —the ability of the hippocampus to modify its function and structure in response to
information—would significantly enhance human memory research. For decades, we have lacked the
noninvasive technology necessary to evaluate neuroplasticity with the same biological precision as animals.
Diffusion Magnetic Resonance imaging (dMRI) holds the most promise among non-invasive technology to reveal
the microstructural substrate of learning and memory in humans. Initial studies in healthy humans have shown
that dMRI can be sensitive to changes during learning. But technological limitations in gradient technology have
diminished the expectations of what the diffusion MRI signal can reveal in term of specificity to the different
cellular processes that are thought to be involved in neuroplasticity.
 This K99/R00 proposal takes advantage of newly available ultra-high gradient strength dMRI at the MGH
Martinos Center to create a noninvasive marker of learning-induced neuroplasticity in the human hippocampus
subfields during human navigation with a high level of biological specificity. I will combine behavioral testing,
high-resolution functional MRI, state-of-the-art multi-compartment gray matter dMRI models, and ultra-high
gradient strength (500 mT/m) high-resolution dMRI data acquired with our center's BRAIN Initiative-funded
Connectome 2.0 MRI scanner to achieve a unified view of the structural-functional response of the human
hippocampus in spatial memory. The in vivo neuroplasticity marker developed in this proposal might be used as
a diagnostic tool in Alzheimer's disease to detect early indications of pathological hippocampus remodeling or to
assess the efficacy of deep brain stimulation (DBS) techniques for memory impairment repair. The project makes
use of the vast expertise of my mentors and collaborators in cognitive neuroscience, high-gradient strength
dMRI, hippocampal anatomy, and high-resolution functional MRI. The candidate aims to get the necessary skills
to begin an independent long-term research program focused on developing the next generation of in vivo
functional and diffusion MRI technologies to connect cellular-specific information with cognition and brain
functioning. The training component of the K99/R00 award will enrich the candidate's prior strong expertise in
mathematical modeling, diffusion image acquisition, and reconstruction, with complementary skills in behavioral
testing, fMRI analysis, hippocampus anatomy, and the validation of dMRI biomarkers of brain microstructure.

immune response against the retina and uveal tissues. In autoimmune uveitis, the retina and uveal tissues
become a target of autoreactive immune cells, which leads to irreversible neural damages and can progress to
significant visual impairment. Since the retina is a so-called “immune privileged” tissue protected by blood-
retinal barrier, how immune cells gain entry into the retina and what antigen presenting cell (APC) populations
are involved in local antigen presentation have been a long discussion. This proposal describes aims to
elucidate an innovative mechanism whereby retinal microglia mediate autoreactive immune cell entry into the
retina. Microglia are the resident immune cells of the central nervous system, including the retina, and function
in the homeostatic maintenance of the neuro-retinal microenvironment. The role and function of microglia in
disease progression is not well understood due to their multiple phenotypes and/or different stages of
activation that are associated with either harmful or beneficial effects in disease pathogenesis.
Our recent work demonstrated that microglial depletion inhibits development of EAU and that microglia are
essential to disease induction. Interestingly, retinal microglia are significantly activated in response to EAU
disease induction, quickly localizing to the retinal vasculature. However, our data indicated that microglia do
not function as APCs in disease initiation, but in fact function to facilitate infiltration of a variety of circulating
immune cells into the neuroretina. Our data highly suggested that microglia are key population that initiates
blood-retinal barrier breakdown and that the circulating APCs and T cells that enter the retina trigger the
subsequent vision altering auto-inflammatory response. However, the mechanisms by which this occurs
remains unknown.
In this proposal, we will elucidate the mechanism by which autoreactive immune cells gain entry into the retina
and how the subsequent autoimmune response develops during disease progression in a mouse model of
experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU). We will begin by defining the initiating APC populations in EAU and
the contribution of microglial expression of MHC-II during EAU disease progression. Moreover, we will identify
the activation and kinetics of retinal microglia and infiltrating immune cells in EAU induction by using a single
cell RNA sequence profiling. Lastly, we will define the role of SIRPalpha/CD47, an immune axis that is highly
regulated in EAU and that functions in phagocytosis initiation and immune cell reactivity. Understanding the
mechanism by which microglia initiate autoimmune uveitis will likely open new avenues of therapy for this
disease as well as other blinding neovascular ophthalmic diseases.

Background Information and Relevance: Glucocorticoids (GC) are widely used in ophthalmology and in
medicine in general. GC-induced ocular hypertension (OHTN) is a common complication that can be
potentially blinding. The rate of this complication for GC injected intravitreally varies between 28-34%
depending on the formulation injected. This complication's risk factors are not well understood but there is
long-standing evidence that genetic factors play a role. Few genetic studies have been undertaken to identify
the implicated variants and no consistent findings have been identified. Hypotheses: Genetic susceptibility to
GC-induced OHTN is due to both common and rare variation, and associated variants are more likely to be
found in genes with transcripts altered by exposure to GC as well as genes that have glucocorticoid response
elements (GREs) or have been associated with primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) or intraocular pressure
(IOP). Specific Objectives: 1.To characterize the GC transcriptome in human trabecular meshwork (TM) cells
and Schlemm's canal endothelial (SCE) cells. 2. To perform genome-wide genotyping and whole exome
sequencing (WES) on 1086 patients with intravitreal GC injection exposure. 3. To identify common and rare
genetic variants in both coding and non-coding regions that are associated with GC-induced IOP elevation.
Methods: We will expose human TM and SCE cells to dexamethasone as well as media controls and perform
RNA sequencing to identify genes that are transcriptionally regulated by GCs. We will perform genome-wide
genotyping and WES on 1086 patients who have received an intravitreal GC injection and have serial IOP
measurements. Genotyping and WES will be performed as a cost efficient approach for the analyses
proposed. We will examine the GC-induced OHTN both as a quantitative trait of change in IOP adjusted for
baseline IOP and a dichotomous trait (GC responders vs. non-responders). We will execute genome-wide
association and WES analyses as well as targeted analyses. We will target variants in genes that are
transcriptionally regulated by GCs as identified in Aim 1, in loci with GREs, and in genes previously associated
with IOP or POAG. We will examine rare variants in the same loci for association with disease outcome using
aggregate and burden tests. We will enroll a replication cohort of 530 participants and perform targeted
sequencing to follow up suggestive or significant findings from the discovery analyses. We will also perform in
silico replication of these findings in three external cohorts with existing genomic data. Implications: If genes
associated with GC-induced IOP rise are identified, they will not only provide insights into this complication's
pathophysiology, but also into POAG mechanisms more broadly. Our findings will have implications for clinical
management of patients on GC. If we are able to identify patients at risk of GC-induced OHTN, we may avoid
morbidity by using alternative therapies or increasing surveillance while patients receive GC.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
 Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of blindness in the elderly in developed
nations, representing a significant socioeconomic burden. Even though its multifactorial nature is well
recognized, the pathogenesis of AMD is not fully understood. This has led to the current absence of treatments
for dry AMD and lack of reliable ways to determine risk prediction for progression. Thus, there is great need for
better understanding of AMD pathobiology and identification of biomarkers.
 Our group has reported (PMID 28542375, 28916333 and 30672297) and there is new data showing
that metabolomics—the qualitative and quantitative analysis of metabolites (molecules <1 kDa)—is an
appropriate approach to address these needs. While the metabolome is downstream of the genome,
transcriptome, and proteome, it is simultaneously impacted by a wide range of environmental exposures.
Therefore, the metabolome closely represents phenotype, as demonstrated in complex conditions, such as
cancer and Alzheimer’s disease. To evaluate the role of metabolomics in AMD, we initiated a cross sectional
study in which we prospectively recruited 491 patients, obtained an ophthalmological exam and collected
fasting blood and urine samples. Analysis of the blood samples identified changes in the metabolomics profile
of patients with AMD compared to controls, with differences across AMD severity stages. These differences
were mostly found in the lipid pathways, in particular glycerophospholipids and sphingolipids, and purines.
 In this application, our goal is to provide novel insights into the pathogenesis of AMD, and to identify
metabolomic signals that can lead to future biomarkers of this disease and its progression. To do so, we will
further characterize the metabolome of AMD. This will be achieved by: 1) performing tissue metabolomics in
donor eyes with AMD and control eyes using mass spectrometry (Aim 1A), and assessing correlations
between the metabolomic profiles of AMD in tissue and biofluids (i.e. plasma and urine) (Aim 1B); 2) re-
assessing our study cohort with early and intermediate AMD, five years after the initial enrolment, with the
same protocols, to compare the metabolome of AMD-progressors versus non progressors (Aim 2); and 3)
studying the associations between genes linked with AMD risk and metabolomics profiles (Aim 3A), and
identifying new metabolite-AMD associations (Aim 3B).
 This project will provide a unique strategy to increase the current understanding of AMD pathogenesis.
By performing tissue metabolomics and studying metabolomics-gene interactions, this proposal will help in
identifying new targets for prevention and earlier intervention, thus reducing the burden of AMD. Additionally,
this work has the potential to identify biological biomarkers of AMD and disease progression at five years in
accessible biofluids, which may contribute to improved screening and risk assessment of AMD and usher in an
era of precision medicine for this blinding condition.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is an intraocular pressure (IOP) related, progressive optic neuropathy
that ultimately leads to blindness. Permanent visual field loss from POAG is a condition of public health
significance worldwide. The etiology of POAG is poorly understood and primary prevention is not possible.
Elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) is a modifiable risk factor, however, many individuals have IOP elevation
without optic nerve disease , and at least 33% of POAG cases have progressive retinal ganglion cell loss
despite IOP measurements in the normal range, a condition defined as normal-tension glaucoma (NTG).
Preventative or neuro-protective therapies for glaucoma are not yet available and little is known about the
molecular events that influence susceptibility to glaucomatous optic nerve degeneration. The overall goal of
our research is to elucidate the pathogenesis of POAG allowing for implementation of effective screening and
prevention strategies and development of novel therapies. POAG has significant heritability and recent
genome-wide association studies, including our NEIGHBORHOOD GWAS, have identified 30 POAG loci
defined by common genomic variants. However, in addition to common variants the complex POAG genetic
architecture is likely to also include contributions from rare coding variants that implicate specific genes in
disease pathogenicity, as has been discovered for other complex traits. Large-scale studies of rare coding
variation in glaucoma populations have not yet been done. The focus of this competing renewal is to
comprehensively examine the contributions of coding variation to POAG and the HTG and NTG subgroups
with a primary goal of identifying novel therapeutic targets and specifically those with neuro-protective
potential. For the next funding period we propose the following specific aims: 1) Obtain high quality whole
exome sequence (WES) data for POAG cases and controls using state-of-the-art sequencing and robust
variant calling and annotation pipelines; 2) Assess contribution of rare coding variants to POAG and to NTG
and HTG subgroups; and 3) Build a web-based platform for data analysis, data-sharing and communication.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Project Summary. The primary auditory cortex (A1) is a central site of convergence for ascending sensory
projections and projections from diverse neuromodulatory regions. These inputs interact in A1 to both influence
moment-to-moment cortical activity and drive long-lasting changes in synaptic connections that may underlie
auditory behavioral learning. Our recent work has revealed that a diverse group of inhibitory interneurons in
cortical layer 1 (L1) has a privileged capacity to integrate tuned sensory input from the auditory thalamus and
neuromodulatory inputs from cholinergic and serotonergic brain regions. These L1 interneurons send spatially-
precise axonal projections to their postsynaptic targets that powerfully control cortical network activity and
plasticity. Our recent results suggest that two distinct classes of L1 interneurons defined by the expression of
either neuron-derived neurotrophic factor (NDNF) or vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) may receive differential
inputs and send distinct outputs to their cortical targets. We propose that each L1 interneuron class has a
specialized function in controlling cortical activity and plasticity. However, the mechanisms by which NDNF and
VIP L1 interneuron subtypes are activated and control cortical state and plasticity are not fully understood. To
address this unknown, we will use anatomical, trans-synaptic viral tracing, and electrophysiological approaches
to elucidate the pre and post-synaptic partners of NDNF and VIP L1 interneurons in mouse A1. We will also use
two-photon imaging in behaving mice to determine the in vivo activity and plasticity of NDNF and VIP L1
interneurons during auditory perceptual learning. The results of this research will identify L1 circuit mechanisms
that promote auditory plasticity in adulthood and can be exploited to advance treatments following hearing loss.

 Our ears are vulnerable to intense sounds (> 130 dB SPL) that can damage middle- and inner-ear
structures and produce temporary or permanent hearing loss. Prior research has focused on studying damage
to the cochlea, but relatively little is known of how the middle ear transmits extremely high-level damaging sounds
to the cochlea. While the middle ear muscle reflex elicited by high level steady state sounds can reduce sound
transmission to the cochlea, it cannot protect the ear during brief impulsive sounds. Nonlinear mechanisms of
the middle ear that can provide protection for impulsive sounds have been observed. However, there are few
quantitative studies of middle ear nonlinear processes, and the contributions of nonlinear mechanisms to the
frequency and level dependence of middle ear sound transfer are not well described. Furthermore, the etiologies
of middle ear structural failures produced by intense sounds are poorly known, as are their effects on middle ear
function. This lack of knowledge limits our ability to prevent such failures. There is also a lack of knowledge of
how surgically reconstructed middle ears with a passive prosthesis or graft work and their failure rate at high
level sounds. To tackle these questions, we propose three aims in this study. Aim 1 will use human cadaveric
temporal bones to systematically characterize middle ear nonlinear processes in time and frequency domains at
high intensity, in normal and reconstructed middle ears, to gain critical new knowledge on middle ear structure
and function at high sound levels. Aim 2 will extend the sound intensity to levels that can rupture the tympanic
membrane and other soft tissues to investigate the cause and time history of failures in normal and reconstructed
middle ears. For Aim 3, we propose to develop finite element middle ear nonlinear models that incorporate
multiple middle ear nonlinear mechanisms, including impulsive time-domain models and continuous tone
frequency-domain models. This study will impact our ability to predict noise-induced hearing damage,
development of new strategies for ear protection and improvements in the surgical repair of damaged middle
ears.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
Although the inner workings of the cochlea are responsible for the most fundamental aspects of hearing, including hearing
sensitivity and frequency tuning, our direct knowledge of human cochlear mechanics is limited. This lack of information
has forced researchers to rely on animal experiments to make inferences about cochlear behavior in humans, under the
assumption that the motions of the cochlear partition (CP), including the basilar membrane (BM) and the organ of Corti
(OoC), are similar between humans and laboratory animals. However, we have recently found surprising differences in
human CP anatomy and motion as compared to laboratory animals. The BM in animals is attached to a narrow fixed bony
structure, the osseous spiral lamina (OSL), and accounts for almost all of the CP motion. In contrast, the OSL in humans
is much wider, is mobile, and connects to the BM via a newly identified soft-tissue structure that we have named the CP
“bridge”. The bridge, which is non-existent in laboratory animals, is as wide as and vibrates as much as the BM.
Combined with the fact that the OSL itself is mobile, the BM therefore only accounts for a fraction of total CP motion in
humans. These newly discovered aspects of human CP anatomy and motion challenge the long-held assumption that
cochlear mechanics can be regarded as similar across mammals.
 Because CP structures such as the OSL, bridge, and location where the tectorial membrane (TM) attaches to the
limbus are all mobile in humans but not in laboratory animals, we hypothesize that the motions of the OoC structures,
including the reticular lamina and TM, are different in humans, thereby altering the input driving the transduction process
at the hair bundles of the inner and outer hair cells. To test this, Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) will allow us to
determine the anatomy and relative motion of various CP structures in situ in very fresh human cadaveric specimens. We
will also investigate and elucidate the relationships between mechanics and anatomy in the human CP using a variety of
techniques to characterize the morphometry, structural architecture, and material composition of the CP.
 We will further test our hypothesis by developing finite-element models of the human cochlea that incorporate the
measured anatomy and CP mechanics. As our measurements are from postmortem ears, they cannot reveal the effects of
active processes. However, our models can approximate active behavior based on live-animal results, which are predicted
to be functionally similar to human given the similar anatomies of these structures. The resulting models will be tested
and validated against known human tuning capabilities from psychoacoustic data, opening the door to future applications
in which human cochlear pathologies, manipulations, and treatments can be simulated with unprecedented fidelity.
 This research will greatly advance our understanding of how the structures of the human CP work together to define
the inputs to the transducers formed by the hair cells. It will also enable us to better understand the applicability and
limitations of animal experiments in the study of human hearing, and to better utilize animal models for scientific inquiry.
Moreover, the proposed computational models will be valuable both for scientific investigation of hearing phenomena and
for future improvements in the understanding, diagnosis and treatment of hearing disease.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Project Summary - Abstract
 The cochlear synapses of auditory nerve fibers (ANFs) degenerate before the sensory cells in both noise-
induced and age-related hearing loss, leaving may inner hair cells (IHCs) partially disconnected from the brain.
Although this synaptopathy has minimal effects on threshold sensitivity, it compromises hearing performance
on complex auditory tasks and may be a major risk factor for tinnitus and hyperacusis. We have shown, in
mouse, that augmenting cochlear levels of neurotrophin-3 (NT3) by local delivery, or by transgenic or virally
driven overexpression, can rescue IHC synapses after noise and prevent their loss in the aging ear. We have
also shown that post-noise IHC synapse regeneration occurs spontaneously in guinea pig, but not the mouse.
Here, we combine the resources of the Liberman and Corfas laboratories to apply a range of ultrastructural,
neurophysiological and molecular techniques to further probe the mechanisms and dynamics of synaptopathy,
characterize its functional effects, validate the minimally invasive tests used to assess it in humans, probe the
role of NT3 signaling as the key determinant of synaptopathy, and further refine translational approaches to
reverse and/or prevent synaptopathy after noise or in aging.
 Specifically, in Aim 1, we use FIB-SEM and machine learning to automate serial-section ultrastructural
analysis of the post-exposure damage and recovery of the IHC afferent innervation in mature mice vs. guinea
pigs, to shed light on the reasons for the profound differences in regenerative capacity in the two species. In
Aim 2, we combine population studies of single ANFs with intracellular labeling in synaptopathic guinea pigs at
various stages of post-exposure recovery to a) characterize the extent to which the recovered synaptic counts
reflect recovered function and b) to understand the contributions of different fiber populations to the non-
invasive metrics of ANF function used in human studies of synaptopathy. In Aim 3, we test the hypothesized
pivotal role of NT3 in the development and rescue of age- and noise-induced synaptopathy by a) determining if
NT3 expression levels are upregulated by noise in guinea pigs but not in mice, and b) if drug-mediated
blockade of cochlear NT3 receptors prevents the spontaneous post-exposure recovery of synapses in guinea
pig. In Aim 4, we continue our refinement of gene-therapy approaches to the treatment of synaptopathy using
an IHC-specific promoter in an AAV viral capsid to drive prolonged NT3 overexpression a) after noise and b) in
an aging mouse model. Together these Aims will deepen our understanding of, and treatments for, this major
contributor to the impairments of sensorineural hearing loss.

The goal of the Harvard-wide Program on Antibiotic Resistance is to apply innovative advanced
technologies to developing new strategies for treating leading causes of multidrug resistant
hospital-associated infection caused by staphylococci and enterococci. Although much attention
has appropriately been focused on the recent emergence of pan-resistant gram negative bacteria,
staphylococci and enterococci remain the leading causes of both morbidity and mortality
associated with infection by multidrug resistant ESKAPE pathogens, highlighting the limitation of
current therapeutic approaches. This multi-investigator project brings together experts from fields
ranging from mathematics and systems biology to infectious disease clinicians, and creates an
infrastructure for them to work collaboratively and synergistically, bringing new insights and
capabilities to bear in solving the leading public health crisis of antibiotic resistant infection.
Important discoveries and advances were made in the previous period of support by pressing the
envelope with new technologies, including the most advanced high throughput mutational and
comparative genomic analyses yet conducted on these microbes. In the proposed continuation
period, these technologies will be combined with the latest advances in microfluidics and single
cell time lapse imaging, to reveal new vulnerabilities of these bacteria for targeting by new
compounds. The development and use of innovative screens that de-risk targets as well as unveil
new opportunities, inform the design of new and more efficacious compounds for treating
multidrug resistant staphylococcal and enterococcal infection. Filling critical knowledge gaps
related to the various mechanisms by which microbes survive antibiotic challenge, including
stochastic entry into alternate growth states and actively reducing drug concentration through
efflux, make this program exceptionally comprehensive in its approach. Finally, this project
actively shares its results with the community by establishing and promoting information exchange
and networking with other academic and industry scientists, and by ensuring important antibiotic
discovery knowledge is preserved and transmitted to the next generation of scientists. As a result
of internal and external synergies, the impact of the Harvard-wide Program on Antibiotic
Resistance is much greater than would otherwise be possible through individual research efforts.

 Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is a major global public health issue. Following mTBI, individuals commonly
report difficulties with hearing quality, tinnitus, hyperacusis, and speech-in-noise intelligibility. In order to
understand why patients experience auditory dysfunction after mTBI, new approaches are needed that combine
quantitative non-invasive biomarkers in mTBI patients with studies of the underlying neurophysiological and
anatomical changes. The overarching hypothesis of the proposal is that many of the neurosensory disorders
associated with mTBI share a common root related to a disruption of low-level sensory feature coding. Of all the
sensory systems, the auditory system places the highest demand on rapid, high-fidelity temporal coding. We
therefore propose that abnormal temporal processing and central gain in the auditory system of mTBI patients
and animal models would highlight a neural signature of the auditory behavioral sequalae and may serve as the
“canary in the coal mine” for distributed pathophysiology occurring more generally in other brain systems. Thus,
the Candidate proposes a mentored training plan to develop non-invasive biomarkers of auditory dysfunction in
mTBI subjects and to identify the neurobiological substrates for these deficits in a mouse model of mTBI.
 The Candidate has assembled a mentorship team that has expertise in a range of relevant areas for the
proposal, including psychophysics in human subjects, mTBI mouse models, neurophysiological measures of
auditory temporal processing and central gain, and quantitative cochlear histopathology. By integrating
complementary levels of analysis through the study of different species it will be possible to generate greater
insight into the pathophysiology of mTBI. In Aim 1, the Candidate will use a combination of auditory
psychophysical tests and measures of the electroencephalography (EEG) frequency following response to test
the hypothesis that mTBI subjects show deficits in coding rapid temporal cues and hyperactivity in sound intensity
coding relative to controls. In Aim 2, the Candidate will incorporate a mouse mTBI model to compare EEG
recordings against extracellular recordings of local field potentials and single unit spiking from the inferior
colliculus (IC) and auditory cortex (ACtx) to test whether: 1) mice exhibit a similar auditory temporal processing
and central gain phenotype observed in human subjects, and 2) abnormal temporal processing and coding of
sound intensity are more prevalent in the IC or ACtx. In Aim 3, the Candidate will examine sensory and neural
pathology in the cochlea of mice that have undergone mTBI, as well as transcriptional changes in Gria2 and
Gabra1 mRNA levels in the IC and ACtx. These studies in Aim 3 will address the hypothesis that dysregulation
of auditory temporal processing and central gain are linked to cochlear afferent neuropathy and imbalanced
markers of excitatory and inhibitory signaling in the central auditory pathway. The K08 award will be a crucial
stepping-stone toward the goal of developing into an independent clinician-scientist.

The 2024, 2026, and 2028 meetings of the International Hearing Aid Research
Conference (IHCON) will be the 17th, 18th, and 19th times that this biennial research
conference is held. The purpose of IHCON has been and will continue to be to advance
knowledge and facilitate progress in research and development related to the treatment
of hearing impairment with hearing aids, through the exchange of current research findings
and technical advancements. A hallmark of past IHCON meetings has been their ability to
draw together the disciplines and specialties essential to the advancement of hearing-aid
research taking place within the US and abroad. A primary goal of each IHCON meeting
is to build upon the strengths of the previous meetings and to showcase the current and
emerging multidisciplinary research areas that will best meet the needs of the hearing-aid
community in the coming years, while also increasing participation from underrepresented
groups (URGs). New in 2024, a Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) Chair has been
appointed to facilitate the recruitment of participants from URGs, including Blacks,
Hispanics, Native Americans, and women. The International Hearing Aid Seminar (IHAS)
will continue to be held immediately before the main IHCON meeting, which will encourage,
train, and mentor students entering the hearing-aid research and development field.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：The NIH Precision Medicine Initiative was launched in 2015 with the goal of improving disease treatment and
prevention based on understanding of genes, environment, and lifestyle. As a first step towards this goal,
genome-wide association studies (GWAS), funded in part by the NIH, have identified 127 genes associated
with risk for developing primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) across multiple ancestries. However, this has
not yet translated into personalized approaches for disease diagnosis, risk stratification, monitoring or
treatment of this common, blinding disease. This proposal describes a 5-year training program for a clinician-
scientist to develop a career focused on leveraging understanding of the genetic basis of glaucoma to optimize
clinical care for afflicted individuals. I am well-suited to tackle this important unmet need. I have a strong
research background in glaucoma genetics and continued this work under the mentorship of Dr. Janey Wiggs
during my glaucoma fellowship at Mass. Eye and Ear. Our preliminary data demonstrate that POAG patients
with high mitochondrial genetic risk scores have higher mean treated intraocular pressure (IOP) and markedly
increased prevalence of paracentral field loss compared to patients with low mitochondrial genetic risk. These
results suggest that POAG driven by mitochondrial risk variants may represent a distinct disease subtype with
specific clinical features. However, the underlying molecular mechanism is unknown and deep clinical
phenotyping is also warranted. In Aim 1, we will investigate the extent that individuals with high mitochondrial
pathway-specific polygenic risk scores (PRSs) display elevated IOP, retinal mitochondrial dysfunction, distinct
visual field loss patterns on archetypal analysis and greater susceptibility to environmental toxins that impact
mitochondrial function. In Aim 2, we will characterize the functional impact of mitochondrial gene variants using
disease-relevant primary cell strains (trabecular meshwork cells and retinal ganglion cells from human donor
eyes) and ex vivo perfusions. The proposed work is geared to lay the groundwork for tailored approaches to
disease monitoring and treatment for the subset of glaucoma driven by high mitochondrial genetic risk.
Importantly, the research aims and proposed career development plan will provide me with new skills in
statistical genetics and bioinformatics, clinical study design, deep clinical phenotyping, and functional
assessment of conventional outflow cells and retinal ganglion cells. I will have access to all resources
necessary to carry out the proposed work through Mass. Eye and Ear and the greater Harvard community. I
am fortunate to have an outstanding team of mentors with expertise in glaucoma genetics (Drs. Janey Wiggs,
Louis Pasquale, Ayellet Segre, and Jae Hee Kang), clinical data science (Dr. Tobias Elze), mitochondrial
function (Dr. James Handa), conventional aqueous outflow pathobiology (Dr. Daniel Stamer) and retinal
ganglion cell function (Dr. Donald Zack). Importantly, all members of my mentorship team are committed to my
career development and facilitating my transition to an independent, R01-funded clinician-scientist investigator.

Antiretroviral therapy (ART) has improved the lives of people living with HIV (PWH). However, the increased
burden of HIV-associated non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and
obesity is leading to higher morbidity and mortality among these individuals. The disruption of the intestinal
barrier, resulting in microbial translocation and chronic systemic inflammation, has been linked to NCDs.
However, the mechanism of intestinal barrier disruption in PWH on ART remains incompletely understood.
Interactions between tissue resident CD8+ T cells and the intestinal epithelium are critical for maintaining barrier
integrity. Colonic CD8+ T cells are dependent upon on lipid metabolism for energy production and PPARs
(peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors) are a family of lipid-sensing receptors that critically regulate lipid
metabolism in colon CD8+ T cells. Increases in PPAR-induced lipid metabolism have previously been shown to
boost CD8+ T cell immune function in the tumor microenvironment and improve colitis in patients with
inflammatory bowel disease. In PWH on ART, we show that PPARs are downregulated in colon CD8+ T cells,
which results in impaired internal lipid storage. Moreover, PPAR deficiency in these cells is also associated with
CD8+ T cell-mediated epithelial damage that disrupts intestinal barrier integrity. This has led us to hypothesize
that in PWH on ART, downregulation of PPARs result in impaired lipid metabolism in colonic CD8+ T cells, which
decrease effector functions and leads to impaired intestinal barrier integrity. During the K99 phase, this proposal
aims to determine the effects of PPARs on CD8+ T cell effector function in PWH on ART. In Aim 1 we will use
PPAR knock-out mice to determine the role of PPAR signaling in the CD8+ T cell subpopulations in the mouse
colon (K99 phase). Aim 2 we will characterize the mechanism of how PPAR signaling impacts lipid metabolism
in colonic CD8+ T cells (K99 to R00 transition). In Aim 3, we will determine how dysregulation of cellular
metabolism in colonic CD8+ T cells impacts epithelial function in the intestine (R00 phase). This proposal will
involve using ex vivo intestinal organoids that incorporate colonic CD8+ T cells from human subjects and
genetically engineered mice with deficiencies in CD8+ T cell cellular energy production. To carry out these aims,
the PI has assembled a team with combined expertise in HIV pathogenesis, mucosal immunology,
immunometabolism, intestinal pathology, and single-cell transcriptomics who will collaborate and support the
PI’s work and career development. This proposal seeks to identify novel therapeutic interventions that can
restore tissue-resident CD8+ T cell function in PWH on ART (K99) and characterize the molecular mechanism
of intestinal barrier damage associated with chronic immune activation to help ameliorate NCDs in ART-treated
PWH (R00).

Tumor immune exclusion predicts poor anticancer therapeutic responses and patient outcomes. The mechanical
barrier built by intercellular junction connections and extracellular matrix maintains immune exclusion in immune-
privileged organs. How such barriers dictate immune infiltration in cancer remains largely unknown. My prior
training and career goals are focused on the unmet need to comprehensively understand what mechanical
barriers are utilized by tumors, how they instigate immune exclusion to evade immune surveillance, and how to
rationally design innovative therapies that break down mechanical barriers and unleash the full potential of
antitumor immunity. Since joining the Ellisen Lab at Massachusetts General Hospital/Harvard Medical School, I
have focused my mechanical barrier studies on the tight junction related molecule TROP2, which is
overexpressed and thought to play a role in progression of multiple cancers including aggressive triple negative
breast cancer (TNBC). Like its paralog EPCAM, TROP2 is one of a set of mechanical barrier molecules linked
to lack of tumor infiltrating immune cells. Additionally, my preliminary bioinformatic analysis shows that TROP2
has a significant negative correlation with key antitumor immune markers in multiple breast cancer cohorts. Thus,
I hypothesized that TROP2 may enforce a mechanical barrier to deter antitumor immune infiltration in breast
cancer. Importantly, TROP2 is the target protein of multiple recently developed antibody drug conjugates (ADCs)
including Sacituzumab Govitecan (SG). SG, the first FDA approved ADC for TNBC, combines a TROP2-targeted
antibody with a topoisomerase 1 (TOP1) inhibitor as cytotoxic payload. While SG is proving to be a highly
successful precision therapy, its mechanisms remain poorly understood. Furthermore, the cytotoxic payload of
SG is a TOP1 inhibitor, a class of drugs known to elicit immunogenic cell death, thus providing a strong rationale
to understand mechanisms by which targeting TROP2 alone and in the context of SG will modulate tumor
immune microenvironment, thus sensitizing tumors to immune checkpoint inhibitors. This proposal will employ
biochemistry, mouse tumor models, genetic screens, as well as multi-omics and spatial imaging analysis of
patient specimens. The study aims to dissect the mechanism of TROP2-mediated immune exclusion in TNBC
(Aim 1); discover mechanisms of the SG/anti-PD1 combination (Aim 2), and systematically uncover novel
instigators of breast tumor immune exclusion (Aim 3). My extensive background in breast cancer immune
microenvironment and the interdisciplinary expertise of my mentor/advisors/collaborator team make me well-
suited to carry out this innovative proposal to systematically unravel tumor-intrinsic mechanisms of immune
exclusion. Together with the institutional support from Massachusetts General Hospital/Harvard Medical School,
this award will help me gain additional knowledge and training in the area of tumor models, spatial multi-omics
analysis, and CRISPR screens, as well as career development skills which will ultimately help me to rapidly
transition to a fruitful and impactful independent research career.

Recurrence from early-stage (stage I/II) primary melanomas, often undetected until symptomatic metastasis,
accounts for most melanoma mortality. Current prognostic tools are inadequate to identify patients at high risk
of recurrence and metastasis at the time of diagnosis, limiting the ability to provide improved surveillance and
personalized treatment. Additionally, biological mechanisms driving early-stage melanoma recurrence remain
understudied, as previous studies have extensively focused on advanced melanomas. I hypothesize that the
states, interactions, and spatial relationships of cells within the melanoma microenvironment, as well as
transcriptomic signatures, play a critical role in early-stage melanoma recurrence and can further inform
predictive models. To test this hypothesis, I propose to leverage recent advances in multiplexed tissue imaging,
spatial transcriptomics, and artificial intelligence to robustly quantify known prognostic factors, discover new
biomarkers, and develop explainable machine-learning models for predicting early-stage melanoma recurrence.
The integration of clinical, histopathologic, and multiplexed imaging single-cell data will facilitate the development
of accurate and reliable prognostic tools, which can be deployed in clinical settings following independent
validation. In Aim 1 (K99), I will develop computational approaches to identify and quantify both known prognostic
features and novel biomarkers through multi-modal analyses of multiplexed imaging and spatial transcriptomic
data. In Aim 2 (K99), using an efficient multi-modal imaging method, I will generate multiplexed and conventional
histopathologic hematoxylin and eosin-stained images of the same tissue section for a large cohort and integrate
them with electronic health records to build interpretable machine-learning models for predicting melanoma
recurrence. In Aim 3 (R00), I will validate the machine learning models in an independent cohort and apply the
pipeline for stage III melanoma recurrence and other cancer settings. My Ph.D. in computer science and ongoing
postdoctoral training in computational biology, genomics, and biomedical informatics put me in a unique position
to accomplish this proposed research. During the K99 phase, I will be supported by an outstanding and
interdisciplinary team of mentors, advisors, and collaborators (Dr. Semenov, Dr. Sorger. Dr. Yu, Dr. Shalek, Dr.
Tsao, Dr. Lian, and Dr. Nemeth) with expertise in all aspects of the proposed research. I will acquire new
knowledge and skills in (a) cancer biology and immunology and (b) computational analyses in multiplexed tissue
imaging and spatial transcriptomics. Together with formal coursework, professional training, and institutional
support from the Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, I will bridge my knowledge gap
in computational cancer biology, professional skills, and leadership vital to transition into an independent position
and establish a highly impactful laboratory, focusing on the development of computational methodologies to
systematically decipher mechanisms of cancer development and progression.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Background: South Africa (SA) has a generalized HIV epidemic, and the highest HIV prevalence rate (19%).
Psychosocial (e.g., depression, post-traumatic stress) and structural problems (e.g., food insecurity) are
associated with worse antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence and higher viral load. Depression, post-traumatic
stress, and food insecurity are also highly comorbid and are thought to interact synergistically to confer greater
risk for worse HIV outcomes (i.e., syndemic problems). The goal of this proposal is to obtain the necessary
training and support needed to develop and test a multilevel intervention to address syndemic problems and
improve ART adherence (CBT-SA). Candidate: I am a clinical psychologist with specialized training in
behavioral medicine and quantitative psychology, and currently a post-doctoral fellow at Massachusetts General
Hospital and Harvard Medical School. This 5-year career development award will provide the mentorship,
training, and experience needed to become an NIH-funded independent investigator studying the effects of
syndemic problems on HIV and developing and testing interventions to address these syndemic effects in
resource-limited settings globally. Mentoring: Dr. Conall O’Cleirigh will serve as my primary US-based mentor
given his expertise in trauma, depression and HIV in resource-limited settings. Dr. John Joska will be my primary
SA-based mentor due to his experience with the presentation of depression and trauma, and developing
interventions in SA. My co-mentors will be Dr. Christina Psaros given her expertise in conducting qualitative
research and Dr. Jessica Magidson because of her experience in implementation science. My Scientific Advisory
Board is comprised of experts from SA and the US: Dr. Ashraf Kagee (intersection of structural and psychosocial
problems), Dr. Steven Safren (intervention development), and Dr. Daniel Feaster (biostatistics), with consultation
from Dr. Julian May (addressing food insecurity) and Dr. Lenny Naidoo (government). Training: I propose to
obtain training in qualitative methods for conceptual framework development and intervention evaluation,
intervention development and the NIH Stage Model, and implementation science theory and frameworks. These
training goals will provide the necessary knowledge to develop, test, and eventually implement interventions to
address syndemic problems and HIV treatment outcomes. Research: The proposed specific aims are to: 1)
explore the complex interrelationships between food insecurity, depression, and post-traumatic stress, as they
relate to engagement in HIV care, and explore attitudes to potential intervention components; 2) develop a
multilevel intervention to address syndemic problems and improve adherence (CBT-SA) and conduct an iterative
proof-of-concept pilot trial use syndemic theory; 3a) assess the feasibility and acceptability of CBT-SA in a pilot
RCT; and 3b) identify barriers and facilitators of CBT-SA engagement among PWH and uptake among care
providers and other key local partners to inform a future hybrid effectiveness/implementation R01 trial. If
successful, this intervention would be further tested for effectiveness and implementation in a future application.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Cognitive dysfunction is a highly prevalent feature of depression that is resistant to anti-depressant treatments
and associated with a worse course and outcome. Although a broad range of cognitive deficits are observed in
depression, it is psychomotor speed and executive function that are most severely impacted during a
depressive episode. A mechanistic understanding of why cognitive deficits emerge in depression is needed to
identify treatment targets. Activated inflammatory physiology - a process in which TNF signaling is critical -
plays a causal role in a substantial proportion of depressed cases based on genetic, clinical, experimental and
observational research. In contrast, evidence that inflammation causes cognitive dysfunction, particularly in the
context of depression, is less clearly established. Both theory and observational data, however, indicate that
inflammation may account for deficits in psychomotor speed and executive function during a depressive
episode. Determining how inflammation relates to cognitive dysfunction in depression is complicated by
notable methodological limitations. First, the nature of the associations between inflammation, depression, and
cognition is difficult to characterize because multiple, overlapping confounds exist (e.g., stress). Second,
cognition is typically assessed intermittently (months/years apart) due to a reliance on in-person, lengthy
cognitive measures that lack (“real-time”) temporal sensitivity. To overcome these limitations, this K23
application proposes using an intensive sampling methodology within a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to
determine whether administration of an anti-inflammatory agent that inhibits tumor necrosis factor (TNF)
signaling improves psychomotor speed and executive function in depressed individuals exhibiting an
inflammatory phenotype over two weeks; exploratory analyses will examine whether decreases in inflammatory
biomarkers are associated with improvements in cognition. Advances in cognitive neuroscience will be
leveraged to assess cognition daily and generate sophisticated estimates of cognitive performance that
address known limitations in conventional indices. A TNF antagonist was selected because of its critical role in
inflammation, known association with psychomotor speed and executive function and because clinical trials
have shown that a TNF antagonist (infliximab) can reduce depressive symptoms and increase effortful
motivation after two weeks in depressed individuals exhibiting an inflammatory phenotype. The applicant
proposes training in the: conduct of experiment research that is well-equipped to determine causality (i.e.
RCT); use of intensive sampling methodologies in clinical samples; use of remote cognitive assessment tools
and sophisticated analytic approaches; and further training in immunology. An interdisciplinary team of
scientists will provide expert mentorship within the highly resourced environment of the Massachusetts General
Hospital. The proposed study will advance the candidate’s long-term career goal of developing a mechanistic
understanding of cognitive dysfunction in depression and accelerate the transition to research independence.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
People experiencing homelessness (PEH) are disproportionately affected by the opioid overdose crisis, with
overdose rates up to 30-times higher than the general population. Medications for opioid use disorder (OUD)
substantially reduce mortality, but retention in treatment remains low. Identifying strategies to improve OUD
treatment retention in this population is crucial to enhancing recovery opportunities and reducing mortality.
Peer recovery support has shown promise in improving OUD treatment outcomes in the general population,
but research studying its effects has been limited by a lack of attention to vulnerable populations (e.g., PEH),
heterogeneity in the services provided, and lack of methodologic rigor in study design. This award addresses
all of these gaps and will advance the science of peer recovery support for the treatment of OUD among PEH.
Using a community-engaged framework and a mixed methods design, the investigators will (1) develop a peer
recovery support intervention to promote OUD treatment retention tailored to PEH by incorporating qualitative
findings from patient focus groups and national Health Care for the Homeless program key stakeholder
interviews into a consensus building Delphi process, and (2) pilot test the feasibility, acceptability, and fidelity
of the peer recovery support intervention to promote OUD treatment retention among PEH. The proposed
research complements the National Institute on Drug Abuse’s (NIDA’s) 2022-2026 strategic plan by addressing
two priority areas: advancing the science of recovery support and conducting research in real-world clinical
settings. This proposal also supports several cross-cutting priorities at NIDA: promoting collaboration with
community stakeholders, incorporating patient perspectives into intervention development, and reducing health
disparities. The principal investigator’s (PI’s) long-term career goal is to become an independent physician-
investigator with expertise in designing and testing interventions to improve the health and health care of
marginalized individuals with substance use disorders. Though the PI has a strong research foundation in
epidemiologic and health services research methods, she will need additional training in (1) community-
engaged research with populations disadvantaged by social determinants of health, (2) mixed methods
research, and (3) design and conduct of interventional clinical trials in real-world settings to successfully carry
out this proposal and achieve her long-term goals. To accomplish these training objectives and her proposed
research plan, the PI assembled an exceptional team of mentors, developed a comprehensive training plan,
and will leverage the research expertise and infrastructure at Massachusetts General Hospital, the educational
expertise of Harvard Medical School, and the clinical infrastructure and homelessness expertise of Boston
Health Care for the Homeless Program. The successful completion of the proposed research will position the
PI to submit an NIH R01 application to conduct a full-scale trial of a peer recovery support intervention to
promote OUD treatment retention among PEH and facilitate her goal of becoming an independent investigator.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
This career development award proposal describes a research and training plan that will provide Dr. Katherine
McDermott with the resources needed to establish a career as an independent clinical scientist developing and
testing scalable interventions for the treatment of chronic pain. Background: Chronic musculoskeletal pain is
one of the leading causes of disability, with millions of individuals suffering from its effects. Pain catastrophizing
is a key predictor of pain interference and is characterized by magnification of the intensity of pain, rumination,
and feelings of helplessness to cope. While some interventions target pain catastrophizing, they offer modest
effects and require extensive resources due to reliance on clinician involvement. Self-directed interventions that
parsimoniously and effectively target pain catastrophizing are needed. Specific aims and research design: This
project will involve the development, refinement, and preliminary evaluation of Pain Disengagement Training
(PDT), a self-directed intervention for pain catastrophizing. The aims of this project are 1) To develop PDT using
qualitative focus groups to solicit patient input on intervention components and protocol considerations (N=4
groups, ~20 participants); 2) To refine PDT using an open pilot (N=10) with pre/post intervention self-report
assessments and qualitative exit interviews to obtain feedback on the intervention experience and procedures; and
3) To evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and credibility of PDT in a pilot randomized controlled trial (N=50)
of PDT vs. Healthy Writing Control (HWC). Results will inform a multi-site feasibility RCT R01 submission.
Training and mentoring: Three primary training aims will be accomplished in the present proposal to fill key
gaps in the candidate’s training: 1) Qualitative and mixed methods, including the design of focus group procedures
and qualitative and mixed methods data analysis; 2) Chronic pain intervention development and refinement,
including developing protocols to optimize intervention acceptability and feasibility in a pain patient sample; and
3) Management of rigorous randomized clinical trials, including establishing standard operating procedures to
maximize fidelity and retention. This training will be provided by a team of expert mentors including Dr. Ana-
Maria Vranceanu, Dr. Francis Keefe, and Dr. Mark Lumley, who have a wealth of experience designing and
evaluating interventions for chronic pain. Additional training will be provided by advisors (Drs. Parker and
Yousif), didactics, scientific publications, and experiential training, including manuscript writing. Relevance to
NCCIH: This study is well-aligned with NCCIH’s focus on Whole Health research and support of impactful
clinical trials of complementary and integrative health approaches, including the advancement of the
complementary and integrative management of pain. Impact: The proposed project and training plan will provide
the candidate with the training needed to transition to independence as an intervention researcher committed to
creating scalable treatments to address the key predictors of chronic pain interference.

This K23 proposal will investigate the timing of the relationship between vascular risk and amyloid (Aβ) on
tau accumulation during the preclinical stages of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), to determine the critical window
for intervention. Our prior studies demonstrated a synergy between specific vascular risks, especially high
systolic blood pressure (SBP) and body mass index (BMI), with Aβ in accelerating tau PET burden and
cognitive decline in preclinical AD. The prevalence and modifiability of hypertension and obesity add to their
excellent potential as combination therapeutic targets with Aβ for prevention efforts in AD. However, the
optimal age group to target for intervention remains unknown. Epidemiology studies suggest that midlife
vascular risks are most strongly associated with increased risk of AD, while effects are mixed or reversed in
late-life. The goal of this project is to address the following key knowledge gaps: 1) how early and over what
age period do elevated SBP and BMI, synergistically with Aβ accumulation, drive greater tau pathology, 2)
whether plasma phosphorylated tau (p-tau) measures may be more sensitive than tau PET in detecting an
early interaction in midlife when the AD pathological burden is low, and 3) how longitudinal changes of these
tau measures relate to the synergistic effects of vascular risk and Aβ on prospective cognitive decline. We
will accomplish these goals using an innovative approach: i) harmonizing the breadth of cross-sectional data
from the Harvard Aging Brain Study (HABS) and Framingham Heart Study across 5+ decades from mid- to
late-life to determine the timing of the vascular-Aβ effects on tau PET (Aim 1) and plasma p-tau (Aim 2), and
ii) leveraging the depth of longitudinal characterization in HABS to elucidate the effects on longitudinal tau
pathology, and determine how changes in tau PET and p-tau relate to cognitive decline (Aim 3). Our findings
will inform the design of combination clinical trials targeting vascular risk and Aβ in preclinical AD, by
identifying the population at risk and by establishing whether plasma p-tau can detect this early synergy,
which can greatly expand accessibility and diversity of research studies. Our preliminary results suggest
that the synergistic effects on tau pathology are greatest during midlife, which has the potential to shift
research and clinical practice paradigms to focus prevention efforts even earlier. This career development
award will be powered by a cohesive mentorship and advisory team of leading experts with complementary
expertise in AD and vascular contribution to cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID). The rigorous training
plan will enable the candidate – a practicing cognitive neurologist with a strong commitment to AD research,
to acquire new expertise in PET methodologies, plasma biomarkers, epidemiology and mechanisms of
VCID, and advanced statistical methods including clinical trials design. The scientific knowledge and
research skills gained from this K23 award will advance the candidate towards an independent clinician-
scientist career to identify, understand, and ultimately intervene on vascular contributions to preclinical AD.

The objective of this application is to develop the career of Dr. Breyne, facilitating his transition to a stable,
independent phase and establishing his research program. He will pursue a rigorous career development plan
to further his training in (i) extracellular vesicle (EV) biology, (ii) immune-oncology, and (iii) professional
development. Progress in these domains will be accomplished through coursework, attendance and speaking at
conferences and workshops, writing last author papers, mentoring others, and leading team efforts. The training
environment is exceptional, and the collaborators are world-class. The K22 Award will give the PI protected time
to generate data for an R01 proposal while launching his independent faculty position.
Once glioblastoma (GB) progresses after first-line therapy, treatment options are limited, and managing recurrent
GB remains challenging. While newly diagnosed GB patients have a life expectancy of ~15 months, it is reduced
to 6 to 9 months after relapse. Recently, localized delivery of interleukin-12 (IL12) has had promising anti-tumoral
effects in patients with high-grade, recurrent GB extending the survival to ~17 months. Our preliminary data show
that intratumoral IL12, together with local expression of a costimulatory factor for cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs)
- 4-1BBL, can induce sustained anti-glioma responses. The objective of our studies is to develop a clinically
relevant strategy combining these factors while expanding our understanding of immune-suppressive resistance
against IL12-induced anti-glioma activity. In Aim 1, we will establish disruptive technology presenting
combinations of immuno-modulatory factors on a single nanocarrier. In essence, dendritic cell (DC)-derived EVs
will be designed to display IL12, 4-1BBL, and a neoantigen:MHC complex. In line with our findings of GB-treated
mice with IL12/4-1BBL combo- compared to IL12 monotherapy, we anticipate that immunotherapeutic EVs will
translate to ~68% improvement in the survival of GB-bearing mice. In Aim 2, the resistance mechanisms induced
by GB against IL12 treatment will be explored. We have observed that myeloid cell subsets sense antitumor
immunity activated by IL12. By combining single-cell RNA sequencing analysis with multiparametric flow
cytometry in IL12-treated GB mouse models, we will uncover the pro-oncogenic signaling resulting in a PD-L1
increase and 4-1BBL decrease. In turn, these targets will be monitored in response to intratumoral EV treatment
anticipating the attenuation of GB resistance. Aim 3 will investigate CTL:DC crosstalk driving IL12 treatment.
CTLs are responsible for IL12-induced anti-glioma activity, as shown by our CD8 depletion experiments.
However, little is known about DCs in an IL12-stimulated GB brain. Transgenic mouse models will aid us by
marking or depleting relevant DCs in the tumor and studying the anti-tumor activity of our engineered EVs.
This unique proposal addresses a crucial and timely unmet need in the field. We plan to engage the therapeutic
potential of EVs to arrest GB progression. This work will undoubtedly provide a strong foundation for the
candidate's independent leadership in brain tumor research.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Project Summary/Abstract: Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), a small vessel disease characterized by the
deposition of amyloid-β in the walls of cortical and leptomeningeal blood vessels of the brain, is a leading cause
of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) in the elderly. Patients with CAA present clinically with hemorrhagic lesions,
including acute symptomatic lobar ICH, convexal subarachnoid hemorrhage (cSAH), and the chronic
manifestation of cSAH, cortical superficial siderosis (cSS). There are currently no effective treatments for
hemorrhage prevention in CAA, in part due to limitations in our understanding of the mechanisms leading to
vessel rupture and hemorrhage. Recent studies suggest that leptomeningeal bleeding is an important risk factor
in the development of lobar ICH. The proposed research focuses on the central hypothesis that severe
leptomeningeal CAA and leptomeningeal bleeding (including cSAH and cSS) cause CAA-related lobar
ICH. The applicant will use a multimodal approach including ex vivo MRI-targeted neuropathological examination
of human brain tissue and complementary in vivo imaging of mouse models of CAA. Inflammatory-mediated
leptomeningeal vascular remodeling will be explored as a putative cause of leptomeningeal bleeding and
potentially lobar ICH. Additionally, the consequences of leptomeningeal bleeding for the underlying cortex and
cortical vasculature will be investigated. Inflammation secondary to blood products is hypothesized to be a crucial
mechanistic link between initial leptomeningeal bleeding and rupture of additional blood vessels leading to ICH.
This hypothesis will be explored in human brain tissue and in two complementary animal models of cSAH/cSS
developed by the applicant. Importantly, patients with CAA typically present to clinical attention when the
underlying vessel pathology has significantly progressed, and bleeding events have begun to occur. The
overarching goal of these studies is to identify novel, and urgently needed, treatment targets for
hemorrhage prevention, accessible at the time of symptomatic patient presentation.
 The proposed experiments and career development plan build on the applicant’s strong background in
in vivo optical imaging of rodent models, with the career development plan focused on expanding the applicant’s
knowledge base in advanced neuropathology and neuroinflammation through experimental training, formal
coursework, conferences, and mentorship. The excellent scientific environment and resources of Massachusetts
General Hospital and Harvard Medical School as well as the applicant’s outstanding mentorship team (including
mentor, co-mentor, and scientific advisory board) of internationally recognized leaders in the fields of CAA,
ICH/SAH, in vivo optical imaging, neuropathology, and neuroinflammation, will be critical to the applicant’s career
development and completion of the proposed work. This K08 award will be instrumental in the applicant’s
progression to a successful independent career as a clinician-scientist focused on ICH.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Externalizing disorders are highly heritable psychiatric conditions that typically present in childhood or
adolescence and co-occur within individuals. Recent genome-wide association studies have successfully
identified hundreds of genetic loci linked to externalizing disorders – many of which are known to be involved
in neurodevelopment. Bioinformatic results have bolstered this connection, revealing that the shared genetic
architecture of externalizing is enriched for genes that are preferentially expressed during the prenatal period.
However, despite these important advances, our understanding of the precise neurodevelopmental
mechanisms involved remains limited. Identifying the specific processes that augment the risk for and
development of externalizing psychopathology would greatly advance translational knowledge in this domain.
In this application, Dr. Travis Mallard will investigate the central hypothesis that externalizing psychopathology
is influenced by genes involved in critical neurodevelopmental programs that partially exert their influence via
subtle-but-deleterious effects on cortical structure. Specifically, Dr. Mallard will use the Genomic Structural
Equation Modeling framework to advance genetic discovery for externalizing disorders (Aim 1), and elucidate
the genetic relationships between externalizing and brain structure across development (Aim 2). Using cutting-
edge informatic methods, he will then characterize the multidimensional functional profiles of risk genes (Aim
3). These studies will use existing large-scale neurogenomic and clinical datasets and advanced statistical
methods that the applicant and his mentorship team have pioneered. Together, these aims will help clarify the
complex molecular underpinnings and developmental neurogenomic pathways in externalizing disorders.
With his unique background in clinical psychology, complex trait genetics, and human neuroscience, Dr.
Mallard is well-qualified to execute the proposed research and training objectives. The four-year training
program will foster the applicant’s technical skillset, professional development, and progression toward
independence, and the proposed studies will generate vital preliminary data for a future R01 application with
therapeutic potential. Dr. Mallard will continue his mentee relationships with Drs. Jordan Smoller and Tian Ge,
while receiving training and mentorship in functional genomics and transcriptomics from Dr. Michael Gandal.
He has also enlisted several additional renowned clinical scientists to serve on his Expert Advisory Committee:
Dr. Danielle Dick, an expert in the genetic etiology of externalizing disorders; Dr. Elliot Tucker-Drob, a
statistical genetics and cognitive development expert; and Dr. Armin Raznahan, an expert in developmental
neuroscience and genomics. The collaborative research environment is ideal for furthering Dr. Mallard’s goal
of becoming an independent clinician-scientist in psychiatric genetics.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:
Coronary artery disease (CAD) remains the leading cause of death globally and the identification of
individuals at high risk to target early prevention strategies is a major public health need. Commonly used
clinical risk estimators are validated for limited age and ancestry groups and are poorly calibrated to
contemporary populations, limiting their utility. Polygenic scores (PGS) – which quantify inherited risk by
summing information from many common sites of DNA variation – hold considerable promise for improving
upon available clinical risk estimators, however available PGS for CAD currently lack proper actionability
due to limitations of input data, score methodology, and clinical applications. More comprehensive and
equitable tools incorporating genetic risk are needed to predict risk earlier in life to enable preventive
interventions and reduce morbidity and mortality of CAD. Dr. Patel proposes to develop more generalizable
PGS for CAD using multi-ancestry genomic data; to construct clinically interpretable, absolute CAD risk
prediction models integrating genetic and non-genetic factors; and to investigate new clinical indications for
PGS use utilizing clinical trial data. In Aim 1, Dr. Patel will develop new PGS for CAD optimized for
individuals of diverse ancestries by harnessing the principle of burrowing information from functional
genomic annotations, cross-ancestry correlation, and cross-trait correlation to refine the effect estimates of
genetic variants included in these scores. In Aim 2, Dr. Patel will integrate polygenic risk with clinical risk
factors to develop a absolute risk prediction models for CAD, which he will then calibrate, validate, and
deploy in external datasets. In Aim 3, Dr. Patel will define clinical use indications for PGS using secondary
analyses of CAD prevention clinical trials within the context of individuals with inflammatory mediators
including HIV and elevated C-reactive protein. The overall goal for this application is to advance the
actionability of PGS by addressing their limitations in equity, interpretability, and indication. Upon successful
completion of these aims, Dr. Patel expects to deliver better-performing and cross-ancestry portable CAD
PGS, share externally validated, integrated absolute risk prediction models, report utility for PGS use in
specific sub-populations for guiding therapies, and nominate inflammatory mechanisms to target in future
trials. These endpoints will collectively advance the actionability of PGS models for CAD, moving closer to
their clinical deployment for disease prevention. This research will be accomplished in the setting of a
comprehensive career development program designed to provide Dr. Patel with the skills needed to
become an independent physician-scientist in cardiovascular genomics. This proposal brings together a
unique interdisciplinary advisory team of experts in the fields of epidemiology, genomics, statistics, and
clinical trials research that will guide Dr. Patel in his transition to scientific independence.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 This proposal presents a five-year research and career development plan focused on machine learning
(ML)-guided antibiotic development for multidrug-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae. The candidate, Melis
Anahtar, MD, PhD, has completed clinical pathology training at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) and is
now a postdoctoral researcher under the mentorship of Dr. James Collins at MIT and the Broad Institute. Dr.
Collins pioneered the field of ML-based antibiotic discovery and has trained over 70 independent research
investigators. The proposed project builds on Dr. Anahtar’s previous research experiences in the vaginal
microbiome and in genomic antimicrobial resistance (AMR) determinants. AMR poses an existential threat by
rendering existing antibiotics useless. This threat is exemplified by N. gonorrhoeae, a sexually transmitted
gram-negative bacterium that afflicts ~87 million people every year and has recently developed resistance to
ceftriaxone, the last remaining highly effective antibiotic treatment. Untreated gonorrhea causes infertility,
pregnancy complications, neonatal blindness, severe disseminated infection, and death, prompting the CDC
and WHO to recognize drug-resistant N. gonorrhoeae as one of the five most urgent AMR threats to human
health. Traditional drug discovery has failed to keep up with AMR and there is a critical need for innovative
approaches to fill the antibiotic development pipeline with promising candidates. To solve this problem, Dr.
Anahtar proposes using predictions from ML models to efficiently guide focused testing and development of
novel compounds for the treatment of drug-resistant N. gonorrhoeae. The central hypothesis is that ML models
such as graph neural networks can identify new antibiotic candidates for N. gonorrhoeae by predicting growth
inhibitory activity from chemical structures given high-quality training data. In preliminary work, Dr. Anahtar
phenotypically screened a foundational library of 38,000 chemically diverse compounds for N. gonorrhoeae
growth inhibition, used the results to train an ML model, and deployed the model to identify novel compounds
with activity against multidrug-resistant N. gonorrhoeae. To expand the pool of novel antibiotic candidates, Dr.
Anahtar will use this ML model to screen large (10^8) chemical libraries in silico and then validate the
predictions in vitro (Aim 1). The mechanism of action of the most potent and non-toxic compounds will then be
determined using microscopic, proteomic, and genomic approaches (Aim 2). Finally, their in vivo efficacy will
be tested in a preclinical animal model of N. gonorrhoeae infection (Aim 3). The long-term goal is to discover
new biological insights into the treatment of drug-resistant bacteria. This work will be performed at the Broad
Institute, MIT, and MGH, which provide an exceptional training environment and ample scientific resources.
The candidate is supported by an outstanding scientific advisory committee with decades of experience in N.
gonorrhoeae, AMR, medicinal chemistry, and mentoring physician-scientists. This career development award
will enable Dr. Anahtar’s transition to independence with a focus on understanding and combating AMR.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Abstract
Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a devastating neuromuscular disease and a leading genetic cause of infantile
death worldwide. Despite exciting progress in the neuromuscular field that has resulted in novel therapies, there
remains no permanent cure for SMA. Therefore, developing a permanent treatment that treats the underlying
genetic perturbation and all systemic manifestations of this disease would transform patients’ life. SMA is caused
by mutations in the Survival Motor Neuron 1 (SMN1) gene. An important modifier of SMA severity is the number
of copies of a paralogous gene SMN2. The sequence of SMN2 mainly differs from SMN1 by a C•G-to-T•A
transition in exon 7 (“C6T”), which causes the skipping of exon 7 in most SMN2 transcripts due to alternative
splicing. While previous studies have demonstrated that antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) or small molecules
targeted to SMN2 gene can transiently increase full-length SMN protein expression, this approach requires
repeated dosing and has incomplete penetrance that poses challenges for patients. Therefore, I am developing
optimized base editors (BEs) that enable precise genetic alterations within defined regions of the SMN2 gene.
In this K01 proposal, I plan to extend this work by optimizing the most optimal genome editing approaches and
investigating the use of adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) to deliver these novel editing technologies in SMA
mouse models. In principle, this will create a lasting single-dose permanent treatment for SMA with several
advantages compared to targeting mutations in the SMN1 gene or exogenous gene replacement. The success
of this proposal will provide solutions to questions at the intersection of the fields of genome editing and
neurogenetics, with broad implications for the entire neuromuscular scientific community. My primary mentor in
this K01 proposal is Dr. Benjamin Kleinstiver, an expert in the optimization of CRISPR technologies, and my co-
mentors are Dr. Rashmi Kothary and Dr. Kathryn Swoboda, world leaders in SMA-related studies. Career
development and training activities will include attendance to local meetings and seminars, attendance at
national and international conferences, scientific writing, mentoring a small group in the laboratory, and
managing collaborations with other academic groups and companies. The K01 Award would be a perfect
opportunity to prepare me for the transition to an independent career by developing important career aspects
and improving my knowledge in gene editing to establish my research program, so that I can address high-
impact questions related to SMA and other neuromuscular diseases
. M
y long-term goals are to lead a
translational research team to address fundamental questions related to neuromuscular physiology, diseases,
and disorders. The convergence between physiology, genome editing, and therapeutics is where I envision my
independent research laboratory will make an impact on human health.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Background: The United States is experiencing a crisis in mental health care, in which long-term shifts
towards the emergency department (ED) for psychiatric treatment have been exacerbated by the COVID-19
pandemic – reduced inpatient hospitalization capacity, delayed outpatient appointments, extended ED
boarding, and staffing shortages, combined with substantial growth in demand for mental health services (due
in part to pandemic-related increases in stress, depression, social isolation, and anxiety, and with differential
impacts on vulnerable populations). Data-driven approaches have not been widely applied to understand
mechanisms and predictors of ED utilization for psychiatric patients, or to optimize clinical decision-making to
improve patient outcomes. Research: In this study, I will conduct secondary data analysis of 141,431 ED visits
for psychiatric care in a large regional health system from 2017-2023, extracting and preparing over 5,000
patient characteristics from the electronic health record (diagnoses, labs, medications, procedures, visits, and
notes). Aim 1: I will create a transdiagnostic subtyping system, using latent class analysis, hierarchical density-
based clustering, and neural network autoencoders, to reliably categorize and track major trends in patient
populations receiving emergency psychiatric care. Aim 2: I will develop a suite of ensemble machine learning
models to predict ED length of stay, ED boarding duration, short-term ED re-admission, transfer to inpatient
hospitalization, and post-discharge adverse events (suicide attempt, overdose, or psychotic episode). Aim 3: I
will estimate a precision treatment rule, using targeted causal inference and ensemble machine learning, to
capture heterogeneous treatment effects for primary ED disposition decisions (inpatient hospitalization, partial
hospitalization / intensive outpatient program, or outpatient monitoring) on adverse psychiatric events.
Candidate's Career Development, Goals, and Environment: This proposal's research aims and the
candidate's career development will be supported by the extensive resources available at Massachusetts
General Hospital (MGH) and Harvard Medical School, as well as formal training, coursework, and mentorship
in (T1) mental disorders and psychopathology, (T2) precision treatment optimization, (T3) hybrid pragmatic
effectiveness trials, and (T4) professional development in preparation for a future R01 submission. The
mentorship team includes Primary Mentor Dr. Jordan Smoller, a leading expert in precision psychiatry; Co-
Mentors Dr. Matthew Nock, a leader in mental disorders and suicide prevention; Dr. Susan Murphy, a leader in
precision treatment optimization; and Dr. Stephen Bartels, a leader in implementation science and hybrid
pragmatic trials; and Consultants Dr. Suzanne Bird, expert in emergency psychiatry and director of MGH Acute
Psychiatry Services; Dr. Edwin Boudreaux, expert in hybrid pragmatic trials in emergency psychiatry; and Dr.
Soroush Saghafian, expert in reinforcement learning to optimize hospital decision-making. This award will

Vineet Raghu, PhD is a computer scientist whose career goal is to improve early detection and prevention of
chronic disease by applying artificial intelligence to large datasets of medical imaging, genomics, risk factors,
and outcomes to better estimate risk and derive insight into etiology. Dr. Raghu is an Instructor of Radiology at
Harvard Medical School and research faculty at the Massachusetts General Hospital’s Cardiovascular Imaging
Research Center. In this project, he aims to develop and validate deep learning-based cardiovascular disease
risk scores from chest imaging. He will build upon his prior training in applied artificial intelligence and
genomics to gain depth of understanding in the epidemiology, pathophysiology, and preventive care of
cardiovascular disease. His specific training goals are to: 1) Gain understanding of how physicians and
patients make decisions about preventive interventions in older adults, 2) Learn to apply statistical genetics
techniques to single nucleotide polymorphism and epigenetic data to investigate molecular pathways of
cardiovascular disease, and 3) Gain deeper understanding of the pathophysiology of cardiovascular disease to
improve collaboration with physician-scientists, and 4) Develop grant writing skills and training in the
responsible conduct of research. Dr. Raghu’s training plan includes didactic training from Harvard Medical
School and Harvard School of Public Health and hands-on research training to gain the proposed skillset in
preparation for research independence. His mentorship committee has diverse expertise in imaging, deep
learning, genetics, geriatrics, and cardiovascular epidemiology to support his development. He and his
mentorship team will have individual meetings to discuss specific research aims and advisory meetings to
discuss broader career development goals. Dr. Raghu will supplement didactic training by completing the
following innovative research aims. In Aim 1, he will develop deep learning models to estimate cardiovascular
disease risk using chest CT. In Aim 2, he will identify genetic loci and biologic aging indices associated with
CT-based risk estimates. Finally, in Aim 3, he will test whether CT-based risk estimates can identify persons at
risk for incident cardiovascular events beyond current risk scores and screening criteria. These aims will be
carried out in existing large epidemiologic cohorts comprising over 70,000 individuals in total. Completion of
these aims will provide preliminary data for a potential R01 application in Years 4 and 5 to investigate whether
CT-based models improve uptake and efficacy of preventive care and reduce cardiovascular events, to expand
this approach to other imaging modalities, or to use imaging and multi-omics to identify molecular pathways of
disease. This proposal will give Dr. Raghu excellent training to achieve his goal of being an independent
investigator who develops deep learning-based risk scores and 1) collaborates with physicians to implement
such models to improve preventive care and 2) uses such models to better understand disease etiology.

Diverticulitis is among the most common gastrointestinal conditions leading to emergency department visits and
hospitalizations. Uncomplicated diverticulitis is usually mild and self-limiting, but about 10% of patients will
develop complications including abscess, fistula, obstruction, bleeding, or perforation, and over 20-30% will
experience at least one recurrence or ongoing gastrointestinal complaints. Although up to 50% of patients with
complicated diverticulitis require emergent surgery, there remains considerable uncertainty about whether most
other diverticulitis patients should be medically managed or offered elective segmental colectomy. Recent
guidelines recommend a personalized approach, with consideration of segmental resection according to risk for
recurrence or future complications. However, little is known about factors predisposing patients to unfavorable
outcomes. Among patients with their first episode of diverticulitis, there is a significant unmet need to identify
those at higher risk of recurrence or future complications to guide decision-making about clinical management.
Thus, I propose to apply artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to clinical data including natural language
processing (NLP) for narrative notes (Aim 1) and deep learning for imaging (Aim 2) in a large-scale electronic
health record (EHR) database to predict recurrence and long-term complications of diverticulitis. Building upon
findings from the first two aims, in Aim 3, I will validate the prediction model for diverticulitis recurrence in an
external EHR dataset. My overarching goal is to develop a clinical decision support tool incorporating NLP of
clinical documentation, computed tomography (CT)-based deep learning, lifestyle, and clinical factors to predict
outcomes in diverticulitis. Findings from this project will enable the utilization of comprehensive information from
EHR for diverticulitis research, advance understanding of novel predictors of long-term outcomes of diverticulitis,
and contribute to the development of a clinical prediction tool to facilitate risk stratification and guide disease
management. Through this work, I will receive formal training in using NLP for unstructured clinical notes;
developing deep learning algorithms for imaging; and modeling for clinical risk prediction. I will be
mentored/advised by an interdisciplinary team that includes Dr. Andrew Chan, a gastroenterologist and
epidemiologist with expertise in diverticulitis; Dr. Katherine Andriole, an expert in radiology imaging informatics,
deep learning, and machine learning; Dr. Ashwin Ananthakrishnan, a gastroenterologist with expertise in utilizing
NLP in EHR; Dr. Lisa Strate, a gastroenterologist with expertise in diverticular disease; Dr. Avinash
Kambadakone-Ramesh, a radiologist with expertise in abdominal imaging and advanced CT applications; and
Dr. Alisa Manning, a biostatistician with expertise in clinical research using EHR data. The outstanding training
opportunities with key leaders in their respective fields will provide me with new skills in the application of AI
methods including NLP, machine learning, and deep learning to clinical data and risk prediction modeling,
positioning me for a successful, independent career in advancing precision medicine in digestive diseases.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Early-onset Alzheimer’s disease (EOAD) is a critically understudied form of AD associated with a more
aggressive clinical course, more “atypical” non-amnestic clinical presentations, more severe neuropathology
(particularly
neurofibrillary tangles), and increased heritability compared with its late-onset counterpart. At
present, little is known about the mechanisms underlying the spread of tau pathology and genetic risk factors
that predispose it.
Candidate Development and Environment: The candidate’s career goal is to become an independent investigator
with deep knowledge of multimodal neuroimaging techniques to elucidate the mechanisms underlying cognitive
dysfunction in AD and related dementias and to develop tools that help improve individual patients’ well-being.
With this K award, the candidate will extend his expertise in multimodal neuroimaging by gaining critical training
in longitudinal positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), graph theory, and
analysis of gene expression in the brain. This new skill set will allow him to characterize the mechanisms of
disease progression in EOAD with unprecedented specificity. The candidate will analyze the rich multimodal
neuroimaging dataset collected in the Longitudinal Early-onset Alzheimer’s Disease Study (LEADS), the largest
and best characterized cohort of patients with sporadic EOAD to date. His mentor/advisory team consists of
world-renowned scientists throughout the United States with broad expertise spanning behavioral neurology,
cognitive, systems, and network neurosciences, and imaging genetics. The state-of-the-art resources and
facilities at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School will provide an ideal environment for
the candidate’s training and will foster his growth toward scientific independence.
Research Project: The proposed project aims to investigate the role of large-scale brain network connectivity in
the longitudinal spread of tau pathology in EOAD using novel graph theoretical methods, and to identify specific
genetic biomarkers that may confer vulnerability to the cortical spread of tau in this population via integrative
neuroimaging-transcriptomic analyses. Specific gaps in the literature will be filled by cross-sectionally
establishing the relationships between tau accumulation and intrinsic brain functional and structural connectivity
(Aim 1), validating the utility of brain connectivity in predicting longitudinal tau spread using directional graph
theory regression analysis (Aim 2), and identifying specific genes whose cortical expression is associated with
the topography of longitudinal tau spread (Aim 3) in EOAD. Knowledge gained from this project will facilitate the
inclusion of patients with EOAD in clinical trials by identifying novel imaging and genetic biomarkers sensitive to
clinical progression in this population.

over-production of longer, aggregation-prone β-amyloid (Aβ) fragments (including Aβ42 and 43) relative to
shorter, non-aggregating fragments (including Aβ37 and 38) are likely critical drivers of disease in both late-
onset, sporadic AD (LOAD) and autosomal dominant AD (ADAD). The balance between production of
aggregating and non-aggregating forms of Aβ is a direct result of the kinetics by which the γ-secretase
complex sequentially cleaves amyloid precursor protein. Alterations in γ-secretase function can have profound
neurodegenerative and cognitive consequences, while modulation of γ-secretase has therapeutic potential in
LOAD and ADAD. Pathogenic variants in Presenilin-1 (PSEN1), the key catalytic subunit in the γ-secretase
complex, are the most common cause of ADAD. There is substantial heterogeneity in Age of Symptom Onset
(a range of >30 years) and biomarker progression across PSEN1 variants. The proposed K01 project will
characterize differences in γ-secretase function across ~250 unique ADAD-causing PSEN1 variants in the
presence and absence of two structurally distinct γ-secretase modulators (GSMs), measured in a cell-based
model system (Aim 1). In Aim 2, variant-specific characteristics will be combined with cross-sectional cognitive
and biomarker measures from carriers of corresponding PSEN1 variants participating in the Dominantly
Inherited Alzheimer’s Network Observational Study (DIAN-Obs), a large international study in which over 80
unique PSEN1 pathogenic variants are represented. This translational dataset will be used to examine whether
differences in γ-secretase function between PSEN1 mutations can account for the heterogeneity in Age of
Symptom Onset, cognition, and AD biomarkers. Aim 3 will utilize longitudinal data from DIAN-Obs to examine
whether mutation-specific characteristics 1) predict change in biomarkers and cognition and 2) increase power
to detect estimated treatment effects for relevant trial outcomes. Leveraging available data from DIAN Trials
Unit, exploratory analyses will assess whether inclusion of variant-dependent characteristics can improve
stratification approaches for future clinical trials. This K01 will elucidate mechanisms underlying AD, facilitate
ongoing ADAD clinical trials, and support the development of GSMs as possible therapeutics. To help Dr.
Stephanie Schultz achieve these aims, a multidisciplinary mentorship team has been assembled from the
Harvard Medical School community and DIAN Leadership team to complement coursework in protein
characterization, translational research, advanced statistical analysis, and clinical trials. Dr. Jasmeer Chhatwal
will be the primary mentor overseeing research and career progress. Dr. Schultz will receive mentoring from
Dr. Dennis Selkoe on the mechanisms underlying AD, Drs. Reisa Sperling and Eric McDade on translational
and clinical trial design, and Dr. Chengjie Xiong on advanced statistical methods for translational research.
This comprehensive training plan will enable Dr. Schultz to become an independent translational scientist.

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that leads to dramatic effects on the affected
individuals and their families. While the characterization of the genetic contribution to AD and underlying
molecular mechanisms has advanced the understanding of the disease in recent years, studies have failed to
find definitive mechanisms that account for disease progression. The influence of pathogens on AD potentially
mediates an environmental impact on the established genetic contributions to AD. Here, we directly dissect the
contribution of pathogen-related effects down to the cell-type-specific molecular basis by systematic profiling,
computational integration, and experimental validation of the transcriptional signatures across individuals, brain
regions, and cell types. In Aim 1, we use scRNA-seq in human, mouse, and human iPSC brain organoid samples of
AD that are infected with Herpes Simplex Virus 1 or Cytomegalovirus (HSV-1/CMV) to generate millions of single-
cell (sc) level maps with the end goal of a transcriptional atlas. In Aim 2, we analyze the resulting datasets and
underlying molecular mechanisms, enabling us to discover and converge genes, pathways, cell types, and
brain regions to functional and causal mechanisms that drive pathogen-related alterations. In Aim 3, we use
our well-established iPSC model to test our predicted mechanisms with both high-throughput and cell-type
specific assays. The resulting datasets, computational predictions, and experimentally-supported mechanisms
will shed light on the pathogen-related influences on AD pathology and will help deepen our understanding of
the disease in general as we develop more personalized therapeutic approaches to treating AD.

 Sleep is essential for brain health, and neurodegenerative diseases are associated with substantial
sleep disruptions. Disrupted sleep is now thought to not just be a symptom of neurodegeneration, but
potentially to also contribute to the onset of the disease. Notably, Alzheimer’s disease pathology is associated
with loss of EEG slow waves during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. Sleep is thought to be important
for clearance of proteins such as amyloid-beta and tau from the brain into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and
the human brain exhibits waves of CSF flow during NREM sleep, suggesting that CSF flow during sleep may
play a role in its effects on brain health. This proposal aims to understand the link between neural slow waves
during sleep and CSF flow in healthy aging and in individuals at risk for Alzheimer’s disease. We hypothesize
that neural activity can induce CSF flow through its effects on cerebral blood volume. We in turn predict that
loss of neural slow waves during sleep in the aging brain may lead to loss of sleep-dependent CSF flow, and
that this decline is associated with Alzheimer’s disease genetic risk factors. To test our hypothesis, we will use
multimodal imaging to simultaneously measure neural activity, hemodynamics, and CSF flow. We will test the
link between neural activity and CSF flow, and will identify whether the decline in sleep slow waves in older
adults is associated with less CSF flow. We will further examine whether this process is more severely
disrupted in healthy older adults with genetic risk for Alzheimer’s disease. Together, these studies will establish
a biological mechanism for how altered sleep in aging leads to altered fluid flow dynamics, and this knowledge
will form an essential foundation for the development of future biomarkers and interventions to evaluate and
modulate CSF flow in the aging brain.

aging population. The complexity of its pathophysiology has proven to be a daunting challenge in the
development of effective pharmacological interventions. We have recently shown that noninvasive Gamma
ENtrainment Using Sensory stimuli (GENUS) to induce neural oscillations in the gamma frequency range (30-
90 Hz) could ameliorate pathology in various AD mouse models. Mice subjected to GENUS regime exhibited
positive effects on microglia, astrocytes, cerebral vasculature, as well as reduced accumulation of amyloid and
hyperphosphorylated tau in respective amyloid and tauopathy mouse models. However, the mechanisms by
which GENUS impacts cell-cell interactions, in particular, interactions between neurons and microglia, are not
clear. To this end, we will utilize a combination of AD mouse models and innovative iPSC 3D co-culture system
to assess the role of microglia in modifying the GENUS response, focusing on the contributions of microglial AD
risk genes, APOE and TREM2, in modulating the neuroimmune interactions in response to GENUS.

Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are devastating and fatal
neurodegenerative diseases that strike middle-aged adults just as they reach full familial, financial and career
potential. Initially thought to be quite distinct, FTLD and ALS are now recognized to share many clinical,
pathological, and genetic signatures, but the mechanistic basis of their shared and distinct circuitry remains
unknown at the molecular level. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have uncovered multiple common
weak-effect variants, but the vast majority are non-coding, making it difficult to identify their target genes and
the cell types where they act. To address this challenge, in Aim 1, we systematically profile the transcriptional
and epigenomic alterations of FTLD and ALS patients at single-cell resolution using post-mortem brain
samples. In Aim 2, we integrate the resulting datasets to study the link between genetic, epigenomic,
transcriptional, and cellular signatures of FTLD and ALS, and to study the common and distinct genes and
pathways altered in each, to predict new therapeutic targets. In Aim 3, we validate the molecular and cellular
effects of these targets using high-throughput directed perturbation experiments and both cell-autonomous and
non-autonomous phenotypes guided by our predicted pathways, and we disseminate all our results to the
community. The resulting datasets, analyses, and validated targets will provide an invaluable resource to
understand the mechanisms of action of FTLD and ALS, and the common and unique circuitry towards new
therapeutic targets.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Model organisms have proven invaluable as more tractable systems to study fundamental principles of biology and by yielding breakthroughs that result from studying evolutionary innovations, for example, GFP, from jellyfish, or CRISPR, from bacteria. My goal is to leverage a new model system, developed during my postdoctoral work, that is uniquely positioned to provide insights of both types: Clytia hemisphaerica, a species of Mediterranean jellyfish.  This proposal uses Clytia's distinctive features to identify precise mechanisms at the interface of neural development, neural regeneration, and systems neuroscience. First, Clytia are tiny (<1mm-1cm), transparent, and genetically tractable, making it possible to image and manipulate the activity of every neuron in the nervous system simultaneously, in vivo, using genetically encoded optical techniques. Further, Clytia numerically scale their nervous system at least an order of magnitude during their lifespan without disrupting system function, ending with more than ten thousand neurons. It is therefore also possible to observe continuous differentiation, migration, axon targeting, and functional activity simultaneously across the whole organism. Lastly, Clytia have poorly understood and powerful regenerative capabilities. These include the regeneration of large populations of genetically ablated neurons, with rapid recovery of the behaviors that those neurons control. These properties make Clytia an experimentally tractable platform to investigate:  · Fundamental questions in systems neuroscience, including mechanisms underlying behaviors and behavior states, roles of neuromodulation, and approaches for studying system organization and function across scales.  · Basic principles of neurodevelopment, particularly at the interface of development and function.  · Mechanisms enabling regeneration and the seamless integration of new neurons into a functioning network. In Aim 1, I will characterize the molecular phenotypes of neurons and establish CRISPR-based knock-in to target effectors to specific subpopulations of cells. In Aim 2, I will use a coordinated behavior as my point of entry and develop and test models of underlying neural mechanisms. In Aim 3, I will examine how this behavioral system is robust to constant neurogenesis, and the mechanisms that enable its rapid recovery following genetic ablation of neurons.  My vision is that, once the key foundational work has been completed and published, Clytia will become a widely used model system. This proposal serves as the first step, laying the foundation for my future independent program and for a Clytia community more broadly, and providing the essential training that I need to fill gaps in my knowledge, focusing on computational and single-cell RNA sequencing approaches.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Rationale: All cells produce incomplete proteins, a consequence of surprisingly common errors in gene
expression. Cells have evolved multiple mechanisms to suppress expression of incomplete proteins, including
the degradation of mRNAs containing premature stop codons (nonsense variants). Such nonsense-mediated
mRNA quality control occurs in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. The bacterial process is grounded in
premature termination of transcription by Rho and subsequent RNA degradation, a mechanism reliant on tight
coupling of transcription and translation. The existence and apparent universality of nonsense-mediated quality
control has been taken to suggest that incomplete proteins are highly cytotoxic. However, this proposition has
not been systematically investigated. Furthermore, recent work from the Li lab has revealed that a broad swath
of bacteria – notably B. subtilis and other Firmicutes (Bacillota) – altogether lack nonsense-mediated quality
control and transcription-translation coupling. In other recent work, I developed an approach for massively
parallel measurements of bacterial growth inhibition by complex libraries of protein fragments, derived from
array-synthesized oligonucleotides. This methodological innovation provides the previously missing tool
needed to systematically investigate cytotoxicity of incomplete proteins. In this proposal I bring together these
conceptual and technological breakthroughs, along with computational analyses and other complementary
methods, to address fundamental questions about the physiological impacts of incomplete proteins and the
importance of their suppression. I hypothesize that most incomplete proteoforms are innocuous, but a subset
are cytotoxic, and that B. subtilis protein sequences have evolved to limit truncated variant toxicity. I will also
investigate the contributions of incomplete proteins to bactericidal activity of ribosome-inhibitory antibiotics, and
the evolutionary pathways enabled by a lack of suppression of premature stop codon mutants.
Objective: To address these questions, I will systematically define the cytotoxicity of incomplete proteins by
measuring growth rate effects of incomplete proteins from across the B. subtilis and E. coli proteomes,
determining protein features associated with cytotoxicity, and further investigating physiological effects of
select proteoforms using ribosome profiling, RNA sequencing, and pull-down mass spectrometry. I will also
determine how incomplete proteins contribute to bactericidal activity of ribosome-inhibiting antibiotics by
combining translatomic and proteomic measurements of drug-induced incomplete protein production with
massively parallel cytotoxicity measurements. In a third approach, I will redefine the functions and evolutionary
roles of pseudogenes in Firmicutes by using a knockout library to demonstrate premature-stop pseudogene
function and employing bioinformatic analyses to determine the prevalence of duplication and truncation as a
path to novel genes. Finally, I will use a high-throughput assay to systematically map the landscape of
potentially beneficial truncation variants.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Alternative splicing allows multiple gene products to be generated from a single gene, and contributes
to transcriptomic diversity across tissues, development, and individuals. Given that most genes undergo
alternative splicing, the disruption of splicing is a common contributor to disease. Pathology can result through
mutations affecting the splicing of particular genes as well as broad splicing defects that affect many genes.
Advances in sequencing technology have greatly simplified the problem of identifying the splicing products
present in a given tissue and determining how splicing is perturbed in diseases states. But the problem
remains to extract actionable interpretations from the hundreds or thousands of splicing changes that even a
single sequencing experiment might reveal.
 The goal of this project is to understand how perturbations of splicing regulators connect to the resulting
changes in splicing. I will consider both variation at RNA-binding protein target sites and disruption of the RBPs
themselves. I will first consider the connection between short tandem repeat (STR) variation and splicing.
Given that many of the most abundant STRs in the genome match the sequence preferences of important
splicing factors, I will leverage sequencing data spanning hundreds of individuals to determine whether these
highly mutable sequences represent a frequently ignored source of splicing variation. I will then consider the
regulatory characteristics of RBPs themselves. I will first reframe the approach commonly used to integrate
RBP binding and splicing data as a flexible linear model which can incorporate additional information and
confounders. I will then apply this to recent ENCODE panel of RBP binding and knockdown data to infer the
networks of splicing events regulated by a given RBP. I will then seek to use these networks to interpret
patterns of altered splicing in disease states.
 I will carry out this work under the mentorship of Christopher Burge at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology (MIT), a leader in the field of alternative splicing. Given the Burge lab’s long track record of strong
computational and experimental work, this will provide an ideal environment for both carrying out this research
and developing the skills I will need for an independent career as a computational biologist. The proposed
training will involve frequent interaction with experts in the study of RNA binding proteins and splicing, including
the research groups that generated many of the datasets I will study, such as the Graveley and Yeo labs.
Through this work I will develop further technical expertise in a number statistical and computational
approaches and be immersed in the biology of splicing. I will have access to the experience and expertise I will
need to transition from the evolutionary genomics of my PhD to the study of RNA processing and its regulation

Developmental dyslexia is a specific learning disability characterized by word reading difficulties that impacts 5-
12% of children in the US. Dyslexia is most commonly associated with impaired sensitivity to language sounds
(phonological awareness). However the ultimate goal of reading is not to access sound, but to access meaning.
Although the neurocognitive mechanisms underlying sound processing and its impairments in dyslexia are
relatively well understood, little is known about the role and neurocognitive basis of sensitivity to units of
meaning (morphological awareness) in dyslexia. This is a major gap in knowledge, as children with dyslexia
typically demonstrate poor morphological awareness, and decoding polymorphemic words becomes increasingly
important for academic success through elementary and middle school. Guided by the Lexical Quality framework
and Connectionist theories of reading, the current proposal will investigate the neurocognitive mechanisms
underlying morphological processing in relation to word reading children with dyslexia (4th-5th grade) as well as
age-matched (4th-5th grade) and skill-matched (2nd-3rd grade) typical readers. I will collect structural and functional
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data during a novel morphological processing task. Participants will also
complete a comprehensive assessment of oral language, reading, and cognitive skills. First I will characterize
the neurocognitive basis of morphological processing and its development in typical readers. I will then test the
hypothesis that the neurocognitive basis of morphological processing differs between typically developing
children and those with dyslexia. Finally, I will identify the neural correlates of morphological processing that are
associated with behavioral measures of word reading (dis)ability, advancing our understanding of dyslexia by
connecting brain to behavior. This work is of theoretical and practical importance, as morphology becomes
increasingly important for successful reading over time, yet neurocognitive models of reading and dyslexia rarely
include morphological processes. Additionally, morphology may be one powerful way to compensate for
phonological deficits in dyslexia. Findings may inform educational and clinical practices to capitalize on
morphological processing as a promising compensatory mechanism, and provide research-based intervention
for struggling readers. The proposed study will provide ample opportunities to complete the fellowship training
goals by advancing the trainee’s: 1) conceptual knowledge of dyslexia, 2) technical training in fMRI
neuroimaging, 3) advanced methodological knowledge, and 4) translational skills in working with educators and
clinicians. This work will be conducted at MIT and MGH IHP, both vibrant academic communities with extensive
resources for pediatric neuroimaging, and supervised by leading experts in the field with decades of experience
conducting research related to reading and dyslexia.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Class Ia ribonucleotide reductases (RNRs) are anti-cancer and antibiotic drug targets due to their role in the
biosynthesis of deoxyribonucleotides. They convert ribonucleotides to deoxyribonucleotides using radical-
based chemistry with reducing equivalents coming from a pair of cysteine residues in the active site that form a
disulfide upon enzyme turnover. Recent structural work elucidating the active state structure of the class Ia
RNR of Escherichia coli has revealed for the first time, the intact 32-Å-long pathway for radical transfer
between subunits that is responsible for the generation of a catalytically essential radical species in the
enzyme active site. In this proposed research, I will investigate the role of water channels in the proton transfer
that occurs concomitant with electron transfer. I will also investigate the role of a tryptophan residue (W48) in a
radical transfer pathway that otherwise involves tyrosine residues. Furthermore, I will probe the structural
rearrangements that occur in order to facilitate re-reduction of the active site disulfide. This re-reduction
pathway is known to be dependent on the C-terminal tail of the α subunit of RNR, which shuttles reducing
equivalents from thioredoxin to the active site, but no structural snapshots of this process have ever been
captured. Here, I propose to use site-specific mutagenesis to investigate the involvement of water channels in
proton transfer by assessing the catalytic competency of RNR variants in which the water networks have been
disrupted. I intend to assess the role of W48 in the PCET pathway through the site-specific incorporation of
unnatural W analogues which will give us a spectroscopic handle with which to directly monitor radical transfer
to and from W48. Finally, I propose to capture structural snapshots of the re-reduction steps of RNR, including
a structure of RNR with thioredoxin using cryogenic electron microscopy. These studies will enable us to
answer several of the major outstanding questions of this prototypical RNR. This work will also enable me, a
physical inorganic and materials chemist by training, to gain expertise in biochemical and structural biology
methods which will inform new research directions that will benefit from a synthesis of these two skill sets. As
one of the world’s foremost research institutions, MIT is an ideal and highly collaborative environment in which
to pursue the studies described in this proposal. Furthermore, as an internationally recognized leader in the
field of structural biology, Prof. Drennan’s scientific mentorship will enable me to excel in my undertaking of this
research.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Project Summary: Arousal state transitions are evoked by unexpected or aversive stimuli that change the
context of the environment. These transitions prime the brain to be more alert to sensory input and optimize
sensory processing for goal-directed behavior. VIP neurons disinhibit excitatory neurons and are known to alter
excitatory sensory processing in response to top-down or neuromodulatory input. VIP neurons activate in
response to contextual changes and their activity increases during periods of increased arousal. However, it is
unclear how changes in arousal lead to VIP activation, or indeed if VIP neurons modulate sensory processing in
an arousal-state-dependent manner. Arousal state is controlled by norepinephrine (NE) release from the locus
coeruleus (LC), which fires in response to contextual change and projects to the cortex. LC-NE signaling is a
putative mediator of VIP activation following arousal state transitions, but this mechanism has never been
experimentally addressed. In this proposal, I will use the visual cortex as a model to test the hypothesis that
arousal state transitions modify cortical sensory processing through LC-NE mediated VIP activation to optimize
context-dependent goal-directed behavior.
Excitatory neurons in the visual cortex become more selective and reliable during increased arousal states. In
Aim 1, I will examine the role of VIP neurons in mediating these and other changes in visual processing by using
dual-wavelength two-photon calcium imaging to simultaneously record excitatory and VIP neurons during
different arousal states. I will then use optotagging to examine the temporal pattern of VIP activity as it relates to
changes in visual processing. I will then test if VIP-driven changes in visual processing mirror the effects of
arousal states on visual processing using optogenetic VIP stimulation. In Aim 2, I will examine the relationship
between LC-NE and VIP activity using optotagging, LC axonal imaging, and NE imaging. I will then test if LC-
NE stimulation drives VIP activation and alters visual processing using LC axonal optogenetics in V1. In Aim 3,
I will relate these findings to goal-directed behavior using a learned visual discrimination task. I will determine if
LC axonal and VIP neuronal activity are predictive of discrimination accuracy and improved excitatory encoding.
Finally, I will optogenetically activate or inhibit VIP neurons during the task to directly measure their contribution
to arousal-driven changes in discrimination accuracy. The Sur research group at MIT is an ideal environment to
pursue the research outlined in this proposal and to receive training that will prepare me for a career as an
independent investigator. I will have the opportunity to master technologies pioneered in the Sur research group,
including next-generation dual-wavelength two-photon imaging, optotagging, quantitative analyses of behavior
and its neuronal correlates, optogenetic manipulations, and computational analysis of neuronal populations to
examine changes in sensory processing and encoding. Taken together, the research project, training plan, and
research environment create a path to future independence well suited to my career goals.

fastest growing neurological disorders in prevalence, disability-adjusted life years, and deaths, an increasingly
significant public health issue. Its core motor symptoms are caused by the dysfunction and death of dopamine
(DA) neurons in the Substantia Nigra pars compacta (SNpc). These neurons are particularly vulnerable, and
understanding the molecular underpinnings of this enhanced vulnerability may be critical for developing disease-
modifying treatments. Due to the irreversible nature of neurodegeneration, neuroprotective therapies are likely
to be most effective when targeting early, more reversible forms of neuronal dysfunction. In PD, one such early
pathological feature is the degeneration of SNpc DA neuron axons, which are lost earlier than the cell bodies
and whose degeneration more closely correlates with the decline of efficacy of dopamine replacement therapy
(the primary symptomatic treatment for PD). Because axon loss may be targeted prior to cell death, identifying
its mechanisms may be essential for developing neuroprotective therapies.
 Prior work indicates that axonal mitochondria are dynamically regulated and specialized to support axonal
function and survival. In this proposal, I seek to identify mechanisms by which axonal mitochondria are
specialized to promote the function and survival of SNpc DA neuron axons, and to identify how
alterations in these processes may contribute to PD pathophysiology. In Aim 1, I will develop a novel
molecular labeling and volumetric imaging platform for characterizing baseline features of mitochondria in the
axons of SNpc DA neurons, such as their density across different striatal subregions, and quantify their spatial
relationship to presynaptic structures. In Aim 2, I will implement an immunopurification strategy (Mitotag) for
separately isolating axonal and somatodendritic mitochondria from SNpc DA neurons, and carry out proteomics
and functional assays to identify the molecular and functional specialization of axonal mitochondria. In Aim 3, I
will then carry out similar experiments in a viral PD mouse model to identify how alterations to axonal
mitochondria may contribute to axonal degeneration. Using these findings as a guide, I will then carry out
overexpression or knockdown experiments to evaluate whether rescuing axonal mitochondrial defects could
alleviate axonal degeneration in PD.
 By delving into the fundamental biology of how mitochondria are specialized to sustain axonal survival
and probing how their functions are perturbed in disease, this proposal will help shed light into basic principles
of neuronal maintenance and function while potentially identifying early mechanisms of disease that can be
targeted before irreversible cell death.

Experience with the external world is essential for fine-tuning immature sensory circuits during critical periods in
development. In visual systems, experience regulates the alignment of visual information from the ipsilateral and
contralateral eye onto neurons in the binocular primary visual cortex (bV1). At the onset of the critical period for
binocular vision, bV1 neurons respond to distinct orientation preferences to each eye. With visual experience,
synaptic inputs from each eye get modified, and bV1 neurons develop matching orientation preferences.
Disrupting visual experience during this critical period, however, can elicit severe impairments in binocular vision,
causing amblyopia. It remains unclear how synaptic inputs are modified to regulate the development of
orientation matching in bV1 neurons. Hebbian and heterosynaptic plasticity are mechanisms of experience-
dependent plasticity that modify synaptic inputs based on the correlation of pre- and postsynaptic neuronal
responses and on the activity of neighboring synapses, respectively. Together, these two mechanisms can
shape the selectivity of neuronal responses by strengthening synapses that are correlated with the postsynaptic
neuron or with synaptic neighbors, and by weakening those that are uncorrelated. I hypothesize that Hebbian
and heterosynaptic mechanisms regulate the alignment and plasticity of eye-specific inputs onto bV1
neurons over the critical period. To test this hypothesis, I will chronically image the visual responses of the
neuronal soma and of dendritic spines using in vivo two-photon calcium imaging to track eye-specific inputs on
L2/3 bV1 neurons. I will then map the synaptic composition of the physiologically identified dendritic spines post
hoc by implementing a novel tissue expansion technology called Magnified Analysis of the Proteome (MAP) that
allows for super-resolution imaging of intact tissue. I will combine these cutting-edge technologies in my two
aims to delineate how the alignment of somatic orientation preference arises through synaptic remodeling of
eye-specific inputs. In Aim 1, I will characterize the functional, structural, and molecular properties of eye-specific
inputs across development to determine whether Hebbian and heterosynaptic plasticity is taking place during
somatic orientation matching. In Aim 2, I will deprive the contralateral eye of visual experience using monocular
deprivation (MD) to determine how disruptions in binocular vision impact eye-specific inputs on bV1 neurons.
Together, these experiments will answer fundamental questions on the nature of experience-dependent plasticity
in the binocular visual cortex. Furthermore, these studies will provide critical insight into the synaptic basis of
amblyopia, as well as neurodevelopmental disorders that are induced by synaptic dysfunction.

Across all life, gene expression depends upon the faithful and timely transcription of messenger RNAs by RNA
polymerase. The molecular details of RNA polymerase (RNAP) elongation have been determined for enzymes
from a few species, but it is unclear whether these examples are representative of the whole. Recently, RNAP
from the model gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis was found to be uncoupled from translation and travel
at a much faster rate than RNAP from its gram-negative counterpart, Escherichia coli. This observation is
complemented by known differences in transcriptional regulation between these species. I hypothesize that
because many mechanisms of gene regulation act upon elongating RNAP, changes in elongation rate will
affect how this regulation occurs. The goal of my proposal is to determine the causes of elongation rate
divergence between B. subtilis and E. coli and to examine the roles of B. subtilis RNAP-associated factors in
co-transcriptional gene regulation. Because pausing is a major determinant of RNAP elongation rate in vivo, in
Aim 1 of my proposal I will determine differences in pausing between B. subtilis and E. coli using nascent RNA
sequencing. In Aim 2, I will examine intrinsic and trans factors affecting B. subtilis and E. coli RNAP elongation
rate in vitro using single-molecule microscopy. In Aim 3, I will establish functions of B. subtilis RNAP-
associated factors with a genetic interaction screen. This work will illuminate the idiosyncrasies of B. subtilis
transcriptional machinery, which are likely shared by other Firmicutes bacteria including the pathogens S.
aureus and C. difficile. Because RNAP is an established antibiotic target, understanding differences in RNAP
function across bacteria could inform the development of novel species-specific antibiotics.
My fellowship training plan combines the knowledge and experience of my sponsors, Dr. Gene-Wei Li and Dr.
Jeff Gelles, to facilitate my research and career goals. Dr. Li has a strong background in quantitative biology
and will provide me training in the design of sequencing experiments and computational data analysis. Dr.
Gelles has years of experience in single-molecule biophysics that will be a major asset has I develop my own
skills in this area. Dr. Gelles has also mentored several post-doctoral trainees that have obtained independent
research positions. The support of my sponsors in combination with the research infrastructure and career
opportunities at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology will facilitate the completion of the research aims in
this proposal and my development as an independent scientist.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY. To find an object in a complex scene, we use feature-based attention to guide our
search, typically in conjunction with spatial attention and targeting eye movements. When searching for our keys
on a table, for example, the features of the keys are used as an attentional template that guides the eyes to the
various objects sharing features with keys until the keys are found. Work from our own and other labs has found
that objects with attended features or attended locations are processed more efficiently in visual cortex, while
the processing of unattended, distracting objects is suppressed. To design an effective neural prosthesis or to
treat people with sensory or attentional impairments, we need a better mechanistic understanding of these
attentional mechanisms at the systems level. The interconnected structures important for the control of attention
have many common features. At the surface level, these common features suggest there may be little difference
in their functions. However, our results show surprising specificity instead. We find that the ventral pre-arcuate
area (VPA) and the frontal eye fields (FEF) in prefrontal cortex (PFC) have different functions in visual search.
Specifically, VPA appears to mediate the selection of likely targets based on their features, and FEF directs
spatial attention and gaze to those possible targets until the object of the search, the target, is found. We
hypothesize that VPA and FEF work together as an interconnected system for guiding gaze to objects we are
searching for, and that they also provide attentional feedback to the occipital and temporal cortex, including the
mid-superior temporal sulcus (mid-STS) region. This feedback biases visual processing in favor of attended
target features. In Aim 1, we will test whether feedback from FEF to visual cortex and VPA is specific for attended
locations, as we propose, or whether the feedback conveys priority values computed from both attended features
and locations. In Aim 2, we will use electrical stimulation coupled with functional magnetic resonance imaging
(fMRI) to finely map the connectome of the mid-STS region, which receives projections from VPA and has been
recently proposed as an important component of the system for the top-down control of attention. The published
connectome will provide a test of anatomical mapping principles that we recently discovered in PFC, and it will
be a valuable resource for the neuroscience community. In Aim 3, we will use neurophysiological recordings in
VPA, FEF, the mid-STS, and other structures proposed to be important for attention, coupled with causal
methods such as optogenetics and muscimol injections to test our hypotheses about the roles of the different
components. One of the key innovations of this project is that we will map the connectivity of the recorded sites
with electrical stimulation and fMRI so that we can target our recordings to the specific neuronal groups in
different structures that are interconnected with one another. In total, we expect these studies to give us the best
account so far of how the interactions among multiple brain structures leads to effective visual processing during
attention to object features.

Title: Systematic identification of novel anti-phage defense mechanisms in the E. coli pangenome
There is an urgent need for new therapies and approaches for treating antibiotic-resistant bacterial
infections. One promising, but underdeveloped approach called phage therapy aims to use the
viruses that infect bacteria, called bacteriophages (or just phages). Although there have been a
handful of case studies reporting success, including for the treatment of ESKAPE pathogens of most
dire concern, the long-term efficacy and prospects for wide-spread use of phage therapy remains
highly uncertain. A key challenge is that bacteria often harbor potent anti-phage defense mechanisms
that enable them to resist or overcome viral infection. These anti-phage mechanisms have emerged
from the long-standing, fierce coevolutionary battle between bacteria and phages, with a molecular
'arms race' leading bacteria to evolve diverse mechanisms for defending themselves and phages, in
turn, evolving counter-defense strategies. The anti-phage arsenal of bacteria includes restriction-
modification (RM) and CRISPR-Cas systems. In recent years computational studies have identified
dozens of additional systems, but these studies have critical limitations, and our own experimental
studies have indicated that there are dozens, and likely hundreds, of additional systems still to be
discovered. By developing and applying a powerful, high-throughput functional selection procedure,
we aim to identify the anti-phage systems present in a diverse collection of 1,500+ strains of E. coli,
including a range of pathogenic strains. We will screen for defense against a panel of 10 different
coliphages. Bioinformatic analyses, particularly homology detection and structural predictions, will be
done to assess the conservation, genomic context, and predicted biochemical functions of the newly
identified systems. Thus, our work will lay the foundation for detailed molecular studies of the diverse
new systems identified. As with prior studies of anti-phage defense, we anticipate that the new
systems will drive the discovery of new molecular mechanisms, which may, in turn, form the
foundation of a new generation of precision molecular tools. It has also become clear in recent years
that many cell autonomous components of eukaryotic innate immunity have distant homologs in
bacteria. As such, our work may also reveal evolutionarily conserved facets of immunity across the
kingdoms of life. Finally, the methodology developed will be broadly applicable to virtually any
bacterial pathogen, work that we anticipate will inform ongoing and future efforts to develop phages as
therapeutic agents.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) metastasis is a major cause of mortality, yet there is a distinct lack of therapies targeting
metastasis. Among the major modifiable external factors known to affect CRC risk are diet and obesity; however,
unlike cancer initiation, how pro-obesity high fat diets (HFD) can impact cancer metastasis remains an essential
question. Our understanding of the biology of metastatic cells is significantly impeded by a lack of in-vivo CRC
models that recapitulate metastatic disease. This proposal leverages our orthotopic transplantation model of
CRC, where genetically-engineered CRC organoids harboring common mutations found in human CRC are
transplanted via colonoscopy into recipient host colons, forming tumors that later metastasize to the liver. Using
this system, we have begun to study how CRC with different driver mutations such as APC, KRAS and p53,
metastasize and adapt to the liver microenvironment in diet induced obesity. We have observed that diet induced
obesity increases CRC metastasis to the liver. Our initial single cell RNA-Sequencing analyses of the primary
colon and liver metastatic tumors have identified tumor intrinsic and extrinsic changes in response to an
obesogenic HFD. Tumor intrinsic responses to HFD include increased YAP1 signaling and tumor-specific “revival
stem cell” or revSC like populations. In our AIM1 of mentored K99 phase, using CRISPR mediated knock out
models and untargeted metabolite profiling, we will identify the role of Hippo/YAP1 signaling in tumor metastasis
and metabolic adaptations in pro-obesity HFD. In our AIM2 (K99 phase), leveraging reporter mouse models and
single cell RNA-Sequencing, we will identify the contribution of revSCs in metastatic seeding, and the role of
YAP1 regenerative signaling in mediating revSC like phenotypes in obesity. In our AIM3 of independent R00
phase, we will identify tumor extrinsic niche factors that contribute to increased metastasis in HFD. In our
preliminary single cell profiling of the tumor niche in HFD, we observe evolution of specific Spp1 and Cxcl1
expressing cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in the colon and liver metastatic niche. AIM3 will specifically
characterize the origin, role and interactions of these CAF populations. The K99 training will mainly focus on
cancer stem cell niche and modeling, single cell analyses, and tumor metabolism. This will be accomplished by
training with the primary mentor, Dr Omer Yilmaz, with expertise in intestinal stem cells and their niche, colorectal
cancer and gastrointestinal pathology, and mentoring team Dr Alex Shalek (single cell and computational
analysis), Drs Alpaslan Tasdogan and Matthew Vander Heiden (tumor metabolism) and Dr Jacqueline Lees
(cancer stem cells). This will be supplemented with conference, coursework and workshops in Metabolomics,
Metastasis and Bioinformatics, and mentorship and teaching exercises to prepare for future academic career in
the independent R00 phase. Successful completion of this study will identify mechanisms integral to initiate and
maintain metastasis, revealing targetable vulnerabilities as well as provide insights to guide dietary interventions.

 The stereochemistry of a pharmaceutical drug is of paramount importance as alternative stereoisomers
can lead to vastly completely different outcomes in its efficacy, pharmacokinetic properties, and side-effects.
Therefore, site-selective control to access the desired stereochemistry of a molecule (stereochemical editing),
especially at a late-stage, has a direct impact on drug discovery and is at the forefront of innovation in synthetic
organic chemistry. The objective of this proposed research is to develop a mild and efficient stereochemical
editing strategy for quaternary stereocenters guided by enantioselective recombination of C–C bonds.
Traditionally, stereochemical editing relies on the homolytic cleavage of a C–H bond via photoredox catalysis in
the presence of a hydrogen bond donor and a hydrogen bond abstractor. Nevertheless, this system is simply
unapplicable to quaternary stereocenters because they lack the required hydrogen bond. To overcome this
challenge, the proposed research engages an innovative application of photoredox catalysis and asymmetric
recombination of a C–C bond. The first approach will establish a dual asymmetric photoredox/nickel catalysis
strategy. This system will be applied to effect a mesolytic cleavage of a target C–C bond, followed by asymmetric
induction of a chiral nickel catalyst to promote an recombination of the C–C bond via intramolecular sp3–sp3
cross-coupling. If successful, this dual catalytic system will provide a fully stereocontrolled means to access to
the quaternary stereocenters under mild conditions. The second approach will deploy a chiral counteranion of
the photocatalyst to induce asymmetric ion-pairing with carbocationic intermediates. This method will utilize
exceptionally simple, yet underexplored conditions to recombine C–C bonds to manipulate the quaternary
stereocenters orthogonally to the previous approach. These studies are expected to enable a novel mode of
action toward stereochemical editing of quaternary stereocenters and have applications, such as epimerization,
racemization, and deracemization, in the discovery of pharmaceuticals, natural product synthesis, as well as
derivatization of the existing drugs.
 The proposed research aligns well with my future development plan to broaden my expertise in modern
methodology by ensuring exposure to the development of new techniques in photoredox and transition metal
catalysis with mechanistic and kinetic studies. The Wendlandt lab’s extensive experience and expertise in
photoredox catalysis, coupled with the state-of-the-art resources and facilities at MIT, provides the optimal
environment to pursue and successfully execute the proposed research.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a multisystem autoimmune disorder characterized by a loss of tolerance
to multiple endogenous antigens, for which there is no cure. Current therapeutic options for SLE patients involve
a variety of non-specific immunosuppressive or anti-inflammatory agents that have significant associated side
effects and are often inadequate. There is thus a great unmet need to develop curative therapies for this disease.
In SLE, tissue injury is often mediated by aberrant expression of immunoregulatory signaling proteins. In
particular, Src homology region 2 domain-containing phosphatase-2 (SHP-2) has been shown to enhance
disease-active T cell proliferation and promote downstream cytokine production, each of which are innately tied
to the pathophysiology of the disease. The importance of this phosphatase in the promotion of SLE has been
further demonstrated by its inhibition, wherein systemic treatment normalized many of the symptoms of the
disease concomitant with an extension of lifespan. Yet, SHP-2 is expressed throughout the body, thus the
potential for off-target effects from systemic therapies is great. The spleen is the largest secondary lymphoid
organ and an active regulator of the immune response, with a structure designed to increase the likelihood of
rare interactions between cells, in particular cognate lymphocytes and antigen-presenting cells. While the spleen
is not considered a target organ in SLE, it is an active site for autoantibody generation and the accumulation of
pathogenic cells, including DNTCs, which are trafficked throughout the body to elicit the observed multi-organ
damage. We thus hypothesize that the localization of therapeutics to the spleen, in particular modulators of
SHP-2, may be sufficient to enable a systemic therapeutic effect. To accomplish this, we propose to utilize
engineered senescent red blood cell mimetic nanohybrids to specifically deliver small molecule inhibitors or
oligonucleotide-based therapeutics to the splenic milieu. If successful, the generated materials may potentiate
the discovery of novel therapeutic options for the treatment of SLE with the capacity for increased specificity and
decreased side effects.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Cardiomyocytes (CMs) are building blocks and function units of the heart, and their dysfunction or loss
is the root of heart failure. Similar with other specialized innate immune cells, CMs have their own
innate immune molecular machinery. Ischemic or non-ischemic pathological stress activates CM
innate immune signaling pathways, which stimulate pro-inflammatory cytokine release and reactive
oxygen species (ROS) production. These innate immune responses are beneficial for defending CMs
against pathogen invasion and for tissue repair, but can also cause myocardial damage. The ultimate
goal of this project is to define new molecular mechanisms that regulate CM innate immune
responses, which will shed light on the pathogenesis of pathogen or non-pathogen related
cardiomyopathy. Damage/danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) initiate innate immune
responses by binding to pattern recognition receptors, and one of the best-characterized signaling axis
is TLR4/NF-kB pathway. The Hippo-YAP pathway is crucial for heart development and cardiac
regeneration, and disturbances in Hippo-YAP have been implicated in a range of heart diseases.
IRF2BP2 (interferon regulatory factor 2 binding protein 2) is a transcription co-factor little studied in the
heart. We recently found that YAP regulates CM innate immune responses by blunting TLR4/NF-kB
signaling, and that IRF2BP2 is crucial for restraining TLR4 expression in the heart. In this project, we
will test the hypothesis that YAP and IRF2BP2 are suppressors of CM innate immune responses. We
propose the following two aims. Aim 1. Define the role of YAP in CM innate immune responses. In this
aim, we will determine whether YAP regulation of CM innate immune responses depends on its
transcriptional activity. Additionally, we will develop a novel YAP modRNA delivery system. We
previously showed that transiently activating YAP with intra-myocardial delivered aYAP modRNA
reduced heart injury. However, the in situ delivery method limits aYAP modRNA's clinical application.
Here, we will test the efficacy of CM targeted and nano-particle packaged aYAP modRNA in a murine
cardiac ischemia/reperfusion model. Aim 2. Define the role of IRF2BP2 in CM innate immune
responses. In this aim, we will perform IRF2BP2 gain- and loss-of-function studies to define its role in
CM innate immune responses. Additionally, we will investigate the molecular mechanism of how
IRF2BP2 regulates CM innate immune responses. Using the new Irf2bp2 knock-in mouse line we
have recently generated, we will perform IRF2BP2 ChIP-Seq to identify its direct targets. This proposal
is innovative and significant, as it focuses on dissecting the basic molecular mechanisms that underlie
CMs innate immune responses, and it aims to develop new therapeutic strategies for reducing
myocardial infarction injury.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) remains the most commonly occurring cardiac arrhythmia. It is associated with a lower
quality of life and a higher rate of morbidity and mortality primarily due to poor hemodynamic performance and
often stroke. One of the primary options to treat AF is cardiac ablation where the physician applies radiofrequency
energy via percutaneous catheters to form a series of lesions that directly destroys or isolates abnormal sources
of electrical activity. Specific to AF ablation, a series of lesions are created to encircle the pulmonary veins
forming an electrical barrier that isolates the arrhythmogenic foci inside the vein from the rest of the heart.
However, while attempting to form lesion sets, the physician inadvertently leaves viable gaps that can be
extremely difficult to detect, especially when the tissue is electrically stunned but remains metabolically viable.
When this happens, these gaps will heal over time and reconduct the abnormal electrical activity to the rest of
the heart, causing high post-procedural recurrence rates. As such, there is a strong clinical need to identify these
gaps. Unfortunately, to date there are limited means for real-time monitoring of tissue injury and gap detection
during ablation procedures and there are no means of directly detecting permanently damaged cardiac tissue.
Here we propose to commercialize a new generation of percutaneous catheters that can distinguish viable from
ablated cardiac tissue by sensing, in real time, spectral changes in tissue autofluorescence profiles caused by
thermal damage. During the Phase II we produced and tested in live animals two versions of catheters, one that
acquires an optical signature from a single fiber at the point where catheter tip touches the tissue, and a more
complex version capable of hyperspectral imaging. This Phase IIB proposal seeks NIH funding to help
commercialize the first optically enabled therapeutic ablation catheters under the trade name OmniView™. The
first major task of the proposal to do so will be to manufacture 270 catheters and 20 instruments to be used for
V&V testing and the subsequent clinical trial. These catheters and the instruments will undergo extensive V&V
safety testing based upon standards outlined in the proposal. GLP live animal testing will be conducted in the
large-animal porcine model. Following successful V&V testing, we will prepare an Investigational Device
Exemption document set for submission to the FDA in order to receive permission to begin the clinical trial. We
have identified five hospital sites with highly regarded electrophysiologists who are eager to participate. We have
also held initial meetings with the FDA to obtain feedback on clinical strategy and have identified a CRO for
clinical trial oversight. We will then perform the clinical trial as the key step towards commercialization. In
summary, there remains an unmet clinical need for a system that can distinguish, in real-time, healthy versus
ablated myocardial tissue with high resolution in order to identify and ablate gaps between lesions. Our new
generation of percutaneous catheters and instruments is capable of acquiring tissue autofluorescence profiles
during the ablation procedure therefore assisting physicians in providing better care.

Advanced maternal age at the time of reproduction decreases offspring lifespan and health in a range of species,
including humans. The mechanisms controlling maternal age effects on offspring are unknown, however.
Mitochondria are prone to damage and dysfunction with age and are maternally inherited, suggesting they may
play a role in intergenerational maternal effects on offspring health. Our work shows that offspring from older
mothers have shorter lifespan, lower reproduction, decreased health, and altered behavior relative to young-
mother offspring. We found that these changes are associated with higher mtDNA per cell, more mitochondria,
larger mitochondria, decreased mitochondrial intermembrane area, lower oxidative potential, lower ATP content,
and altered reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. Our results and the literature on mitochondria in aging led to
our hypothesis that mitochondrial dysfunction in advanced maternal age causes accumulation of dysfunctional
mitochondria in offspring through compensatory biogenesis and decreased autophagy during development. This
disrupts offspring mitochondrial function and mitochondrial-nuclear communication, leading to accelerated
offspring aging. The objective of this project is to understand the mitochondrial mechanisms by which maternal
age determines offspring aging. In this study, we will: (1) identify the maternal mitochondrial mechanisms that
trigger maternal age effects; (2) identify the developmental mechanisms causing accumulation of mtDNA and
damaged mitochondria in old-mother offspring; and (3) identify the offspring mitochondrial mechanisms involved
in negative maternal age effects and determine if these mechanisms are ROS-dependent. This work will be
accomplished using qPCR and RNA-Seq to quantify mtDNA and controls on metabolism, signaling, and
dynamics; imaging to quantify mitochondrial ultrastructure and mitophagy, and pharmacological and RNAi
manipulation of maternal and offspring mitochondria to test mechanisms. We will use biochemical, respirometry,
and imaging approaches to measure mitochondrial efficiency. Additional biochemical and imaging approaches
will be used to quantify ROS and cellular damage. We will use lifetable experiments to measure lifespan and
reproduction in response to maternal age or mechanistic tests. Studies will be on both female and male offspring.
Our study system is the rotifer Brachionus manjavacas—a short-lived, aquatic, microscopic invertebrate with
unique advantages as a model for investigating maternal age effects. Our approach will identify the cellular
mechanisms by which advanced maternal age causes accumulation of mtDNA and damaged mitochondria in
offspring; changes offspring mitochondrial dynamics, structure, and function; and decreases offspring fitness. If
successful, this research will advance the field by revealing drivers of accelerated aging in offspring due to
maternal age effects and by identifying mechanisms underlying a poorly understood cause of interindividual
variability in healthspan and lifespan. Our findings will have implications for understanding age-related changes
in female fertility and for identifying potential targets for treatment of age-related dysfunction.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
To overcome the “undruggable” protein problem, researchers have turn to drugging mRNAs that
translate into these undruggable proteins or non-coding RNAs that regulate the biogenesis of
these proteins. Avenues of controlling RNA degradation include induced proximity degradation or
splicing modulated nonsense-mediated decay (NMD). Induced proximity degradation is a strategy
where a bifunctional drug binds a target RNA via a small molecule (SM) entity on one arm and
induces selective RNA degradation via a ribonuclease on the other arm. Therapeutic modulation
of NMD via RNA splicing is another strategy to selectively control RNA degradation. Early-stage
RNA degradation drug discovery has been hindered by current high-throughput screening (HTS)
assay technologies designed for protein targets. Specifically, cell-based drug screens use
minigene reporters that rely on luciferase or fluorescent protein signals for assay read-out.
Minigene reporter design is straightforward but minigene reporter requires mRNA export to the
cytosol and protein translation. This significantly increases the rate of false hits per screen since
compounds that inhibit global protein translation machinery or RNA export will also impact
reporter read-out. Further, protein-based reporters cannot be used to study nuclear RNA or non-
coding RNA turnover, and in diseases with nuclear export defects. Thus, there is an unmet need
for a cell-based HTS assay platform that monitors selected RNA turnover directly, reflects real-
time RNA dynamics, and compatible for different types of RNA. A prime example where a
previously intractable disease can be unlocked by RNA degrading drugs is the G4C2
hexanucleotide repeat expansion in the C9orf72 gene – the most frequent genetic cause of
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). It is now known that the
toxic gain-of-function from the expanded G4C2 repeats induces ALS/FTD pathology. Antisense
oligonucleotides (ASOs) designed to bind either the G4C2 sequences or intronic regions
downstream of the repeat sequences showed reduction in disease phenotypes in C9orf72 models.
However, ASOs can trigger immune responses and suffer from tissue delivery issues. A cell-
based assay that can report expanded transcript turnover to identify effective C9orf72 RNA gain-
of-function SM inhibitors will have high commercial potential. The goals of this Phase I SBIR
application will be cell-based RNA degradation reporters for validated RNA targets in
neurodegenerative diseases. The results will form the foundation of an HTS assay platform for
early-stage discovery SMs that modulate RNA stability.

Aggregation of -synuclein throughout the neuron, including at synapses, is a pathological hallmark of
Parkinson’s disease (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and variants of Alzheimer’s disease (AD).
Synaptic aggregation of -synuclein is strongly associated with cognitive deficits and dementia in PD
and DLB. The long-term goal of this project is to identify the cellular and molecular mechanisms that
give rise to -synuclein-induced synaptic deficits and to develop strategies for reversing them. While it
is generally agreed that -synuclein accumulation at synapses impairs synaptic vesicle trafficking, the
underlying mechanisms remain unclear, preventing the development of treatments for improving
synaptic function in PD and DLB. Over the last decade, we developed and implemented lamprey
reticulospinal synapses as a new model for studying how -synuclein accumulation impacts synapse
structure and function. Our lab was the first to discover that acutely introducing excess -synuclein to
synapses, mimicking increased expression in PD and DLB, inhibits synaptic vesicle endocytosis. This
result was subsequently corroborated at mammalian synapses. We then discovered that different
molecular species of -synuclein (e.g. monomers vs. dimers) cause distinct impacts on endocytosis,
emphasizing the need to understand how each species affects synaptic vesicle trafficking and the
underlying mechanisms. Experiments proposed in the parent award will significantly advance the field
by: determining how post-translational modifications of -synuclein alter its effects at synapses (Aim 1);
identifying how -synuclein oligomers purified from human PD and DLB brains affect synapses (Aim
2); and examining the underlying mechanisms with selective inhibitors of -synuclein membrane
binding and oligomerization (Aim 3). Experiments proposed in this post-baccalaureate diversity
supplement application expand the Aims of the parent award to include the impacts of these -
synuclein variants on synaptic mitochondria. The project is significant because it will substantially
increase our understanding of the impacts of excess -synuclein on synapses and local mitochondria,
including pathology-associated strains.

This proposal, entitled "Zebrafish Development and Genetics", requests support for an intensive two-week
laboratory and lecture course held at the Marine Biological Laboratory (MBL) for advanced graduate students,
postdoctoral fellows and independent investigators that focuses on the development and genetics of zebrafish,
with special emphasis on the mechanistic basis of embryogenesis, organogenesis, and regeneration. In its
24th year, the MBL Zebrafish course is still the only one of its kind worldwide, covering time-proven and newly-
developed technologies and their applications in zebrafish. Mornings and afternoons are devoted primarily to
laboratory exercises punctuated with interactive workshops, while the evenings are typically spent on data
evaluation, lectures by leading figures in the international zebrafish community, and discussions.
During the first week of the course, students learn concepts and techniques that are crucial for most zebrafish
laboratories working on embryos and larvae: staging and anatomy, microscopy, microinjection, in situ
hybridization, immunohistochemistry and imaging. Emphasis is placed on best practices for achieving rigor and
reproducibility using each approach. The first week also focuses on genetics, with workshops covering genome
editing and web-based genomics resources. The second week focuses on development and function of
various organ systems, including concepts and techniques related to specific developmental disorders and
tissue regeneration. Having been introduced to embryonic, larval, and adult anatomy in week one, students
then learn techniques for labeling, ablating and transplanting cells to assess cell fate, morphogenesis and
regeneration. Emphasis is placed on high-resolution live imaging of fluorescent transgenic reporters, including
quantitative approaches for tracking cell movement and cell shape changes. Additionally, the course teaches
techniques for studying larval visual and locomotor behaviors, including the genes and neural circuits involved.
Throughout the two-week course, laboratory sessions are interspersed with workshop-style roundtable
discussions that cover practical aspects of zebrafish research (e.g. when to select fish as a model organism,
best practices in fish husbandry) and discuss the latest developments in the field (e.g. strategies for disease
modeling, single cell "-omics"). Finally, each of the course faculty presents a lecture centered on their current
research. These highly interactive seminars are considered to be a highlight of the course, as they frequently
nucleate engaging discussions about outstanding biological questions that extend well into the evening.
The MBL Zebrafish course has received rave reviews from previous trainees. It strives both for scientific
excellence as well as to train a diverse and inclusive group of scientists joining the zebrafish community. It is
carefully crafted to provide newcomers to the zebrafish field with training in essential techniques and cutting-
edge strategies used in this system. In addition, by facilitating interactions with leading figures in zebrafish
research, the course creates a fruitful ground for its students to network and develop enduring collaborations.

Corneal disease is one of the leading causes of visual deficiency and blindness, and is considered the second
major cause of blindness in developing countries. There are nearly 5 million bilaterally corneal blind persons
worldwide, and an estimated 23 million people affected by unilateral corneal blindness globally. In a conservative
estimate, corneal diseases affect nearly 300,000 people in the United States, with Fuchs’ dystrophy affecting
4% of people aged over 40. Given the large prevalence of corneal disease and the near-impossibility of
performing biopsy, high-definition corneal imaging is needed to assist clinical diagnosis, evaluate progression of
diseases, and treatment. Additionally, the cornea is the most commonly transplanted tissue worldwide.
Gabor-domain optical coherence microscopy (GDOCM) is a high-resolution, non-invasive imaging technology
that can visualize microscopic structures in vivo in 3D. Preliminary data suggest that GDOCM has the following
key advantages over existing corneal imaging techniques, which include specular and confocal microscopy: 1)
10-100x increase in field of view – this will lead to more accurate qualification of the corneal tissue, since a larger
area can be assessed; 2) simultaneous measure of corneal thickness, quantification of endothelial cell density,
as well as identification of morphological variations due to corneal disease – this will lead to full corneal evaluation
in one instrument; 3) 3D imaging capability at the cellular level of the mosaic of translucent corneal cells – this
will enable a detailed understanding the volumetric progression of the diseases.
We have assembled an exceptionally strong team of clinical investigators to collaborate on this proposal, and
with their help we have identified four use cases for clinical application of our dual-imaging technology to image
the cornea with volumetric cellular-resolution. We envision that in the future the dual OCT (optical coherence
tomography) and GDOCM instrument enabled by this Phase II SBIR proposal will provide an image-guidance
method to assist clinicians in the assessment and treatment of corneal diseases and other diseases affecting
the anterior segment of the eye, including diabetes and glaucoma.

Fluorescence anisotropy (or polarization) is routinely used for investigating
interactions at high resolution in cellular environments. This imaging approach is
in onjunction with TIRF, confocal or epi-illumination and lately there have been efforts to
i t with lightsheet. Among the available fluorescence imaging modalities, lightsheet is
a method of choice for 3D imaging of live samples because of its fast-imaging speed
 gentleness. We ropose to leverage our experience in building lightsheet systems and
polarization optics to advance the field of fluorescence polarization i maging. Our aim
 this proposal i s to combine these two modalities in a manner such that it can easily be
and used for biological applications and quantitative analysis. Our previous research has
 a specifically designed Wollaston prism for imaging single color fluorescence anisotropy. In
 application, we propose to build a dual-color optical splitter for fluorescence polarization
 which will employ the Wollaston prism for polarization separation and a single area
 such as sCMOS camera (Aim 1a). Fabricated nanostructured pinhole arrays will be
 to characterize the optical splitter for field dependent distortions, transmission losses in
 channels (due to various optical components), and to validate the registration of multi-
 for polarization computation. We will also combine this splitter with the home-built
systems for 3D live imaging of cells and embryos (Aim 1b). A tailored image analysis
along with a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) will be developed for data
and quantitative image analysis (Aim 2). Our proposed approach would allow us t o map
anisotropy for investigating protein-protein interactions in 3D in live samples.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
Recording whole-brain activity with single neuron resolution and millisecond timescale precision is crucial to
understanding how individual cells and complex neural circuits interact in both time and space. Simultaneous
recording and stimulation of large populations of neurons distributed throughout the brain are needed to
rigorously evaluate theories of neural computation at the cellular level in mammals, and extended longitudinal
recordings are required to establish general principles for neuronal circuits/dynamics and how complex
neuronal activity relates to behavior, both to further our fundamental understanding of the brain, but also to
surface underlying causes of neurological and psychiatric conditions such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, TBI,
epilepsy, and depression, and to aid development of novel and more effective treatments.
These are key goals of the BRAIN initiative, and the driving force behind LeafLabs' Willow, an
electrophysiology recording system designed to take advantage of novel, close-packed 1000-channel silicon
probes originally developed by the Synthetic Neurobiology Group at MIT. These ultra-high-channel-count
probes allow for more neurons to be recorded simultaneously, opening up new lines of scientific inquiry, and
the dense packing of the electrodes permits spatial oversampling of the neurons, allowing for automated spike
sorting techniques with greatly increased capability for tracking individual units.
Additionally, LeafLabs' Catkin, a custom 1000 channel neurosensing IC chip (filter, amplification, multiplexing,
and analog-digital conversion) has been developed to integrate with these probes, resulting in a
probe/headstage combo suitable for use in freely-moving electrophysiology experiments that reduces size,
weight, and cost each by a factor of 10 compared to commercially available headstages. Currently, the Catkin
probe/headstage combo is tethered to the Willow DAQ system by an ultra thin and lightweight cable (a single
shielded 32 AWG twisted pair), resulting in a system ideal for many prolonged freely moving experiments.
However, in certain behavioral setups, even a lightweight, minimalist cable is undesirable. For example,
because the high data rates are incompatible with approaches used to manage the cable tether
(commutators), researchers must occasionally intervene to de-tangle cables; or, the presence of a tether may
result in altered behavior from animals. To address these needs, this application proposes the development of
a first-of-its-kind fully untethered 1000-channel-simultaneous 30kHz in-vivo electrophysiological
recording module, to be made available as a lightweight add-on to the extant Willow system.

Combining live imaging with single-cell sequencing is a powerful approach for gaining comprehensive
understanding of individual cell behaviors within complex biological systems. However, existing
approaches are limited in throughput, rely on computational data alignments that are prone to bias, or
require analysis of isolated cells. The goal of this Fast-Track SBIR application is to develop a novel cellular
barcoding technology that will enable researchers to conduct both standard live-cell imaging and high-
throughput single-cell sequencing, and then align the two sets of data unambiguously according to the cell
barcodes. The proposed approach uses dual-barcoded laser particles (LPs) with unique pairs of optical
emission spectra and oligonucleotide sequences. These barcodes can be identified either optically during
imaging or by single-cell sequencing. Built on promising preliminary data, Phase I of this project aims to
demonstrate the feasibility of dual-barcoded LPs on a small scale. Upon success of Phase I, Phase II will
streamline and scale up the fabrication of the LPs and test and validate the technology towards
commercialization. The optical barcode readout requires a high-resolution spectrometer and a pump laser.
In Phase II, add-on hardware modules and cell-tracking software will be developed and tested to be
compatible with existing commercial microscopes, making it easier for researchers to adopt the technology.
Additionally, Phase II research aims to demonstrate the usefulness of imaging-sequencing data via a pilot
study of cancer cells. Furthermore, potential risks and solutions for the technology will be explored,
including the long-term effects of LPs on cell gene expression patterns. Overall, the outcome of this Fast-
Track project will be significant technological advancements to the field of single-cell analysis for both basic
research and drug discovery.

(Fayer et al., 2017). Additionally, Women, Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC), and people with disabilities
are underrepresented as both students and professionals in STEM fields (Rotermund & Burke, 2021; Hamrick, 2021). To
address the dire need to prepare students with key skills like communication and collaboration, and increase interest in
health and medicine careers especially among BIPOC, Killer Snails, a science-focused educational technology company,
will create VenomSquad, an augmented reality (AR) learning experience for 6-8th grade.
 We will foster an interest in STEM and future careers by creating an AR experience using mobile phones
where students take on roles as scientists working collaboratively in teams to understand how venom can be used
to make therapeutic drugs. VenomSquad will be a 5-day curriculum supplement that combines AR game play, an
interactive web-based digital science journal that reflects student interactions, and an innovative assessment dashboard for
educators which highlights student collaboration across platforms. In VenomSquad students will take on roles of scientists
collaboratively solving a real-world problem: finding new, non-addictive pain therapies based on the venom of extreme
creatures like snakes and cone snails. While the content we propose for VenomSquad is unique, the underlying technology
and principles of multimedia design for learning are generalizable to other content areas.
 VenomSquad has three innovative features: (1)Technical advancements in collaborative mobile AR. The
creation of VenomSquad will require new technical advancements (addressing bandwidth, latency, loss of connection) to
ensure a high level of collaboration for the student teams using AR. (2)Multiplayer design engine. The proprietary design
engine powering the digital science journal enables collaborative behaviors like communication and sharing resources
between students with different information based on their roles, while maintaining common ground within the group.
(3)Educator dashboard optimized for timely, contextual feedback. We will create an educator dashboard to display
actionable learning analytics drawn from qualitative and quantitative information about individual student work and
collaborative interactions between students in the digital science journal and the AR scenes. This display will highlight
evidence of successful collaboration or the need for support from the educator. This feature of the dashboard will help
educators assess each student and group’s AR and digital experience, addressing pain points for educators using
collaborative activities in classroom settings. Taken together, these features ensure VenomSquad will be unlike existing
Life/Physical Science materials on the market and will create a niche in which Killer Snails can grow.
 Our iterative approach to the design and testing of VenomSquad will examine how these features contribute to
students’ learning experiences. Our evaluation partner WestEd will conduct an RCT examining the extent to which
VenomSquad can affect students’ use of science and engineering practices, especially ability to effectively collaborate, and
interest in STEM careers, and educators’ ability to monitor and support students during collaborative activities.

The overall objective of the proposed project is to investigate brain mechanisms during learning in individuals
with traumatic brain injury (TBI) with and without clinical depression. Such knowledge can help guide rehabilita-
tion strategies and reduce the burden of TBI. Feedback about the accuracy of one’s actions can improve learn-
ing by informing individuals whether their action is correct or not. Individuals with depression have been shown
to have learning deficits and altered brain activity during learning compared to healthy individuals when feed-
back is presented immediately. Impaired learning through immediate feedback has also been observed in Par-
kinson’s disease (PD) patients. However, PD patients are able to learn from feedback when it is presented af-
ter a delay through engagement of separate neural mechanisms. We show that individuals with TBI exhibit def-
icits in learning through immediate feedback that are likely exacerbated by depressive symptoms. Deficits in
learning through immediate feedback can lead to perseveration of incorrect actions and decreased strategy
use during rehabilitation. However, there is no evidence directly examining the neural mechanisms of learning
in individuals with TBI with and without depression. The proposed research fills this gap. The identification of
the neural mechanisms associated with learning in individuals with TBI with and without clinical depression will
inform 1) scientific knowledge about the effect of depression on the injured brain, 2) TBI interventions about the
effectiveness of feedback and its timing, and 3) the development of generalized interventions for other clinical
populations that require rehabilitation and have high occurrence of depression. These objectives lie at the
heart of the mission of the NINDS as they will broaden “fundamental knowledge about the brain and nervous
system” associated with learning in TBI. The knowledge gained from fulfilling the above objectives will “reduce
the burden” of learning deficits after TBI. To test our hypotheses, TBI participants will be recruited based on
structured clinical interview. Qualified participants will perform an experiment where they study word pairs out-
side of the functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner. Then, in the MRI, participants will see word
pairs in multiple-choice format, along with novel distractors, and select the correct paired-associate. After each
choice, feedback will be experimentally manipulated to be presented either immediately or after a 25-minute
delay. During the final phase outside of the MRI, participants complete a second diagnostic paired-associate
multiple-choice assessment to evaluate the influence of immediate vs. delayed feedback on learning. We hy-
pothesize that depressed individuals with TBI will show improvements in learning from delayed compared to
immediate feedback. This learning dissociation will occur because learning through delayed feedback relies on
neurocircuitry that is not negatively affected by TBI and depression. Non-depressed individuals without TBI
and clinically depressed individuals without TBI will also be recruited to differentiate the influences of depres-
sion from the impact of TBI on the brain.

 Promoting recovery of motor function in stroke is an essential medical and economic target. Despite significant
advances in activity- and technology-based interventions, the field still fails to achieve the same level of recovery
in all patients. This failure could be due to the delay in administering massed practice training until patients gain
significant volitional movement, which can be weeks after stroke. Maladaptive plasticity could occur during this
time and challenges the therapeutic effect of rehabilitation interventions. Exoskeleton Walking Robots (ERs) can
provide assistance during walking training, and allow administering high dosage training early-on after stroke
The primary hypothesis of this proposal is that the earlier the commence of high-dosage gait therapy, the better
is the chance of inducing plasticity and recovery. In aim 1, investigators propose to compare the effect of
progressive, long duration (30 hours over 10 weeks), ER assist-as-needed walking training (ERASSIST) versus
standard of care (SOC) administered during the acute phase of a stroke on functional recovery and
neuromuscular activation. Participants will be randomly assigned to each group, and investigators will examine
the effect of each intervention on functional recovery and modulation of neuromuscular activations during
walking. They hypothesize that early administration of intensive walking training using ER assistance can lead
to significant increase in dosage, and a renormalization in walking function and neuromuscular activation during
walking. In aim 2, investigators will acquire longitudinal measures of structural and resting-state functional MRI
connectivity at 4 time-points: within 1 month of stroke, before and after 10 weeks of ERASSIST or SOC intervention,
and at 6 months post stroke. Data will be used to model prognoses of recovery and compare the effect of ERASSIST
and SOC interventions on improving the prognosis of recovery. In aim 3, investigators propose to study
reorganization in cortico-muscular connectivity (CMC) post-stroke and over the course of functional recovery
and compare it to gender- and age-matched healthy controls. Static CMC will be evaluated using transcranial
magnetic stimulation to record ipsilesional primary motor cortex excitability and recruitment curve slope. Dynamic
CMC will be explored using mobile imaging (EEG) and wireless EMG techniques to measure cortico-muscular
coherence during walking. The objective of comparing stroke and healthy controls CMC data is to understand if
the reorganization of CMC is an adaptation to stroke or a re-normalization to a healthy pattern of connectivity.
Investigators assume that participants with high functional recovery will show a re-normalization of CMC toward
more similarity with age- and gender-matched healthy controls. This research will have a significant impact on
“determining optimal combination and “dosing” of individual interventions to improve, and possibly accelerate
recovery following injury” by “examining the underpinnings of plasticity, adaptation, and response to injury and
rehabilitation intervention.”

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Close to 2.5 million Americans are currently living with post-stroke aphasia, a debilitating communication disorder
affecting multiple language modalities. Most stroke survivors with aphasia have acquired reading deficits, which
persist chronically and severely limit life participation and autonomy. There is an urgent need for effective
treatments grounded in stroke neurobiology which yield robust functional improvements. Treatments targeting
impaired reading processes and aimed at restoring cerebral blood flow (CBF) can meet this need by directly
remediating dysfunctional brain mechanisms. In the proposed R01 we will combine aerobic exercise training
(AET) with an intensive phono-motor reading treatment (PMT). Our central hypothesis is that a single bout of
aerobic exercise will increase CBF and oxygenation, and if delivered before a PMT session, will facilitate
treatment-induced neuroplasticity, strengthening damaged phonological networks and leading to robust
functional improvements over time. We and others found that reduced CBF in parts of the left hemisphere outside
the stroke lesion persists for weeks to months after a stroke and predicts more severe language deficits and
worse recovery. Phonological processing, or the ability to derive sound structure of words, critical to so many
language modalities, is consistently impaired in left-hemisphere stroke survivors with aphasia and reding deficits.
We expect that the proposed treatment targeting both the impaired CBF, and phonological deficits will markedly
increase treatment effectiveness and enhance generalization to untrained language modalities. We will test our
central hypothesis by pursuing three specific aims. Under Aim 1, we will determine if combined AET and PMT
improve language outcomes by carrying out a randomized controlled trial in 70 individuals with chronic left-
hemisphere stroke. Participants will complete either 20 minutes of moderate aerobic exercise or light stretching
prior to each session of intensive PMT. We expect that while both groups should improve, the AET group will
show more robust language improvements after 40 sessions of combined AET+PMT. Under Aims 2-3, we will
study both the immediate and sustained impact of AET and PMT on brain function using 3 MRI scans,
administered before the intervention, after the initial aerobic exercise session, and after the full course of AET +
PMT treatment. We expect that aerobic exercise will have an immediate positive impact on CBF and resting
state functional connectivity, as well as induce a sustained improvement in these measures and in task-related
brain activity compared to the pre-intervention baseline. While each of these interventions in isolation has shown
positive impact on stroke recovery, the proposed project will test if AET promotes acquisition and retention of
therapy skills when adjuvant to PMT. This has the potential to radically change how these treatments are applied,
increasing their effectiveness, and ultimately improving the lives of 2.5 million Americans living with stroke-
related aphasia. In addition, it is likely that the results will contribute to the understanding of stroke recovery
mechanisms thereby fundamentally advancing the field of neurorehabilitation.

There is a worldwide need for improved treatment of systemic, life-threatening fungal infections.
Current therapies are limited by the small number of approved drugs, toxicities, drug-drug
interactions, mode of administration, and growing problems of drug resistance and emerging
pathogens. Treatment also suffers from a lack of rapid clinical diagnoses, leading to dependence
on broad-spectrum antifungal drugs. Moreover, existing antifungal drug classes target membrane
and cell wall integrity, and there is a need to develop drugs against targets with new modes of
action to minimize cross resistance. Available evidence suggests dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR)
might be one such target. Commercial DHFR inhibitors are available for other therapeutic
indications (immunology, oncology, antibacterial, antiparasitic). Bactrim® is the only available
DHFR inhibitor for fungal infections but has a very narrow spectrum of activity (Pneumocystis
jirovecii and Paracoccidioides spp.), despite DHFR being an essential enzyme that is highly
conserved in fungal pathogens. As demonstrated in the current work, Candida spp., Aspergillus
spp., Cryptococcus spp., rare molds, Mucorales and dermatophytes are susceptible to DHFR
inhibition, and the DHFR mechanism of action is complementary to the targets of existing
antifungals. Fungal DHFR inhibitors have been identified that inhibit the enzyme selectively and
fungal cell growth in vitro, and fungal DHFRs differ in structure sufficiently from human DHFR
indicating that development of selective DHFR drugs is feasible. The specific aims of this Fast
Track proposal are to (1) reduce serum antagonism of our initial fungal DHFR inhibitors and
demonstrate in vivo efficacy, (2) optimize a lead fungal DHFR compound or series to select a
potential development candidate and (3) validate a fungal DHFR lead (or leads) and select a
single candidate for IND-enabling studies. The approach will enable a robust lead optimization
program to accomplish the aims and will include analog synthesis and computational chemistry,
biochemical, structural, and modeling studies, whole-cell assays, in vivo models (i.e., efficacy,
pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic) and in vitro ADME/Safety profiling to synthesize and test
inhibitors against fungal and human DHFR enzymes, fungal pathogens, and mammalian cells.
The outcomes will advance this program into IND-enabling studies (Phase IIB). The long-term
objective is to develop fungal-selective DHFR inhibitors into a new class of broad-spectrum
antifungal drugs.

Preeclampsia (PE), a pregnancy-specific condition characterized by hypertension and other organ system
dysfunction, is a major contributor to worldwide morbidity and mortality for both the mother and offspring.
During PE, pregnant individuals may experience life-threatening complications and they harbor lifelong risks for
cardiovascular disease, while the offspring may experience complications related to prematurity. High-quality
evidence supports the use of low-dose aspirin to reduce the risk of PE in those at high-risk, and emerging data
suggests that tighter blood pressure control may also mitigate the risks. Identification of pregnancies at
high-risk, however, currently relies on crude assessment of clinical risk factors alone with poor positive
predictive values. Although screening programs outside of the United States (US) report high detection rates,
many include maternal clinical factors, serum biomarkers, and ultrasound measures. Testing of performance in
a US population has not been possible as these included metrics are not routinely measured as part of
standard prenatal care. Although PE is rooted in placental dysfunction, with aberrations, such as epigenetic
modifications, occurring early in pregnancy, the placenta remains inaccessible during pregnancy. Recent data
suggests that placental derivatives (RNA, cell-free DNA) circulating in maternal circulation can be interrogated
to understand developing pregnancy complications, including PE. Our key insight is that the sequencing data
generated via cell-free DNA based non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) for aneuploidy screening can be
leveraged to infer epigenetic signatures specific to the placenta. With testing of over 1000 samples, we have
found that epigenetic signatures (in this case, nucleosome positioning) can be reliably inferred based on
available sequencing data, and that machine learning modeling can be used to predict early-onset PE. In the
proposed studies, Kanona, Inc and collaborators will build upon this work to refine/correct technical and
analytic variables, perform validation on a separate and distinct cohort, and optimize the methodology for PE
risk classification from cfDNA through sequencing of placental samples and deeper sequencing of first
trimester cfDNA samples. With the studies proposed here, and follow-up phase II external validation studies,
Kanona, Inc. will develop a test for PE prediction that can be easily performed in conjunction with cell-free DNA
based NIPT without the need for additional blood samples or dedicated laboratory workflows. This has the
potential to significantly alter the landscape of prenatal care, providing an element of precision medicine with
potentially actionable information that can prompt initiation of interventions or tailored monitoring programs to
ultimately decrease the incidence and potentially severity of PE.

Rising obesity has led to an unprecedented increase in pre-diabetes (preD) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) incidence
in children and adolescents, a worrisome trend amplified by the COVID 19 pandemic. Based on current evidence,
it remains difficult to predict whether children and adolescents with preD will progress to T2D. Our proposal aims
to address key questions in the pathogenesis of T2D, focusing on modifiable risk factors. Leveraging a
collaboration between Boston Children’s Hospital, Joslin Diabetes Center, and Massachusetts General Hospital,
in partnership with community health centers in the Greater Boston area, we propose to recruit a diverse cohort
of early pubertal youth (ages 7-15, n=300) with preD, elevated BMI (≥95th percentile), a positive family history of
diabetes, and one or more additional risk factors. We propose to combine rigorous annual clinical studies with
convenient remote assessments, to gain a granular understanding of metabolic, hormonal and environmental
factors contributing to T2D pathogenesis. In Aim 1, we will test whether measures of glucose homeostasis and
beta cell function differ between youth with preD who progress to T2D versus those who revert to normoglycemia
or remain preD. We propose to analyze glycemia and beta cell function using oral GTT and incretin hormone
levels, and assessments adaptable to community settings, e.g., continuous glucose monitors and home A1c kits.
In Aim 2, we will test whether fitness level and amount of physical activity differ between youth with preD who
progress to T2D versus those who revert to normoglycemia or remain preD. We propose to evaluate fitness level
using detailed clinical assessments, including VO2 max, assessments adaptable to community settings including
grip strength, and free-living assessments using wearables and app-based activity tracking. In Aim 3, we will test
whether evolution of body composition during growth and puberty predicts progression to T2D. We propose to
analyze body composition (total and visceral fat) using DXA, and hepatic fat using echography-based
assessments, gonadal hormones, adrenal androgens, and mediators of growth hormone action, as well as
assessments adaptable to community settings, e.g., BMI and app-based dietary surveys. As secondary aims,
we propose to create a data repository to allow evaluation of social and environmental factors contributing to
T2D onset at a consortium level, with measures including social determinants of health, neighborhood and
geographic characteristics (using geocoding techniques), and the environmental exposome. We also propose
the creation of a biological repository to allow multi-omics studies to identify genomic, epigenetic, and/or
metabolomic markers for progression from preD to T2D in youth at a consortium level. We propose to collect a
rich biorepository of longitudinal samples (i.e., plasma, PBMCs, urine, stool, hair) from all participants that will
set the stage for future systems biology-driven studies. Together, these studies will permit development of a
predictive model based on variables easily measurable at the community level, which can then be applied to the
detection and treatment of youth at highest risk of T2D.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the major cause of mortality in Type 1 diabetes (T1D). Some CVD risk factors
are shared between people with T1D and Type 2 diabetes (T2D). However, differences in dyslipidemia,
severity of insulin resistance, disease onset, responses to glycemic control, and presence of autoimmunity
suggest that the pathogenesis of CVD may differ between T1D and T2D. Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is a major
risk factor for CVD in T1D; but while it occurs in 40% of those with T1D, CVD is still the major cause of
mortality in those without DN. Autoimmunity may also contribute to CVD, since the risks of atherosclerosis are
elevated in several autoimmune diseases. Understanding the pathogenesis of CVD in TID is hampered also by
the lack of comparative pathological studies of coronary vessels of aging people with T1D versus T2D and
non-diabetic subjects. Preliminary studies from the Medalist Study, a large cohort (n=1019) with >50 years of
insulin-dependent T1D, showed that while only 13% have DN, 40% exhibited significant CVD history, which
correlated with coronary artery calcium (CAC) scores by CT and myocardial dysfunction by cardiac MRI
(CMR). While >90% of Medalists possess high-risk HLA alleles for classic autoimmune T1D, 8% also have
known genes for monogenic diabetes. The Medalist biobank includes plasma/serum samples and postmortem
organ specimens (hearts with coronary vessels, aortae, kidney, pancreases and others). Pilot studies in
Medalists provide the first extensive characterizations of inflammatory and metabolomics profiles of T1D and
their associations with CAC scores and CMR parameters, which may indicate differences with published data
on T2D. Pilot morphological studies of Medalists’ coronary vessels clearly identified immune cell infiltrates,
including CD3+ T-cells. The role of autoimmunity in exacerbating atherosclerosis is clearly demonstrated by
studies using newly-created ApoE-/-/NOD mice with autoimmune diabetes closely mimicking T1D, which
exhibited significantly more atherosclerotic plaques containing elevated subsets of pro-inflammatory T-cells
and less regulatory T-cells than in non-diabetic ApoE-/-/CongNOD control mice. In this proposal, we aim to
characterize CVD in T1D by clinical, biochemical, imaging, metabolomic and pathological studies, and their
associations with autoimmunity, via comparative studies of the Medalist cohort with T2D, monogenic diabetes
and non-diabetic subjects. Our specific aims are as follows: Sp. Aim 1: To characterize atherosclerosis and
myocardial structure and function in type 1 diabetes of long duration (Joslin Medalist Study) by CVD history
and imaging, presence of autoimmunity, beta cell function, inflammatory and metabolomics markers, metabolic
control and microvascular diseases. Sp. Aim 2: To compare the plaque characteristics and composition of
immune cells, including monocytes, macrophages, B-cells and T-cells (CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells) and
subtypes of T-cells (Treg, Tfh, Th1 and Th17) in the atherosclerotic plaques of the coronary vessels and
peripheral arteries from patients with T1D, T2D, monogenic diabetes and no DM.

A large proportion of the excess CVD morbidity and mortality experienced by individuals with T1D occur in
conjunction with diabetic kidney disease (DKD), which is associated with a striking increase in the risk of
coronary artery disease (CAD) and heart failure. The latter is frequently due to the development of diabetic
cardiomyopathy – a diabetes-specific alteration of the myocardium. The etiologic links between DKD and
cardiomyopathy are not clear, but preliminary data from our group suggest a pivotal role of the kidney function
decline component of DKD rather than albuminuria. Specifically, using an MRI-derived marker of
cardiomyocyte size, we have observed that patients with T1D who are losing kidney function but still have
preserved GFR have subclinical signs of myocardial remodeling, as indicated by a larger cardiomyocyte
size and a reduction of myocardial fiber shortening during systole as compared to T1D patients with
stable kidney function. The overall goal of this collaborative proposal, which is in response to RFA-HL-21-014,
is to take advantage of the latest developments in cardiac imaging and biomarker platforms to characterize the
cardiac involvement in patients with T1D and DKD, focusing on the initial events in the development of diabetic
cardiomyopathy. “GFR Decliners” (GFR loss in the previous 3-6 years ≥3 ml/min/year, n=100) and “GFR Non-
Decliners” (n=100) with T1D and CKD stage 1-3A, along with Non-diabetic controls (n=100) of similar age and
CKD stage, will undergo a gadolinium-enhanced cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) and a gated cardiac CT
scan to quantify coronary artery calcium (CAC). Through these studies, we will address the following Specific
Aims: 1. To evaluate the presence and severity of myocardial remodeling among T1D patients and
assess its relationship with early progressive kidney function decline. Cardiomyocyte size (τic) and
interstitial fibrosis (measured as extracellular volume [ECV]) will be quantified by CMR and compared among
GFR Decliners, GFR Non-Decliners, and Non-Diabetic subjects, and also related to albuminuria and presence
and severity of CAD. 2. To assess the relative contribution of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and interstitial
fibrosis to impaired cardiac function among T1D patients. Indices of cardiac function and myocardial strain
will be derived from the CMR data and evaluated for their association with cardiomyocyte size (τic) and
interstitial fibrosis (ECV), in relation to the severity of concomitant CAD. 3. To gain insights into the disease
processes involved in the etiology of myocardial remodeling and assess whether these overlap with
those involved in the progressive kidney function decline. In targeted studies, we will focus on serum
proteins implicated in heart failure or previously associated with increased risk of GFR loss. In untargeted
studies, we will leverage the latest developments in multiplexed assays to evaluate serum protein profiles in a
systematic fashion. With the information generated by this study on hand, we will be optimally positioned to
develop new strategies and possibly new drugs to prevent CVD in T1D.

INAEDIS proposes to develop a platform technology for rapid room temperature dehydration of vaccines and
biopharmaceutical formulations using ultra-fine droplet aerosols, eliminating the need for logistically challenging
cold chain infrastructure. Some 20% of pharmaceuticals ‒ around $35B in value ‒ are estimated to be damaged
by poor temperature control during transport alone, and the challenges of maintaining cold chain during storage
and handling only add to wastage and reduced efficacy. Alarmingly, cold chain breach has been implicated in
cases of vaccine-preventable disease or even adverse events following immunization. For example, one study
reported adverse events suffered by 7% of patients administered with temperature compromised vaccines, 13%
of which were considered serious. Freeze-drying of biological formulations, which is traditional in the production
of pharmaceuticals, introduces time-consuming (1-3 days of processing), poorly scalable, energy inefficient, and
expensive batch manufacturing. Alternative spray drying methods have been explored, though this technique
remains inefficient (0.1-1 g of inhalable particulate product out of 1 kg of liquid formulation), energy intense and
poses risk of product thermal damage due to applied high drying temperatures (100-200 °C). To mitigate the
consequences of poor vaccine access and vaccine failure on population immunization, there is a clear need for
thermal stabilization of the formulations enabling robust vaccine transport and storage solutions. INAEDIS has
developed a method of Rapid Room Temperature Aerosol Dehydration (RTAD), a scalable system for
continuous dehydration of liquid pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical formulations that provides thermal
stabilization of biological drugs and eliminates the need for a cold supply chain. INAEDIS’s process can generate
aerosols with droplets that are 100x smaller (0.2-10 μm) and yield 100x more inhalable particulate product (50-
300 g) from 1 kg of liquid than existing spray drying technologies, without applying heat for drying, which mitigates
the risk of damage of thermolabile biologicals and provides a significant reduction in energy requirements.
Preliminary studies conducted with a Top 10 Pharma company have demonstrated superiority of the system
over traditional spray dryers with respect to powder dissolution, protein aggregation, particle size and size
uniformity, and inhalability of biologic formulation. Internal studies have also exhibited a 5-10x improvement in
bacteriophage survival rate. For this Phase I, INAEDIS seeks to establish the efficacy, reliability, and applicability
of RTAD. Specific aims include: 1) Demonstrate platform capabilities of the laboratory-scale RTAD process for
three major classes of bioformulations, 2) Demonstrate powder performance and shelf-life stability of produced
dehydrated formulations, and 3) Improve yield and scale up processes to establish commercial viability of the
current laboratory scale, and ramp up production capacity to a pilot scale. This will position INAEDIS for Phase
II, during which the platform will be adapted and validated on a broader spectrum of commercially relevant
biopharmaceuticals and further scaled up to meet the needs of pilot customers in the pharmaceutical industry.

Although treatment exists for late-stage diabetic retinopathy (DR) and macular edema, interventions to inhibit
DR onset and worsening, other than glycemic control, have generally not been successful. To identify novel
DR therapeutic targets, we studied Joslin 50-Year Medalists (N=1019), all of whom have type 1 diabetes
(T1D) for 50-87 years. The presence of DR protective factors is supported by a bimodal distribution of DR in
this cohort; 41% of Medalists have no-mild DR and 47% have quiescent proliferative DR (QPDR) despite no
significant difference in glycemic control. Longitudinal data for up to 60 years shows that Medalists protected
from proliferative DR (PDR) did not experience DR worsening after their first 17 years of diabetes. Mass
spectrometry of post-mortem retina and vitreous found a novel protective factor, interphotoreceptor retinol-
binding protein 3 (RBP3), to be elevated in Medalists with no-mild DR despite poor glycemic control. Our
paper in Science Transl. Medicine (2019) confirmed that RBP3 is elevated in the retina and vitreous of
Medalists with no-mild DR versus Medalists and non-Medalists with QPDR, and that RBP3 in the retina and
vitreous of diabetic individuals is lower than in non-diabetic controls. RBP3 overexpression in in vivo studies
by lentivirus subretinal injection, embryonically by transgene targeting photoreceptors or intravitreous
injection of recombinant RBP3, inhibited retinal VEGF and IL-6 expression and normalized vascular
permeability, electroretinogram changes and acellular capillaries in diabetic rodents. Mechanistic studies
showed that in Muller and endothelial cells, RBP3 binds to cell surface proteins including GLUT-1 to decrease
glucose uptake and glycolytic flux, neutralizing adverse actions of hyperglycemia. We developed a sensitive
and specific ELISA assay that showed RBP3 levels in the vitreous and serum (at 1/1000 of vitreous levels)
were correlated with each other and with DR severity, and inversely correlated with vitreous VEGF. RBP3
expression in photoreceptor cells was reduced by high glucose, possibly due to protein kinase C (PKC) δ 
activation and inhibition of serum reactive factor (SRF) transcription factor via the Akt pathway. Preliminary
studies of RBP3 subdomains show structure-function activities for inhibiting glucose uptake by binding to
GLUT-1 transporters and reducing VEGF and IL-6 expression in Muller cells. The specific aims proposed
are: Sp. Aim 1: To characterize and compare RBP3 levels in the retina, vitreous and serum as a potential
biomarker for DR in T1D and T2D patients at the Joslin Diabetes Center, with validation in the Finland
FinnDiane T1D cohort and DRCR Protocol T (T2D) cohort. Sp. Aim 2: To determine the mechanism for
hyperglycemia-induced downregulation of RBP3 expression in photoreceptors in vivo and in a photoreceptor
cell line by activation of PKCδ  and deactivation of the Akt/mTOR/S6K pathway and SRF transcription factor.
Sp. Aim 3: To define structure-function relationships between the RBP3 full length protein and its
subdomains with regard to interaction with GLUT-1 and glucose uptake in Müller and retinal endothelial cells.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：We are in the midst of a worldwide epidemic of diabetes and obesity. A central component of these disorders is insulin resistance. Insulin resistance is the product of gene-environment interactions. A recently identified major mediator of these gene-environment interactions is the gut microbiome. To begin to dissect the role of the microbiome in gene-environment interactions in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes and obesity, we have developed a novel model taking advantage of three strains of laboratory mice: C57Bl6/J and 129S1 mice from Jax (B6J and 129J) and 129S6 mice from Taconic (129T). When challenged with high fat diet (HFD), B6J mice are insulin resistant and obesity- and diabetes-prone, while 129J mice are insulin sensitive and obesity- and diabetes-resistant. 129T mice, which are similar genetically to 129J, on the other hand, gain almost as much weight as B6J mice on HFD, but remain insulin sensitive and non-diabetic, i.e., are a model of “metabolically healthy” obesity. While genetics plays a role in these phenotypic differences, the microbiome also contributes. Thus, some of these differences can be reduced or modified by breeding the mice in the same environment or by treating the mice with antibiotics to alter the microbiome. These differences in phenotype are paralleled by differences in insulin signaling at the molecular level. Importantly, the propensity to metabolic syndrome and abnormalities in insulin signaling can be transferred in part to germ-free mice by fecal transplant. Using non-targeted metabolomics, we have shown that these effects of the microbiome are associated with dramatic changes in the levels of multiple circulating metabolites, including both known and unknowns. The major goal of this project is to identify microbiota and metabolites which are altered by the changing microbiome and contribute to insulin resistance and metabolic dysregulation. The specific aims are: 1) Using our robust model of mice on three different genetic backgrounds, we will define how changes in gut microbiota, as assessed by metagenomic analysis, in response to high fat and high carbohydrate diets, as well as exercise, are related to alterations in insulin signaling and metabolic phenotype; we will also determine how host-genetics interacts with gut microbiota to affect the metabolome by microbiome transfer into mice with different genetic risk of diabetes and metabolic syndrome. 2) Define how changes in the community of microbiota and their metagenomic representation relate to changes in the plasma/cecal metabolome across all models, and how these contribute to the insulin resistance in these models. We will also integrate the metabolomics data to create complete metabolic networks. 3) Integrate metabolomic data across all models to prioritize the unknown metabolites linked to insulin resistance for identification; and determine how both the known and the newly-identified unknown metabolites linked to insulin resistance alter insulin signaling in vitro and in vivo. Together these data will allow us to define the role of the microbiome and its associated metabolome in insulin
resistance and metabolic dysregulation and how these interact with host genetics in this process.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is caused by the immune destruction of insulin producing cells in the pancreas. The
disease cannot be prevented, and the only treatment available is a life-long use of insulin injected multiple
times a day. Insulin-producing beta cells can now be generated from pluripotent stem cells in the laboratory.
This recent achievement has raised the prospect of restoring insulin production in patients by beta cell
transplantation. However, the autoimmunity underlying T1D is long-lasting and will destroy new beta cells if
they are transplanted without immunosuppression. A new therapy that protects beta cells is urgently needed
not only enable curative beta cell replacement in patients but also to prevent diabetes in individuals at risk of
developing the disease. To discover genetic targets for such a therapy, we performed a genome-wide search
using CRIPSR-Cas9 genome editing in a mouse model for T1D. This broad unbiased search identified the
gene Renalase (RNLS). Significantly, RNLS had previously been associated with the overall risk and the age-
of-onset of T1D by human genome-wide association studies (GWAS), suggesting a role for RNLS in diabetes
pathogenesis. We went on to confirm that deleting RNLS protected mouse beta cells against cellular stress
and autoimmunity. We corroborated the protective effect of RNLS deletion in human stem cell-derived beta
cells. Based on these findings, we hypothesized that a small molecule inhibitor of RNLS would also protect.
Using structure-based molecular modeling, we identified the FDA-approved drug pargyline as a potential RNLS
inhibitor. We showed that pargyline treatment replicated the protective effects of RNLS deletion, making this
drug a potential candidate for a preventive treatment for T1D. Now, we aim to better understand how RNLS
deficiency protects beta cells against cellular stress and autoimmunity. Further, we aim to more extensively
test the therapeutic potential of pargyline. To these ends, we will pursue three Specific Aims. First, we will
evaluate metabolic plasticity as a possible mechanistic basis for the protection of RNLS deficient cells. Second,
we will quantify and delineate the immunogenicity of Rnls deficient beta cells in vitro and in mouse models for
T1D. Third, we will evaluate the therapeutic utility of pargyline as a mimic of Rnls deletion, both at the cellular
level and in the context of autoimmune diabetes in mice. Completing the first two Aims will help explain the
mechanism by which RNLS modifies beta cell vulnerability and the risk of type 1 diabetes. The third Aim will
support the translation of our discoveries into a clinical application by testing the therapeutic value of drug we
identified as a RNLS inhibitor. Our research team is composed of experts in immunology, beta cell biology and
stem cell differentiation. We are ideally positioned to explore the role of RNLS in T1D from perspectives that
range from cellular biology to systemic autoimmunity, with the prospect of improving our understanding of
disease pathology and developing a preventive drug. Our research will utilize both a well characterized mouse
model for T1D and human beta cells to ascertain the relevance of our findings for human disease.

The overall hypothesis of this project is that regular physical exercise in mothers is critical for the prevention of
type 2 diabetes and metabolic disease in offspring. Our mouse studies establish that maternal exercise before
and during pregnancy has striking beneficial effects on the metabolic health of both male and female offspring.
These findings have opened a new area of exercise physiology research, suggesting that exercise is an
important tool to combat the development of type 2 diabetes, and underscores the need for scientific
investigation aimed at determining the molecular mechanisms by which maternal exercise improves metabolic
health of offspring. For this purpose, and based on our extensive published and preliminary data, we have
defined four Specific Aims. Specific Aim 1 will investigate the vitamin D receptor (VDR) and TGF2 as central
mediators of maternal exercise effects on offspring metabolic health in liver, skeletal muscle, and other
offspring tissues. This includes experiments that will: a) determine the function of VDR in maternal exercise-
induced hepatic, skeletal muscle, and adipose tissue AMPK/TET signaling, epigenetic changes, and in vivo
glucose homeostasis; b) investigate TGF2 as a maternally derived exercise signal that activates epigenetic
changes and improves offspring phenotype; and c) determine if maternal exercise has wide ranging effects to
improve the function of skeletal muscle and adipose tissues. Specific Aim 2 will determine optimal exercise and
pharmacologic treatments for the improvement of offspring metabolic health. This includes experiments to
define: a) optimal maternal exercise protocols to improve metabolic health; and b) pharmacologic activators
that mimic the beneficial effects of maternal exercise on offspring health. Specific Aim 3 is to identify and
determine the function of novel exercise regulated placental proteins that improve the metabolic health of
offspring, as our initial findings established that placenta is central to transmitting the effects of maternal
exercise to offspring. Aim 3 experiments include: a) investigation of novel placental secretory proteins
increased by maternal exercise; b) fetal tissue destination of these proteins; and c) investigating maternal
exercise effects on placenta spatial and single cell transcriptomics. We have recently made the exciting
discovery that grandmaternal exercise improves the metabolic health of second generation (F2) offspring in
adulthood. Specific Aim 4 will determine the mechanisms by which grandmaternal exercise training enhances
F2 offspring health. This will include investigating: a) maternal exercise effects on F1 sperm and oocytes; b)
mechanisms for improved glucose tolerance in F2 offspring, including studies of skeletal muscle glucose
uptake; and c) effects of grandmaternal exercise on epigenetic regulation of skeletal muscle, liver, and adipose
tissue in F2. This emerging area of exercise physiology research has great potential to advance world health
by understanding mechanisms by which exercise during female reproductive years may limit the vicious cycles
of increased metabolic risk across multiple generations.

 This is a renewal of NIH grant DK031036, the original grant to the Kahn lab, which is now in its 38th year
and was granted MERIT status at the last renewal. Since inception, this grant has focused on the insulin and
IGF-1 receptors, their signaling pathways and their alterations in physiologic and pathologic states. Over the
past decade, we have made tremendous progress in understanding the signaling and biological roles of these
receptors through both in vitro and in vivo studies. These include extensive studies using gene targeting to
create single and combinatorial knockouts of insulin and IGF-1 receptors (IR and IGF1R); combinatorial
knockouts IR with post-receptors effectors of insulin action (IRS and FoxO proteins); and tissue-specific and
inducible knockouts to determine the role of IR and IGF1R in individual tissues in normal physiology and the
pathophysiology of diabetes. In addition, in vitro we have defined differential signaling by insulin and IGF-1
receptors, and unique actions of insulin and IGF-1 in different cell types. As a result, since the last competitive
renewal, this grant has provided support for 88 published papers which have led to new insights into the
complex nature of the insulin/IGF-1 signaling network, the contribution of insulin resistance in different organs
to diabetes and metabolic syndrome, as well as evidence on how tissues communicate with one another in
insulin resistant states. In addition, we have made novel observations regarding the role of insulin action in
non-classical target tissues, like the brain, intestine, endothelial and iPS cells; the presence of novel insulin-like
peptides in viruses, and potential for signaling by unoccupied IR and IGF1R. During the coming grant period,
our aims are to continue to expand our understanding of insulin/IGF1 action by 1) defining the differential roles
of the extra- and intra-cellular domains of IR and IGF1R in signaling in vitro and in vivo using three
complementary strategies [mass spectroscopy based phosphoproteomic analysis of insulin/IGF-1 receptor
mutants and chimeric receptors in vitro; creation of a new generation of knock-in mouse models in which IR is
replaced by IGF1R, by chimeric insulin/IGF-1 receptors or by substitutions in the juxtamembrane domain of the
receptor important in differences in IR vs IGF1R signaling, and use of newly discovered viral insulin-like
peptides (VILPs) to explore differences in IR/IGF1R signaling]; 2) determine the nature of signaling by the
unoccupied insulin and IGF-1 receptors involved in control of gene expression, autophagy and apoptosis and
identify the domains of the receptors mediating these effects and the signaling proteins that interact with them
and 3) continuing to define the role of insulin signaling in brain on astrocytes vs neurons using global and
region-specific IR knockouts; insulin regulation of gene expression and metabolite levels in brain; and the
interaction of insulin resistance in brain with genetic risks in pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s Disease. Together
these studies will continue to help unravel new aspects in the mechanisms of insulin/IGF-1 receptor signaling
and their alterations in diabetes, metabolic and neurodegenerative disease.

 This is a proposal for a diversity supplement to the MIRA award R35GM122610 to support Ms. Reem
Hussein-Fricke, MSc, to work as a research trainee for two years in the Blackwell lab. Ms. Hussein-Fricke is a
Black woman of Sudanese origin who was previously enrolled in a PhD program at Rutgers University, but
eventually withdrew from graduate school after experiencing a series of challenging personal circumstances.
With time Ms. Hussein-Fricke has decided to follow her passion for research and re-enter PhD training in order
to pursue a career as a research scientist. This award will allow her to train and develop further as a scientist
in critical ways, and to establish herself as a competitive candidate for top graduate programs.
 The Blackwell lab studies mechanisms that maintain metabolic, protein, and lipid homeostasis, primarily
in the powerful model organism C. elegans. The parent MIRA research addresses specific functions of the
SKN-1 transcription factors, which respond to oxidative, xenobiotic, proteasomal, and metabolic stresses, and
investigates how these and other protective mechanisms influence cellular redox regulation and its effects on
the organism. Ms. Hussein-Fricke will investigate an aspect of metabolic regulation that is an exciting new
direction, how specific metabolic cues control feeding behavior and food intake. Our work in this area so far
has shown that specific nutrients and metabolites profoundly influence feeding behavior and food consumption,
and has suggested models for how this occurs. Ms. Hussein-Fricke will work with a postdoctoral fellow in the
lab who pioneered this area. They will investigate neuronal interactions through which signals we have
identified operate to control feeding, and use genetic screening approaches to identify additional metabolic
cues that influence these behaviors. This research has already begun to profoundly alter our understanding of
relationships between diet, hunger, and satiety.
 During the two-year training period Ms. Hussein-Fricke will benefit from research training, mentoring,
and educational opportunities. In the laboratory she will expand her range of research skills, including gaining
experience in neuronal functional analysis, a specific interest of hers. Most importantly, the time spent in the
lab will provide a research opportunity of sufficient depth to allow her to generate publishable work. Ms.
Hussein-Fricke will benefit from mentoring from Dr. Blackwell, lab members, and a mentoring committee, and
will be deeply steeped in a rich and exciting scientific environment. Through this environment and attendance
at scientific meetings, she will learn scientific presentation skills. During this time she will also avail herself of
courses and workshops in the greater Harvard community in order to develop her knowledge and skills in
bioinformatic and data analysis, another key interest of hers. Together, this experience will allow Ms. Hussein-
Fricke to develop rapidly as a scientist, and build a record of current research accomplishments that will put
her in a very strong position for reentry into a graduate program and completion of a PhD.

While it has long been established that exercise training can have profound effects on systemic glucose
homeostasis and skeletal muscle metabolism, more recent research has demonstrated that adipose tissues
also play an important role in mediating the benefits of exercise on metabolic health. Studies supported by this
award have shown that subcutaneous white adipose tissue (scWAT), the adipose tissue located beneath the
skin, undergoes profound changes in gene and protein expression, structural architecture, and adipokine
profile in response to exercise training, adaptations that play a strategic role in regulating systemic exercise-
facilitated metabolic benefits. The signaling and intracellular mechanisms that control these important changes
in scWAT phenotype and function are not known, but our preliminary data demonstrate that lactate and
glycogen, two factors typically associated with skeletal muscle metabolism in response to exercise, also play
fundamental roles in regulating exercise training effects on scWAT. In Specific Aim 1 lactate signaling through
the G-protein receptor 81 (GPR81) and glycogen metabolism will be investigated as essential mediators of
exercise training-induced adaptations to scWAT phenotype, and in turn, whole body systemic metabolism.
Numerous approaches including genetically modified mouse models, physiological assessments, proteomics,
RNAseq, and lipidomics will be used for this Aim. Specific Aims 2 and 3 will focus on visceral white adipose
tissue (vWAT), the adipose depot that surrounds the internal organs under conditions of fuel over-abundance.
While vWAT has been less studied in the context of molecular adaptations to training, our recently published
multi-omics project investigating key metabolic tissues led to the discovery that under obese conditions,
exercise training induces more profound cellular composition and transcriptomic changes in vWAT compared
to scWAT. We also found that obesity and training significantly impact crosstalk between immune cells and
adipose stem cells (ASCs) in vWAT. Given that exercise is a potent epigenetic modulator, we hypothesize
that exercise training reverses the unfavorable responses to obesity by rewiring of the underlying epigenome
of vWAT. In Specific Aim 2, single cell level open chromatin accessibility and lncRNA expression profiling in vWAT
will be done to determine the epigenetic mechanisms mediating the effects of exercise training and obesity. In Aim
3, exercise training- and obesity-induced immune cell-ASC crosstalk using in vitro and in vivo models will be studied.
This will include a focus on the putative interaction between amphiregulin, produced by type 2 innate lymphoid
cells (ILC2s) with epidermal growth factor receptor of the ASCs, as this was the most striking interaction
predicted by our in-silico single cell analysis. To complement our expertise in exercise science, adipose tissue
biology, cell signaling, metabolism, and in vivo models, studies will be performed in collaboration with world
renown experts in computational biology and immunology. Thus, these studies will generate high quality
scientific discoveries with high potential for clinical impact for the treatment of obesity and type 2 diabetes.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Kenya has a high incidence of breast and cervical cancers, and most women are diagnosed with late-
stage disease. Implementing effective programs to screen and detect these cancers at an early stage could
substantially decrease the high mortality. Kenya has been increasing access to cancer screening, but less
than one-sixth of eligible women have ever received breast and cervical cancer screening.
 The goal of the study is to assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of multicomponent strategies
to increase the uptake of breast and cervical cancer screeening. A key gap that perpetuates the low
screening rates in Kenya is the lack of community–clinic linkages. There is evidence that women are often
unaware of the screening services offered in facilities, and, even among those who are aware, there is lack
of motivation, anticipated or perceived stigma, and reduced self-efficacy to undergo screening. We will
conduct a pragmatic cluster randomized trial to evaluate the screening outcomes, including screening
uptake, diagnostic test completion, and treatment initiation and implementation outcomes to support scale-
up. We will test two multicomponent packages of strategies: (1) Cancer Community–Clinic Linkage (C3Link)
Core: Community health volunteer (CHV)-delivered group education for women and family members to
increase screening uptake in the community setting and practice facilitation to improve the screening
process and develop team-based care with CHV participation in the clinic setting; (2) C3Link Plus: C3Link
Core strategies along with a sequential series of individual strategies that increase in intensity at 3-month
intervals; women who remain unscreened will first receive one-on-one education; second, motivational
interviewing; and, finally, navigation to address specific barriers.
 We will implement the study across 27 communities in Kenya to address the following three specific
aims: Aim 1: Conduct a cluster randomized trial to assess short-term (intervention implementation phase)
and longer-term impacts (maintenance phase) of the two packages of multicomponent strategies on breast
and cervical cancer screening outcomes along the continuum of care compared to enhanced standard of
care (communities receiving a messaging campaign only); Aim 2: Use a mixed-methods approach to assess
and compare multilevel implementation outcomes of the package of strategies focusing on acceptability,
feasibility, appropriateness, fidelity, and sustainability; Aim 3: Perform cost-effectiveness and return-on-
investment analysis to support scale-up of an effective package of implementation strategies across Kenya
and other sub-Saharan African countries. The Kenyan Ministry of Health can use the findings from this study
to design optimal approaches and plan investments in screening infrastructure to scale up implementation of
guideline recommendations. The lessons learned can be applied to other sub-Saharan African settings.

Alzheimer’s disease and epilepsy are common age-related CNS disorders. Both Alzheimer’s disease and
epilepsy are more frequent in the elderly compared to any other age groups, and a history of epilepsy is a risk
factor for development of Alzheimer’s and related dementias. Further, patients with Alzheimer’s disease have
unprovoked seizures and epilepsy at a significantly higher rate than non-demented elderly. These public health
correlations are seen at the level of pathophysiology and manifested symptoms. For example, cognitive
impairment is a definitive aspect of Alzheimer’s disease, and recurrent epileptic seizures are associated with
cognitive impairment. Clearly, the increase in aging of the world’s population makes this comorbidity a major
concern. This proposal is focused on addressing a common pathophysiological mechanism in Alzheimer’s and
epilepsy – dysregulated proinflammatory cytokine production. Proinflammatory cytokine overproduction from
abnormally activated glia is a contributor to subsequent neurological damage and cognitive deficits in both
epilepsy/seizure disorders and in Alzheimer’s and related dementias. Despite advances in our understanding
of these molecular neuroinflammatory mechanisms underlying adverse neuronal sequelae in CNS disorders,
approved therapeutics that target this pathological process are lacking. ImmunoChem Therapeutics (ICT)
proposes to advance MW189, a novel small molecule candidate already in early phase clinical development,
having successfully completed phase 1a and phase 1b clinical trials. MW189 is a selective suppressor of
injury- and disease-induced proinflammatory cytokine overproduction associated with destructive glia
inflammation/synaptic dysfunction cycles and their long-term neurotoxic effects. This proposed Fast-Track
SBIR will deliver a phase 2a trial-ready portfolio for future first-in-patient (FIP) epilepsy treatment trials.
Specifically, we will: 1. Develop a commercial-scale version of a validated GMP clinical grade drug production
approach, produce a multi-Kg drug substance lot, and obtain its release for future patient clinical trials,
2. Obtain preclinical efficacy data for dosing information and the biological rationale required to support future
phase 2a proof-of-concept studies in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy, 3. Prepare required documents and
submit a phase 2 IND for a future clinical trial in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy.
Our milestones and their associated key tasks are organized as SBIR Phase I activities (year 01) and SBIR
Phase II activities (years 02-03). The Fast-Track structure will allow us to immediately move to SBIR Phase II
activities that flow seamlessly from preparation and technology transfer to essential milestones for a future FIP
safety trial including pharmacokinetics and a pharmacodynamic arm. Success will also further de-risk MW189
for future phase 2 trials in Alzheimer’s disease or other age-related disorders that involve dysregulated
neuroinflammation as a driver of disease progression.

Suicide results in 130 preventable American deaths every day, and >700,000 deaths worldwide each year. Non-
fatal suicide attempt (SA) affects an even larger proportion of the population with estimates 10-25 times the
number of individuals who die by suicide (1.4 million in the US, >20 million worldwide). Suicidal ideation (SI), the
contemplation of taking one’s own life, is even more common, with a cross-national lifetime prevalence of 9.2%.
While these suicide outcomes are all significantly heritable, only recently have samples reached sufficient size
to conduct well-powered genetic studies, and thus far, these have largely been limited to SA. Large-scale genetic
studies of the full spectrum of suicide outcomes are necessary to elucidate their genetic and biological etiologies,
potential drug targets, and the similarities and differences between them. Here, we establish the Suicide Working
Group of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, to interrogate the biological basis of the full spectrum of suicide
outcomes in individuals of diverse ancestries, leveraging clinical, population, and medical examiner resources
worldwide. This project will characterize the genetic etiology of suicide outcomes through genome-wide
association studies of at least 69,800 SA cases, 19,500 suicide death (SD) cases, and 206,900 SI cases. We
will elucidate the shared and distinct genetic etiology between suicide outcomes and psychiatric disorders, and
between SA, SD and SI, illuminating the similarities and differences between them. These results will be used
to identify biologically relevant tissues, cell-types, pathways, and drug targets, and to prioritize causal genes and
SNPs underlying genome-wide significant loci. Overall, this proposal dramatically expands and diversifies efforts
to understand the etiology of suicide outcomes, combining prior efforts and expertise from the PI and Co-Is in
genomic studies of SA, SD and SI. The study will provide novel biological insights into genetic risk of suicide
outcomes that will enable potential avenues of therapeutic understanding and risk stratification. Finally, it will
facilitate the worldwide collaborative growth of a highly-powered cohort of diverse ancestries, environmental
exposures, and phenotypes, in which to address many future questions related to suicide outcomes.

There are a myriad of new HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) drug formulations and delivery modalities
under clinical development, and it is expected that a range of biomedical HIV prevention options will soon be
available. To enable these options to have maximum public health impact there is an urgent need to create
biobehavioral infrastructure (i.e., empirically validated knowledge, guidelines, and tools) that will: a) allow the
integration of these new options into existing PrEP delivery systems; b) support adherence and retention in an
emerging HIV prevention service system; and c) promote health equity by ensuring that new prevention
options expand HIV prevention coverage to highest priority populations. However, limited research exists that
integrates lessons from existing implementation efforts for oral PrEP and develops data-driven tools that can
be used by research and clinical practice to accelerate diffusion of proven prevention strategies. In response to
that need, the specific aims of this project are to: (1) Synthesize intervention components of PrEP service
delivery models in seven federally designated Ending the HIV Epidemic (EtHE) hotspot counties across the
US, representing diverse geographical contexts, patient populations, and delivery settings; (2) Operationalize
a set of PrEP service delivery process and outcome metrics than can be used to assess fidelity to service
delivery models for daily oral PrEP and emerging modalities and measure progress toward enhancing
biomedical prevention uptake, persistence, and equitable coverage; and (3) Define universal and modality-
specific pre-implementation and implementation activities necessary for settings to integrate emerging
prevention options into clinical practice. This project builds on the past work of the investigative team in oral
PrEP demonstration and implementation projects, development/testing of novel prevention modalities, and
dissemination of evidence-based implementation tools for clinical practice. To accomplish our aims, we will
apply two seminal theoretical models from the implementation science literature, and collaborate with seven
clinical partners in seven EtHE hotspots across the US, as well as a CDC-funded Capacity Building Assistance
(CBA) provider who delivers PrEP training and technical assistance to sites across the country. The knowledge
generated by this project will not only advance the field of implementation science, but also create tangible
tools that can help clinics, heath systems, and policy decision makers improve PrEP implementation outcomes
at a population level. This project has the potential to make a significant and sustained impact on the quality of
future implementation efforts, and the speed with which new modalities are effectively disseminated to highest
priority populations.

 Monoallelic expression is an unusual form of gene regulation that is often associated with
genes that determine cell-type identity. The olfactory system exhibits an intriguing form of
random monoallelic expression. Each sensory neuron in the mouse nose expresses only one
out of over 2000 odorant receptor (OR) alleles. The current model for OR gene selection
involves the interchromosomal aggregation of distributed enhancers into a single active super-
enhancer, driven by the co-binding of transcription factors Lhx2 and Ebf. This super-enhancer
complex attracts all OR promoters. How this assembly selects a single OR gene promoter for
transcription is unknown. Understanding this process requires a better understanding of how
OR gene promoters function in the context of this super-enhancer complex.
 Like OR enhancers, the promoters contain homeodomain (HD) binding sites for Lhx2 and
Olf1/Ebf (O/E) binding sites for Ebf transcription factors. How these sites act in OR promoters
to engage the choice mechanism is not clear. We propose a set of genetic experiments to
define the role of HD and O/E sites in OR promoter function. To do this we will study targeted
OR transgenes that lie outside of OR clusters, providing a unique tool to study what genetic and
epigenetic features are required for OR expression. Moreover, we propose a combined genetic
and biochemical approach to identify the molecular components of the OR choice mechanism in
the nucleus. Taken together, these approaches seek to elucidate for the first time the molecular
basis for OR monoallelic expression. Our findings will shed light on fundamental mechanisms
that govern gene expression in mammals.

The Role of the Mutant p53-PARP-MCM Pathway in Triple Negative Breast Cancer
Mutant p53 (mtp53) is found in 80% of triple negative breast cancers (TNBCs). There is a need
to increase understanding of mtp53 signaling in TNBC in order to determine strategies to detect
and treat the disease. TNBCs are more common in African American women than in white
women and therefore the proposed work will benefit all women with TNBC including the AA
over-represented population. This application proposes to determine the biological role of
TNBC-associated gain-of-function oncogenic mtp53 R273H that is associated with PARP1
(herein referred to as PARP) protein, MCM2-7 helicases and replicating DNA. The p53 Arg 273
substituted with His, and other hotspot p53 missense mutant proteins, are well known to
function as oncogenic proteins in TNBCs, but their functions outside of acting as aberrant
transcription co-factors are not clearly understood. The R273H mtp53 is present in high levels
on chromatin in many TNBCs and works as a co-factor to activate the transcription of sterol
biosynthesis genes and chromatin remodeling factors, but incredibly R273H also co-associates
with PARP and MCMs on replicating DNA. Our studies have uncovered this novel replication-
associated pathway and we call it the mtp53-PARP-MCM chromatin axis. Our preliminary and
published data reports that knockdown of mtp53 R273H reduces chromatin associated MCM2-7
and PARP. Knockdown of mtp53 in this setting decreases combined PARP inhibitor (PARPi)
talazoparib plus DNA damaging agent temozolomide-mediated cell death, demonstrating that
mtp53 expression influences the sensitivity of cancer cells to synergistic PARPi plus DNA
damage mediated cell killing. Our preliminary and published data showed nuclear mtp53
R273H co-associates with PARP and MCMs and mtp53 R273H directly associates with EdU at
nascent replication forks. Furthermore, we detected high mtp53 R273H, high PARP protein, and
high PARP enzymatic activity in patient derived xenograft tissue expressing R273H mtp53. We
also detected high co-association of mtp53 and PARP in TNBC in a preliminary tumor
microarray screen as well as through analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas reverse phase
protein data sets. As a result, we consider understanding the biology of chromatin-associated
mtp53-PARP-MCM complexes on replicating DNA to be an area of inquiry that will have a
sustained long-term influence on our understanding, detection, and treatment choices for TNBC
in diverse populations of women. The mtp53-PARP-MCM axis in TNBC is an innovative
pathway and elucidating the mechanistic relationship of the proteins working together in
replication-associated activities will help us to better understand the disease. Our hypothesis
is that stable mtp53 interacts with replicating DNA during replication stress using amino
acids from its carboxy-terminal regions. As a consequence, the mtp53-PARP-MCM axis is
engaged allowing increased recruitment of protein complexes and sensitivity to PARP
inhibitors combined with DNA damaging agents. We will test this hypothesis by the following
three aims.
Aim 1: Elucidate the role and mechanism of the TNBC-associated oncogenic mtp53-
PARP-MCM axis.
Aim 2: Increase our understanding of co-expression of mtp53 and PARP using novel
imaging platforms in xenograft mouse models and screening of multiethnic human
breast tissue microarrays to benefit all women with TNBC.
Aim 3: Validate the driver role of the mtp53-PARP-MCM axis influencing PARPi outcomes
in orthotopic mouse models.
Completing this work will provide mechanistic insights on how mtp53 cross-talks with PARP and
MCM proteins on chromatin in cell culture and xenograft models, and will inform the potential of
using novel imaging agents to detect nuclear co-expression of mtp53 and PARP as informative
biomarkers for TNBC.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) poses a triple threat to public health, as its prevalence is on the rise, its costs are
immense, and there is no effective therapy. However, drug development attempts for the treatment of AD have
met with minimal success. The failure is largely attributable to a reductionist concept of "one drug, one gene,
one disease." As AD is a multigenic heterogeneous illness, a new therapeutic strategy is urgently required to
concurrently target the numerous pathogenic processes involved for the genesis and progression of AD in
each individual patient. Many translational bioinformatics strategies for AD drug repurposing have been
developed in recent years. Existing target-based, phenotype-based, network-based, and patient-based drug
repurposing strategies are unable to fully address the challenges of AD drug repurposing due to the lack of
thoroughly validated drug targets, potent lead compounds, and high-throughput phenotype readouts that can
characterize the molecular complexity of AD. Over the past decade, we have built an artificial intelligence-
based quantitative systems pharmacology (AI-QSP) platform that attempts to predict and characterize
genome-wide chemical-protein interactions and functional activities, as well as correlate molecular interactions
with phenotypic responses. Our AI-QSP platform integrates diverse omics data synergistically and incorporates
machine learning, biophysics, and systems biology methodologies. The AI-QSP platform has been effectively
applied to drug repurposing including AD, polypharmacology, side effect prediction, and precision medicine.
Established our proof-of-concept studies, we propose to develop and thoroughly evaluate a unique
computational methodology that combines target-based and mechanism-driven phenotypic chemical screening
for AD individualized drug repurposing. Using a novel domain adaptation strategy, we will expand our context-
independent phenotypic compound screening methodologies to AD patient-specific, cell type-specific,
transcriptome-based drug repurposing. In addition, we will analyze the ADME features of repurposed
pharmaceuticals in the human brain utilizing cutting-edge physiologically based pharmacokinetics (PBPK)
techniques. We will improve state-of-the-art drug-gene-disease network models for Alzheimer's disease drug
repurposing by incorporating understudied dark proteins that are abundant in the target list suggested by AD
omics studies and their inhibitory or activatory effects, and by applying graph mining techniques for drug-gene-
disease link predictions. Using cell-based disease models and RNA-seq studies, we will combine
complementary phenotype-based and target-based techniques to rank drug candidates and confirm their
efficacy and toxicity on AD treatment. In conclusion, the successful completion of this project could provide the
scientific community with a novel translational bioinformatics resource for identifying potential therapeutics for
effective personalized AD treatments and advancing drug repurposing to a new phase of lead optimizations
and clinical trials.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Project Summary
Anxiety- and stress-induced psychiatric disorders affect millions of Americans and often involve social
avoidance as a coping strategy for reducing the risk of confronting a stressor. Chronic social defeat stress
(CSDS), a widely used rodent model of stress, reliably leads to decreased social interaction in stress
susceptible animals, which may reflect clinically relevant fear-based behavior. Accordingly, our work in
129Sv/Ev mice indicates a role for fear learning in CSDS-induced social avoidance, implicating the
involvement of the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala (BLA). However, surprisingly little is known about the
contribution of the BLA to circuits underlying CSDS-induced social avoidance, where the primary focus has
been on reward circuitry. We propose to address this gap in the literature in three specific aims, using a
combination of behavior, functional circuit mapping, circuit manipulations, and in-vivo physiology. First, in Aim
1, we will investigate whether BLA inputs to the nucleus accumbens (NAc), a key region for mediating social
interactions, contribute to CSDS-induced social avoidance. To this end, we will use functional circuit mapping
to identify whether CSDS upregulates activity in BLA projections to the NAc during social avoidance of a CD-1
relative to a non-avoided conspecific. Further, using chemogenetics, we will test whether BLA-NAc projections
are necessary for CSDS-mediated social avoidance of the CD-1. Then, in Aim 2, we will use the same
methods to focus on how input from the prelimbic region (PL) of the medial prefrontal cortex to the BLA affects
social interaction in defeated and non-defeated mice. Given the importance of the PL-BLA circuit in fear
expression and avoidance learning, we expect that PL inputs to the BLA will be active during social avoidance
and necessary for expression of this learned response. Finally, in Aim 3, we will use multisite in-vivo
physiology to investigate the dynamics of PL-BLA-NAc communication during social interaction before and
after CSDS in both sexes. These findings will fill an important gap in our understanding of how fear learning
circuitry contributes to the well-studied reward circuitry that mediates non-selective social avoidance. Given the
high co-morbidity of anxiety- and mood- disorders, this project will provide critical new information to help
integrate our understanding of the fear and reward systems in mediating social avoidance, providing a more
holistic understanding of this behavioral response to stress.

As clinical trials have high failure rates, in part due to reliance on animal testing that can produce inaccurate
results, accurate in vitro models of human physiology and disease are needed to bridge this gap. Recent
progress in organoid and organ-on-chip systems demonstrates promising potential to do this; however, in vitro
models have their own limitations. Stem cell derived models tend to have immature phenotypes, primary cell
derived models may be difficult to keep functioning for long periods of time, and in vitro models in general do
not recapitulate the full functionality of human organs. In an effort to increase the physiological relevance of
these systems, we have developed a cardiovascular microfluidic organoid chip, the µCV chip, which develops
according to biomimetic morphogen gradients, and can self-assemble into elongated tube-like structures when
the cells are seeded in specific starting geometries with a robotic seeding machine. These pumping tube-like
structures can generate flow autonomously in our microfluidic chips. Although this preliminary data is
compelling, it remains to be tested whether these tube-like structures have cellular spatial organization or
heart-like functionality that is more physiologically accurate than simpler cardiac spheroids. In this proposal, we
aim to systematically compare cardiovascular spheroids and cardiovascular tube-shaped microfluidic
organoids in depth, in order to further understand how the organization and functionality of organoids change
when seeded with different starting geometries and exposed to different flow conditions, and test the
hypothesis that tube-shaped flow-generating cardiovascular organoids have microphysiology more similar to a
simplified human heart. We will further expand the repertoire of our microfluidic organoid chip by teaming up
with colleagues in the Division of Liver Diseases to create hepatic organoids, both iPSC derived and primary
cell derived, in order to similarly evaluate differences in hepatic function when the organoids are created with
spheroid versus tubular geometries and exposed to different flow conditions. Finally, we will combine these two
microfluidic organoid systems into a single microfluidic heart-liver microphysiologic system, the µCV-MPS, and
characterize the two organoids as they co-develop and function within a single circulatory system. As the liver
is responds to flow and beat rate, and the heart responds to factors secreted by the liver, we hypothesize that
we will observe improvements in functionality, viability, and microphysiology by studying heart and liver
organoids while they are connected via paracrine signaling and homeostatic regulatory mechanisms. We will
additionally use the µCV-MPS as a model of Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease, which is known to lead to
cardiovascular disease including left ventricular hypertrophy and diastolic disfunction, pathologies which we
hypothesize to be observable inthe µCV-MPS. Validation of this model system would represent a significant
step forward in the sophistication and capabilities of human MPS models, helping to provide more predictive
alternatives to animal models for next-generation therapeutic development and regulatory approval.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH is a rare, progressive, incurable, and fatal cardiopulmonary vascular
disease leading to right ventricle failure and ultimately to death. Despite the available treatments and ongoing
research efforts, there is currently no curative treatment against PAH or pathological vascular remodeling.
Changes in chromatin that can influence the epigenetic regulation of many genes and their functional
consequences on vascular remodeling in PAH are poorly understood. The SWItch/Sucrose Non-Fermentable
(SWI/SNF) chromatin remodeling complexes control the accessibility of chromatin to transcriptional and
coregulatory machinery. The AT-rich interactive domain-containing protein 1a (ARID1a), a subunit of the
SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex, plays key roles in normal physiology and diseases. The functional
implications of ARID1a deficiency are dependent on its downstream transcriptional consequences, which can
be altered by other epigenetic transcriptional regulators in the specific cellular context. Homeostasis requires
balanced action of ARID1a and the Enhancer of Zeste Homolog2 (EZH2), a histone methyltransferase, through
chromatin-mediated gene expression. Yet, the role of ARID1a in PAH remains understudied. Given the various
studies implicating ARID1a as a critical tumor suppressor, the objective of this proposal is to investigate the
expression level of ARID1a and the link between ARID1A and EZH2 in pulmonary vascular smooth muscle cells
(PASMCs) growth and dysfunction. The central hypothesis is that ARID1a loss impairs enhancer-mediated
gene regulation and drives aberrant growth of PASMCs in PAH through altered chromatin accessibility and/or
DNA methylation via EZH2. The hypothesis is supported by preliminary data of a significant reduction of ARID1a
expression level in PAH human and animal models of PAH. Importantly, ARID1a depletion increases PASMC
proliferation and increases EZH2 expression. Hence, the hypothesis will be tested by pursuing the following
three specific aims: 1) Investigate the function of ARID1A in PASMC phenotype, and the central role of ARID1a
in the chromatin dynamics and the regulation of gene expression in PASMCs; 2) Evaluate the impact of SMC
conditional ARID1a ablation in the pathogenesis of PAH; and 3) Assess the effectiveness of the combination
therapy of AAV2.5/ARID1a with EZH2 inhibitors in the context of severe rat models of PAH. The data generated
from this proposal will advance our knowledge about the role of ARID1a in the phenotype of PASMC-driven
pulmonary vascular disease with implications for potential therapeutic interventions in PAH.

Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) is a common chronic condition that affects more than 1 billion people worldwide.
Currently, presence of OSA and its severity is assessed using the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) that measures
the frequency/rate of respiratory events. AHI has demonstrable limitations including lack predictive accuracy and
poor relationship to outcomes. Task forces across the American Academy of Sleep Medicine, Sleep Research
Society and others internationally have made an urgent plea to move the diagnosis and management of sleep
apnea beyond the AHI. In response to this, our group has recently developed a physiology guided AI/ML
approach that utilizes the known OSA pathophysiology across ventilatory, hypoxic, and arousal burdens and
combines them into probability scores that provide risk of short- and long-term adverse outcomes of OSA. We
use fully automate, reliable, and interpretable measures for ventilatory, hypoxic, and arousal burden towards our
pursuit of explainable AI. Our preliminary data from 10,952 subjects across three epidemiological cohorts
suggests that the machine-learned sleep apnea probability of sleepiness (SAPs), which combines
ventilatory/hypoxic/arousal burdens, classifies sleepiness with accuracy of 87%. Further, using the same
approach but with different set of weights that were trained to predict cardiovascular (CVD) and all-cause
mortality, the sleep apnea probability of CVD (SAPcv) predicted CVD and all-cause mortality across 4,784
subjects with an accuracy of 81% and 88% respectively. To be translatable into clinical practice, validation of
AI/ML approaches in a sleep clinic population is needed and is the core objective of our proposal. In Aim 1 we
will validate SAPs and SAPcv as probability scores for risk of short- and long-term outcomes across a sleep
clinical population comprising data from a diverse set of subjects (N=6,393) seen at the Mount Sinai Health
System from the Greater New York Area. In Aim 2, we will assess real-world performance of SAPs across
subjects (N=700) see at Mount Sinai, as a tool in the decision-making pipeline to predict improvements in
sleepiness with 3 months of treatment using any modality (e.g., CPAP, oral, positional etc.). Finally, in Aim 3, we
will use causal random forests to assess conditional average treatment effects, thereby identifying subgroup of
subjects who are likely to benefit from treatment with respect to CVD outcomes. Our proposal will offer crucial
evidence needed to translate metrics that go beyond AHI in assessing severity of OSA into clinical practice and
are thus poised to shift the paradigm in clinical management of OSA.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) affects 10-15% of U.S. adults, costs over $37 billion annually,
and causes serious symptoms, physical impairment and high hospital admission and mortality rates. Much of its
burden can be reduced by following guideline recommended self-care activities, like daily use of disease
controlling medications and pulmonary rehabilitation. Yet patients often struggle with the self-care needed to
maintain or improve their health. The potential barriers to successful self-care are numerous, encompassing
socioeconomic, psychosocial, physical, cognitive and other domains. Moreover, many of the barriers are major
contributors to health inequities, as reflected in poorer access to COPD treatments and poorer outcomes among
racial and ethnic minority patients. Most COPD self-management support interventions have largely followed
one-size-fits-all strategies of education and training. We created the Supporting self-Management Behaviors for
aging Adults (SaMBA)-COPD intervention based on the successful SaMBA program for older adults with asthma.
The model is unique among chronic illness self-management programs because it involves comprehensive
screening for barriers to self-management and disease control and couples it with tailored, theory-based, barrier-
specific interventions. The intervention is delivered by community health workers and includes steroid and
antibiotic prescribing for early intervention of COPD exacerbations and home-based pulmonary rehabilitation
(HBPR). Our feasibility trial of SaMBA-COPD, conducted with a predominantly Black and Latinx population, met
most of the benchmarks for success, including complete preparation of all intervention and study related
materials and protocols, intervention fidelity and patient acceptability, and outcomes that suggest the intervention
will improve self-management behaviors and reduce COPD symptoms. We now propose a fully powered
randomized trial among inner-city adults with COPD (n=300). The Specific Aims are to test the impact of SaMBA-
COPD on (1) COPD controller medication adherence and other self-management behaviors at 6 months; (2) on
clinical outcomes (COPD symptoms measured with the COPD Assessment Test and 6-minute walk test
distance) at 6 months, and emergency department visits and hospitalizations at 12 months; and (3) to examine
mechanisms of intervention effect on medication adherence and clinical outcomes, with a focus on the role of
COPD illness and medication beliefs. We will recruit adults ages 40 years and older with advanced COPD in
outpatient practices in New York City. The intervention will be delivered for 6 months. Attention control patients
will receive untailored COPD education. Sustainability of treatment effects will be evaluated at 12 months. The
intervention is significant and innovative for its comprehensive pre-trial preparation, attention to the full range of
contributors to suboptimal self-management and COPD control, the broadening of community health workers'

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Asthma affects 8% of the United States population >60 years and causes considerable harm: older adults are
4 times more likely to die from asthma and have twice the risk of hospitalization. The burden of asthma is
notably greater among minoritized older adults. Research suggests that perception of expiratory airflow
limitation may be a major determinant of asthma outcomes in older adults, and that older adults are
substantially less aware of airway obstruction than younger adults. These observations suggest that perception
of airflow limitation is a potential target for improving outcomes of older patients with asthma; however, there
has been very limited research in this area. We completed a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) of an
intervention that trains older adults with asthma to better perceive expiratory airway obstruction through
feedback via peak expiratory flow (PEF) prediction and couples this feedback with motivational interviewing
(MI) to promote change in asthma self-management behaviors. Compared to an attention control, the
intervention improved PEF, perception of airflow limitation and asthma control. In this project, we propose to
conduct a fully powered RCT to test the intervention’s efficacy in a large cohort of older adults with asthma and
understand the mechanisms underlying improvements in asthma control and objective measures of expiratory
airflow. The Specific Aims are to (1) Test the impact of the intervention on perception of expiratory airflow
limitation in older adults with asthma, (2) Examine the efficacy of the intervention for improvements in lung
function (forced expiratory volume in one second [FEV1] and PEF), self-reported asthma control (Asthma
Control Questionnaire [ACQ] scores), quality of life (Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire [AQLQ] scores), and
emergency department and hospital use, (3) Test the intervention’s impact on mean daily ICS dose used (daily
maintenance and as needed) and illness beliefs. We will conduct a RCT of 300 older (≥60 years) patients with
uncontrolled asthma who are on controller medications (daily maintenance or as needed) recruited from
underserved inner-city practices and randomize them to an intervention consisting of PEF feedback training
and MI (with or without a booster session at 6 months) or a time-matched attention control group. The
intervention will be delivered for 3 sessions over 6 weeks. Control patients will receive supportive counseling
related to their asthma and standardized, untailored asthma education during 3 individual sessions. Data will
be collected at baseline, 1-month, 6-months (primary analyses of effectiveness) and 12-months post-
intervention. In secondary analyses, we will test the sustainability of treatment effects with vs. without the
booster treatment session (active booster vs. attention control booster) delivered immediately after the 6 month
assessment on outcomes at 12-months. The project addresses a significant public health problem in a
vulnerable patient population. The innovative intervention addresses a significant public health problem among
patients who are rarely the focus of interventions to improve asthma outcomes.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) affects over one billion adults and is an independent risk factor for
cardiovascular disease (CVD). Yet, in randomized clinical trials (RCT), treatment of OSA has failed to
demonstrate a beneficial impact of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) on cardiovascular (CVD) event
rates in this population. In this proposal, we hypothesize that the non-significant RCTs are not due to lack of
continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) effectiveness but instead due to suboptimal CPAP adherence,
variability in the clinical presentation of OSA as well as the heterogeneity of treatment effect with CPAP.
Notably, no study has applied machine learning (ML) to multimodal data that extends beyond
polysomnography to identify individuals at enhanced risk for atherosclerosis progression or experiencing CVD
events. The 2021 NIH Sleep Research Plan identified critical and high-priority areas for further research,
including leveraging ML analytic approaches for big data to advance our understanding of sleep disorders and
assist in the personalization of treatment. The overall goal of this proposal is to apply ML to well-characterized
datasets with multimodal data to develop separate prediction tools for predicting incident CVD events (Aim 1),
and heterogeneity of treatment effect with CPAP in OSA patients (Aim 2). We will then validate the models
using real-world electronic health records to ensure their generalizability and clinical relevance (Aim 3). This
groundbreaking proposal aims to revolutionize the management of OSA patients by developing prediction tools
using multimodal data and cutting-edge ML techniques, resulting in a more personalized approach to care that
can improve patient outcomes and reduce the burden of OSA-related CVD events. These decision tools will be
readily integrated into the clinical environment, guiding treatment decisions and assisting sleep physicians in
determining which patients should avoid CPAP use and which OSA patients should be prioritized for CPAP
treatment, optimizing treatment plans and reducing healthcare costs.

Machine learning-based pathogenicity predictors, trained on known disease and non-disease-implicated
variants, predict whether a variant is pathogenic or benign. They have become a key component of genetic
variant discovery and clinical genetic testing. However, their use in individual-level genetic and genomic
disease risk prediction has been limited by their incompatibility with typically reported measures of risk, and
terminology associated with clinical decision-making. Variant pathogenicity predictors generally serve as a key
interpretation tool for rare variants in the absence of large enough cohorts to achieve statistical power. As the
clinical deployment of genetic and genomic risk prediction models becomes more widespread, it is essential
that rare variants be readily incorporated into these models and the risk conferred by such variants be correctly
accounted for. To address these gaps, the proposed study will develop methods for the systematic integration
and calibration of variant pathogenicity predictors into genetic and genomic disease risk prediction and will test
the hypothesis that these methods lead to more accurate and clinically interpretable predictions of disease risk.
This work will be carried out through three specific aims: (1) we will adapt and calibrate existing predictors for
gene-specific prediction of pathogenic variants, (2) we will develop variant pathogenicity predictor-based
exomic disease risk scores, and (3) we will integrate pathogenicity predictors into genome-wide polygenic risk
score (PRS) development. The principal investigator (PI) will bring deep expertise in variant pathogenicity
predictor development and model calibration to this project, and build a team with complementary expertise in
statistical genetics and polygenic risk score development to carry out the work. Additionally, the PI has
formulated a plan for his scientific and professional development, and will assemble an external advisory
committee with further complementarity of expertise (e.g., in population genetics and clinical genetics). This
project will leverage multiple large genome-phenotype data sets that are available publicly (UK Biobank,
dbGaP) and through the world-class infrastructure at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai (BioMe).
This work is expected to have positive impact on multiple fronts. First, there are currently no systematic
integration and calibration frameworks for variant pathogenicity predictors that can be generalized for risk
prediction across different types of variants, genes and/or diseases. Second, open-source software to calibrate
the output of variant pathogenicity predictors in specific contexts (genes, diseases, among others) will be
developed and shared with the broader community. Finally, computationally derived estimates of prevalence of
pathogenic variants and risk models will be made available through Mount Sinai and NIH resources.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
Telomere attrition starts in early life, tracks into adulthood, and is associated with increased risk for aging-related
chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease. Because genetic factors explain only a small proportion of
telomere length variability, it is critical to determine prenatal environmental exposures that affect telomere length
dynamics in early life. Recent evidence shows that prenatal exposures to endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs)
may promote telomere attrition in young children. However, existing data are limited, and the potential interplay
of EDC mixtures with other environmental stressors and the implicated mechanisms remain unknown. For
example, dietary factors and obesity also have been associated with shorter telomere length, potentially by
altering oxidative stress, inflammation, and metabolic pathways that are also disrupted by EDCs. Thus, EDC
exposures may act synergistically with diet and obesity to influence telomere length dynamics in childhood and
beyond. However, no previous study has examined the potential impacts and interactions of prenatal EDC
exposures with other factors on telomere lenght dynamics during the sensitive period of accelerated growth in
the transition from childhood to adolescence. Therefore, we propose the first and largest longitudinal
investigation on the prenatal exposome and telomere attrition, with extended follow-up through
adolescence. We will use an innovative multi-omics analytical framework to advance the knowledge about the
joint impacts of prenatal EDC exposures and their interplay with diet, obesity, and inflammatory and metabolic
pathways on telomere lenght dynamics and adolescent health. Our central hypothesis, supported by strong
preliminary results, is that prenatal exposures to EDC mixtures and their interactions promote telomere attrition
in childhood and through adolescence by dysregulating inflammatory and metabolism-regulating pathways. To
test this hypothesis, we will leverage the unique existing resources of the population-based Human Early Life
Exposome (HELIX) project. HELIX provides an unparalleled early-life exposome characterization (>200
environmental exposures) with completely harmonized biomonitoring data on ~80 known EDCs and repeated
telomere lenght measurements in 700 mothers and their children followed longitudinally from pregnancy to age
~16 years in six European countries. We will measure high-throughput proteomics covering >700 inflammation
and metabolic proteins in archived plasma from children collected at age ~8 years to comprehensively
characterize biological pathways promoting telomere attrition due to early-life EDC exposures, as well as their
interplay with telomere lenght tracking from childhood to adolescence. Findings will advance our understanding
of the impacts of early-life exposures to exogenous chemicals and their interplay with diet, obesity, and
inflammatory and metabolic pathways on telomere attrition during sensitive periods of development. This
knowledge will critically inform environmental public health policies and personalized interventions for early
prevention of cardiovascular disease as well as other highly prevalent aging-related chronic diseases.

Pluripotent stem cells hold great promise for regenerative medicine. Beyond their ability to restore normal
tissues, their potential can be expanded even further through engineering approaches to create new lineages
with therapeutic properties that are not normally made in vivo. In preliminary studies, we have created pluripotent
stem cell lines that 1) have been genomically edited such that they are able to cross human-mouse barriers; 2)
engineered these cells to carry a knockin insertion of a broadly neutralizing HIV antibody at the endogenous loci.
With these cells, we will develop strategies to differentiate human pluripotent stem cells into transplantable
pathogen-specific plasma cells. This process will involve iterative and recursive steps to engineer pluripotent
stem cell differentiation to downstream hematopoietic, B cell, and plasma cell lineages using single cell
transcriptional trajectories as guides. These targeted approaches will be complemented with unbiased genetic
and small molecule screens for new pathways that promote or inhibit specific steps in differentiation, and
additional single cell transcriptomic and epigenetic analyses to provide templates for cellular engineering.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Type 1 diabetes represents a major public health burden. While the availability of improved insulin pumps and continuous glucose monitors has eased some of the daily practical and psychological burden of T1D, technology has not dramatically improved glucose control, with studies conducted by the T1DExchange ~5 years apart showing no improvement in HbA1c over the lifespan. There has also been only limited improvement in the shortened lifespan observed in those with T1D, and the incidence of T1D has increased over the last twenty or more years. Initiated and perpetuated by a complex interplay of genetic risk factors, environmental triggers and dysregulated immune responses, the natural history of T1D unfolds in a series of events that progress at variable rates towards onset of clinical disease. Yet the precise correlates and determinants of T1D pathogenesis remain incompletely defined. The identification and validation of novel biomarkers is critical to promote better stratification of T1D risk and progression, can illuminate pathways of disease pathogenesis and heterogeneity, and likely will inform the development of interventional strategies to delay or prevent disease. 
To precipitate the identification of robust and improved biomarkers, the TrialNet consortium designed the key question 1 (KQ1) PBMC study, a nested case/control study of 178 multiple Aab+ at-risk individuals that over a period of three years either did (“cases”) or did not (“controls”) progress to clinical disease. This earlier study aimed to correlate the evolution of transcriptomic and phenotypic immune cell profiles with incipient T1D onset. KQ1 analyses incorporating detailed clinical metadata are currently ongoing, and we now seek to complement these efforts with a broad interrogation of soluble serum factors from the very same KQ1 donor cohort. Here, the “KQ1 serum study” aims to 1., to identify and validate serum biomarkers for T1D risk, development and/or progression; 2., to establish a comprehensive data resource for reference and orientation, hypothesis generation and improved interventional study design; and 3., to execute broadly integrated data analyses in particular with emerging transcriptional and phenotypic immune cell data from the KQ1 cohort. To this end, we have identified and prioritized suitable targets and analytical approaches, robust technology platforms, and investigator teams with track records to perform high-throughput analyses. Since the scope of our proposal is delimited by the amount of available KQ1 serum samples, we developed a highly collaborative Research Plan that deploys both discovery- and hypothesis-driven investigative strategies. Our proposed interrogations include expansive measurements of serum proteins, antibody responses against commensal bacteria, PBMC responder transcriptomics, and exocrine pancreatic factors. Integrative analytics will be leveraged to define novel serum signatures for T1D risk stratification, improve prediction of disease progression rates, and elucidate aspects of T1D pathogenesis that may accelerate the development of tailored diagnostic, prophylactic and therapeutic modalities. Altogether, the KQ1 serum study has unique potential to build a robust framework for future integration of serum biomarkers in the improved management of T1D.

Americans commonly consume excess amounts of dietary fructose. Added fructose has been shown to have an
adverse impact on metabolic health, including increased insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes (T2D) risk.
However, the mechanisms that link dietary fructose and metabolic health are poorly understood. Malabsorption
or incomplete metabolism of fructose in the small intestine is common in the population. Excess fructose reaches
the colon where it may change the structure and function of the gut microbiome, alter bacterial metabolites and
trigger inflammatory responses impacting T2D risk. To elucidate whether commonly consumed levels of dietary
fructose influence metabolic outcomes through altering the gut microbiome, we will randomize 30 participants to
a controlled cross-over dietary intervention, in which they will consume 12-day isocaloric, added fructose or
glucose diets (25% of total calories) separated by a 10 day controlled diet washout period. We aim to:
1: Determine the relationships between high fructose consumption, the gut microbiome and metabolic
risk.
2: Characterize the causal role(s) that fructose-induced alterations to the gut microbiome have on
metabolic risk using a germ-free mouse model.
We will measure 1) microbiota community structure and function via metagenomic sequencing of stool, 2) fecal
metabolites via targeted and untargeted metabolomics, 3) anthropometrics, 4) insulin resistance, serum markers
of T2D risk and inflammatory cytokines, 5) fecal microbial carbohydrate oxidation capacity and 6) liver fat via
MRI elastography. We will use novel statistical approaches, including Distributed Lag Modeling, to understand
the complex relationships between diet, the microbiome, metabolites and health outcomes.
We will then conduct controlled dietary interventions and fecal microbiome transplantation studies in germ-free
mice. Donor fecal samples from human participants in both the glucose and fructose arms of the clinical
intervention will be transplanted into germ-free and colonized mice to establish a causal relationship between
fructose-induced changes to the gut microbiome, liver fat and metabolic and inflammatory changes known to
increase risk for T2D.
We aim to comprehensively assess the structural and functional changes to the gut microbiome brought about
by a high fructose diet. Determining the impact of excess fructose on the microbiome will help identify novel
means by which fructose contributes to metabolic disease risk. In addition to identifying strategies to improve
metabolic health in adults, data from this proposal could help inform targeted approaches to mitigate future
disease risk in vulnerable populations that consume high levels of fructose, such as children.

Immune cells are an integral part of the white adipose tissue microenvironment and have pronounced effects on
the expansion and activation of thermogenic adipocytes, also known as beige/brite adipocytes. Anti-inflammatory
factors are postulated to be beneficial for insulin resistance and diabetes. We recently reported that ablation of
interleukin-10 (IL10)-associated anti-inflammatory signaling in mice, surprisingly, improved insulin sensitivity and
glucose tolerance, protected against diet-induced obesity, and elicited browning of white adipose tissue. Yet,
several questions remain about the mechanisms that mediate the metabolic actions of IL10: i) how does IL10
block adipose thermogenesis? ii) what are the fates of adipocytes deficient in IL10 signaling? and, iii) since IL10
is produced by multiple immune cell types, which adipose-resident immune cell is responsible for IL10
production? Our proposal builds upon our comprehensive data to address the crosstalk between immune cells
and adipocytes within adipose tissue depots in regulating systemic metabolism and adipose thermogenesis. Our
published and pilot studies show that interfering with IL10 activity in adipocytes is associated with increased
mitochondrial respiration and energy expenditure. Reconstitution of wild-type bone marrow into IL10 knockout
mice reversed the thermogenic phenotype. Ablation of adipose T cells increased adipose thermogenesis,
pointing to a hematopoietic origin of the IL-10 signal regulating adipose tissue function. The IL10 receptor
(IL10Ra) is highly expressed in mature adipocytes, and adipocyte-specific knockdown of IL10Ra decreases fat
mass and increases adipose thermogenesis and energy expenditure. Conversely, IL10 treatment directly
antagonizes the expression of thermogenic genes in a cell-autonomous manner. Furthermore, genome-wide
Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin (ATAC)-seq, ChIP-seq, and RNA-seq demonstrated that IL-10
represses the transcription of thermogenic genes by altering chromatin configuration at key enhancer and
promoter regions through STAT3. Our findings identify the “IL10-IL10Ra-STAT3 axis” as a novel regulator of the
thermogenic transcriptional program in adipose tissue and challenge conventional assumptions regarding links
between immune and inflammatory signaling and adipose tissue function in obesity. To further test the
hypothesis that adipocyte-specific IL10Ra directly “senses” IL10 in the microenvironment to limit adipose
thermogenesis and energy expenditure, I propose three Specific Aims to define: i) mechanisms underlying IL10
inhibition of thermogenic gene transcription and beige adipocyte formation; ii) the fates of adipocytes in the
presence and absence of IL10Ra, and iii) adipose resident immune cells responsible for anti-thermogenic
activities.

Infection of the olfactory epithelium in COVID-19 patients is thought to underlie loss of smell (anosmia), a
pathognomonic symptom that can be long-term in some patients, significantly affecting quality of life. The
olfactory epithelium is also believed to be a major entry point for systemic SARS-CoV-2 infection, which can
result in neurological as well as respiratory symptoms. Wild-type SARS-CoV-2 cannot bind the mouse ACE2
receptor, and existing human ACE2 (hACE2)-expressing mouse models either do not permit conditional
analysis or do not confer severe illness after infection. Due to the lack of genetically manipulable models that
display severe disease, the infected cell types responsible for acute and long-term anosmia, and the route(s)
by which the virus penetrates the brain, have not been definitively identified. To address these gaps in
knowledge and test cell type-specific requirements for COVID-19-related pathologies we generated conditional
hACE2fl knockin mice that express hACE2 in similar cell types to humans. hACE2fl mice nasally inoculated with
a high dose of wild-type SARS-CoV-2 display initial infection of olfactory epithelium and rapidly develop
anosmia. This is followed by infection of neurons in the olfactory bulb and brain, which is associated with
lethality and requires neuronal hACE2 expression. Importantly, specific destruction of olfactory epithelium via
methimazole treatment prevents olfactory bulb and brain infection and lethality, identifying the olfactory
epithelium as an essential gateway to CNS infection. hACE2fl mice inoculated with a low dose of wild-type
SARS-CoV-2 show reversible disease and survive, but a subset displays a long-term decrease in odor
sensitivity (hyposmia) like that observed in humans. We propose to use hACE2fl mice to provide definitive
genetic evidence for cellular mechanisms of short- and long-term loss of smell and identify the pathways for
brain infection during COVID-19. These studies are expected to complement existing descriptive human
studies to identify causal pathogenic mechanisms and preventative and therapeutic targets. Three specific
aims will be pursued: (i) define the cellular requirements for acute loss of smell; (ii) determine the mechanisms
of long-term hyposmia; and (iii) uncover the cellular mechanisms of olfactory bulb and brain infection.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Summary
The RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK (RAS/MAPK) signaling pathway is an established driver of many cancers, commonly
hyperactivated by genetic alterations in RAS or BRAF. RAF and MEK inhibitors (RAFi and MEKi) have been
clinically successful in BRAF-mutant (BRAF-MUT) tumors, but their clinical efficacy in RAS-mutant (RAS-MUT)
tumors has been so far modest, limited by toxicities. Based on the experience with BRAF-MUT tumors, we posit
that clinical efficacy of RAS pathway-targeting inhibitors requires selective MAPK inhibition in RAS-MUT tumors
over RAS-WT normal cells. To achieve such RAS-MUT tumor-selective potency of RAS pathway inhibitors, we
need better understanding of how RAS activation affects target drug binding and MAPK inhibition in cells. The
goal of this proposal is to accomplish a better understanding of how the cellular context affects tumor-selective
therapeutic potency of RAFi and MEKi, with the goal of designing more effective therapeutic strategies for RAS-
MUT cancers. Our preliminary findings suggest that RAS activation differentially affects RAFi binding to RAF
paralogs, as well as their protein stability. We have further evidence that although RAFi suppress MAPK
preferentially in RAS-MUT over RAS-WT normal cells, combinations of RAFi and MEKi result in similar MAPK
inhibition in the two contexts, they are thus predicted to promote dose-limiting toxicities. Our hypothesis is that
RAS activation affects protein expression levels and conformations of RAF paralogs and MEK resulting in
differential binding to RAFi and MEKi, determining tumor-selective MAPK and cell growth inhibition by these
drugs. This hypothesis will be tested in three Aims: Aim 1 will characterize differential RAFi binding to RAF
paralogs in RAS-MUT and normal cells using in-cell binding assays and structural and biophysical approaches.
Aim 2 will define effects of RAS activation on RAF paralog protein stability and expression. Aim 3 will characterize
biochemically, biophysically and in vivo combinations of diverse RAFi and MEKi to determine whether the lack
of tumor-selective suppression of MAPK signaling in RAS-MUT tumor over RAS-WT normal cells increases
toxicity and limits the efficacy of combined RAFi+MEKi.
The proposed research will develop experimental tools and concepts to delineate mechanisms determining
differential potency of RAFi and MEKi in RAS-MUT over normal cellular contexts. Defining such mechanisms
should enable the rational design of more effective RAS pathway-targeting drugs and drug combinations for the
treatment of RAS-MUT cancers.

We previously reported that the viability of some breast cancers depends on histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6). We
also developed a biomarker (HDAC6-score, validated with a NY CLIA certified test) to identify cancers that depend
on HDAC6 function. By analyzing over 3,000 primary breast cancers, we have recently found that ~30% of all
breast cancers can benefit from targeted therapy against HDAC6. Thus, we designed a clinical trial in partnership
with Acetylon/Celgene to investigate the leading HDAC6 inhibitor (HDAC6i, Ricolinostat) plus nab-paclitaxel as
breast cancer therapy (NCT02632071). Notably, we have observed that this regimen is well tolerated, and that
clinical activity is identified in patients with metastatic disease. Molecularly, we have found that HDAC6 de-
acetylates cMyc and that inhibition of HDAC6 promotes hyperacetylation of cMyc and its degradation by the
proteasome. Furthermore, we linked the reduction of Myc expression due to HDAC6 inhibition to the anticancer
activity of HDAC6i (manuscript accepted in Nature Cancer).Objective: In this grant proposal, our ultimate goal is
to understand the molecular mechanism that mediates the anticancer activity of HDAC6i/s and to use this
information to improve HDAC6-based breast cancer regimens. In this grant proposal, we will pursue these
objectives by two independent but complementary aims.
Aim 1. Define the clinical space for HDAC6 inhibitors in breast cancer treatment
we hypothesize that including HDAC6i/s in therapeutic regiments for HR+ and HER2+ patients with high HDAC6
scores will have a superior therapeutic impact.
 - Aim 1a. Evaluate the response of high and low HDAC6-score HR+/HER2- cancer cells to a combination of
 HDAC6i/s and the standard of care systemic therapy.
 - Aim 1b. -Aim 1b. Evaluate the response of HDAC6-score high and low HER2+ cancer cells to a combination
 of HDAC6i/s and standard-of-care systemic therapy.
-Aim 1c. Molecular characterization of tumor response at a tumor-tumor microenvironment (TME) level using sc-
 RNAseq and spatial transcriptomics.
Aim 2. Investigate the mechanisms of resistance to HDAC6i/s in breast cancer cells.
Despite the success of targeted therapies, resistance to treatment can emerge. Here, we will perform both, candidate-
driven and unbiased comprehensive analysis of tissue samples from patients in our trial plus cell lines and PDOs to
catalog and functionally test the molecular differences between sensitive and resistance cancers.
- Aim 2a. Profile the post-translational modifications (PTMs) of c-MYC in HDAC6i-resistant and sensitive BCs.
- Aim 2b. Evaluate the steady-state levels of proteasomal activity in HDAC6i-resistant and sensitive BCs.
- Aim 2c. Network analysis of HDAC6i/s sensitive and resistant BC cells.
- Aim 2d. Increase the specificity of the HDAC6 score with resistance data.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：The search for an HIV cure has been among the highest HIV research priorities for several decades. While
much knowledge was gained regarding the persistent HIV reservoir, HIV eradication remains elusive. There is
an emerging consensus that the HIV reservoir is not a fixed assortment of epigenetically silenced proviruses
but rather a dynamic compendium of mostly defective proviruses. We recently showed that most infections in
primary human CD4+ T memory cell subsets result in non-productive, latent infections. These findings were
made possible thanks to our newly developed HIV vector system, which permits distinguishing and separating
primary human cells harboring non-productive and productive proviruses. Transcriptome analysis of specific
CD4+ T cell subsets identified transcript isoforms differentially expressed in the context of productive and non-
productive infections. We propose an integrated experimental approach that will systematically dissect non-
productive infections in primary human CD4+ T cells. First, we will analyze the proviral structure of non-
productive and productive infections (Specific Aim 1), which will include both integration site analysis as well as
detection of defective proviruses. We will identify and validate the transcriptional programs specific for
productive and non-productive infections using advanced bulk and single cell long read transcriptome analysis
approaches (Specific Aim 2). We will validate findings using genome editing tools and a panel of viral mutants
lacking functional accessory genes. Lastly, we will dissect the role of innate immune responses in the context
of non-productive infections (Specific Aim 3) by determining to what extent stimulation with gamma cytokines
or Type-1 interferon changes the propensity of CD4+ T cell subsets to support non-productive infections.
Collectively, the proposed studies will deliver insights into the interplay between non-productive HIV infections
and host cell environment pointing to the molecular mechanisms that drive non-productive infections in primary
human CD4+ T cells. The results obtained will also provide essential information on potential HIV latency
biomarkers and directly inform of innovative HIV cure strategies.

 I am an Environmental Health Scientist with training in environmental health literacy and global health
and my primary research interests include investigating the role of environmental toxicant exposures,
including mixtures, on child respiratory health and implementing effective strategies to increase
environmental health literacy. The goal of this proposal is to enhance my knowledge and to obtain training in
the skills needed to build my academic career by investigating prenatal pesticide exposure and child lung
function and asthma outcomes, assessing environmental health literacy, and implementing effective
dissemination strategies.
Formal coursework and the expert mentorship of Drs. Kecia N. Carroll, Maria José Rosa, Maida Galvez,
Robert O. Wright, Syam Andra, Shelley Liu, Elizabeth Roberts, and Hector Lamadrid-Figueroa will enable me
to acquire the knowledge and skills necessary to become an independent transdisciplinary researcher. This
training will allow me to achieve my short and long- term career goals: leading efforts to incorporate prenatal
pesticide assessment and environmental health literacy into the ongoing Programming Research in Obesity,
Growth, Environment, and Social Stressors (PROGRESS) cohort based in Mexico City in order to delineate
prenatal pesticide effects on child lung function and asthma while engaging participants and the community
to inform future interventions. I will train in 1) prenatal programming of child lung disease with Drs. Kecia N.
Carroll and Maria José Rosa; 2) toxicology with Drs. Robert O. Wright and Syam Andra; 3) advanced
statistical methods with Dr. Shelley Liu; 4) implementation science, translational research, and community
outreach with Dr. Maida Galvez; 5) ethnographic and qualitative research approaches with Dr. Elizabeth
Roberts; and 5) fieldwork management with Dr. Hector Lamadrid-Figueroa. I will integrate research on
prenatal pesticides, lung function and asthma, and environmental health literacy through interactions with my
mentorship team to become a transdisciplinary scientist. With their guidance, I will establish myself as an
independent investigator with a tenure track faculty position and to position myself for a future R01.
 This proposal will address gaps regarding prenatal pesticide exposure in urban settings particularly in
Latin America, associations with child adverse respiratory outcomes, and factors that may modify
associations, as these are understudied research areas. The proposed research and training plan builds the
foundation for an independent research career that aims to study prenatal environmental exposure effects on
child respiratory health, environmental health literacy, and effective dissemination strategies. This study is
also highly cost effective as we leverage the resources of the longitudinal PROGRESS study with existing
biospecimens, lung function and other respiratory outcomes, and well-characterized covariate data.

This proposal outlines a comprehensive five-year physician-scientist career development plan for Dr. Alice K.
Min. Dr. Min is a third-year Infectious Diseases Fellow in the American Board of Internal Medicine Research
Pathway Residency/Fellowship in Infectious Diseases at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. Her
research focuses on HIV-1 associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND), specifically investigating the role and
function of the endocannabinoid system (ECS) that has well-established anti-inflammatory properties through
activation of cannabinoid receptors type 1 (CB1R) and type 2 (CB2R). Her study proposes that CB2R agonism
reduces neuroinflammation associated with HAND, which currently lacks effective therapies despite affecting up
to 50% of people with HIV-1 (PWH). Findings from this study will enhance our mechanistic understanding of the
anti-inflammatory properties of CB2R in central nervous system (CNS) HIV-1 infection and can lead to novel
therapeutic paradigms for HAND in PWH. This K08 award will provide Dr. Min with advanced training in the
following areas: 1) To develop as an HIV virologist with her own laboratory by taking advantage of the
unparalleled expertise of faculty and fellows at Mount Sinai and collaborators; 2) To communicate, interact, and
collaborate with research colleagues in HIV studies and infectious diseases, in the United States and around the
world; 3) To devote 20-25% of her efforts towards developing skills and knowledge as a clinician in infectious
diseases; and 4) To develop preliminary data that will serve as the foundation for a future R01 that will support
transition to research independence. To achieve these goals, Dr. Min has assembled a multidisciplinary mentor
team. Dr. Talia H. Swartz, her primary mentor, is a successful physician-scientist whose expertise is in pro-
inflammatory comorbidities associated with chronic HIV-1 infection. Her co-mentors are Dr. Benjamin K. Chen,
a renowned HIV-1 virologist and pioneer in HIV-host cell interactions, and Dr. Schahram Akbarian, a
distinguished neuroscientist specializing in epigenomic and epitranscriptomic technologies using mouse models.
An additional scientific advisory committee composed of highly regarded principal investigators in the fields of
stem cell biology, molecular neuroscience, neuropathology, and NeuroHIV will provide additional guidance. Her
mentors and advisory team will guide Dr. Min throughout her training. The proposed experiments and didactics
outlined in this proposal will position Dr. Min with a unique set of interdisciplinary skills and resources that will
enable her to transition to independence as a physician-scientist specializing in NeuroHIV. Dr. Min is firmly
committed to a career in translational NeuroHIV research and is strongly supported in her career and research
goals by her mentors and her division at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：ABSTRACT
Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a poorly understood cutaneous malignancy with viral etiology. Most MCC tumors
feature monoclonal integration of Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCV), which expresses viral T-Antigens (T-Ags).
Small T-antigen (sT-Ag) acts as a transcriptional co-regulator, while Large T (LT-Ag) principally functions to
sequester retinoblastoma protein (RB1) to de-regulate the cell cycle. The T-Ags are responsible for driving
tumorigenesis in T-Ag expressing (T-Ag+) MCC tumors: few mutations are present in T-Ag+ MCC tumors,
including in tumor suppressors RB1 and TP53, whose activities are instead repressed by the functions of the T-
Ags. Latent MCV infection that doesn’t result in T-Ag production is found in a substantial portion of the human
population, however MCC occurs only rarely. Much of what occurs between latent infection and the appearance
of a full-blown T-Ag+ MCC tumor has not been explored due to the lack of in vivo MCC tumorigenesis models.
Among the unanswered questions is how the MCV T-Ags induce a tumor transcriptional program that features
markers of multiple cell lineages, including both epidermal stem cell and neuroendocrine fates.
Previous research in our laboratory determined that SOX9-expressing (SOX9+) hair follicle cells, which give rise
to mechanosensory Merkel cells during fetal development, are also Merkel cell progenitors in adult skin.
Hypothesizing that T-Ags reprogram cells in the Merkel cell lineage to cause MCC, I generated transgenic mice
that express sT-Ag and ablate RB1 to mimic LT-Ag in SOX9+ cells. These mice developed tumors that were not
bona-fide MCC but expressed neuroendocrine markers, making these mice a valuable model in which to study
mechanisms of T-Ag mediated reprogramming. Analysis of tumors at early time points revealed that re-
programming occurred only in specific sub-populations of SOX9+ cells and that reprogrammed cells were highly
apoptotic. Therefore, I hypothesized that specific landscapes of gene accessibility are required for T-Ags to
induce reprogramming from an origin cell and that suppressing p53 mediated apoptosis is required for MCC.
I propose to leverage the model of SOX9-derived, T-Ag driven neuroendocrine tumors to generate novel insights
into the mechanisms of T-Ag mediated reprogramming. I will use integrated epigenetic and transcriptomic
sequencing analyses to characterize the gene accessibility and transcriptional landscape required for T-Ag
mediated reprogramming to occur and identify a native cell type that is competent to undergo reprogramming.
Furthermore, I will study how p53 suppression, which is commonly observed in MCC tumors, contributes to
advancing reprogramming. Altogether, the proposed studies will establish a model of T-Ag mediated
reprogramming in vivo and discover factors that enable T-Ags to reprogram cells. This research will not only
make valuable contributions to the field of MCC research but also to my training by exposing me to molecular
techniques and genomic and epigenomic analyses that are foundational to an independent research career.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：ADAM17 (a disintegrin and metalloprotease 17) is a cell surface metalloprotease with vital roles in
regulating the EGF-receptor as well as TNFa signaling. EGFR-ligands and TNFa are made as membrane-
anchored precursors that must be proteolytically released or “shed” to activate the soluble signaling molecule.
Mice lacking ADAM17 resemble mice lacking the EGFR, providing genetic evidence for the essential role of
ADAM17 in EGFR signaling. Moreover, inactivation of ADAM17 in myeloid cells protects from septic shock in
mice, which is caused by the release of soluble TNFa from myeloid cells. These functions establish ADAM17
as an important potential target for the treatment of EGFR- and TNFa-dependent pathologies such as cancer
and autoimmune diseases. ADAM17 activity is highly regulated and is influenced by numerous signaling
pathways. How these pathways functionally intersect with ADAM17 and how ADAM17 is activated are key
questions that are the main focus of my lab. Previously, we had found that ADAM17 is regulated by its
transmembrane domain (TMD), which ultimately led us to identify the seven-membrane spanning iRhoms1 and
2 (iR1, iR2) as novel regulators of ADAM17. We showed that iR2 controls the function of ADAM17 in immune
cells and that inactivation of iR1 and iR2 abolishes all functions of ADAM17 in mice, thereby providing
biochemical, cell biological and genetic evidence that iR1 and iR2 are the long sought-after regulators of
ADAM17. The main goals of the current proposal are to understand how iR1 and 2 integrate, interpret and
execute the signals that drive the activation of the ADAM17/EGFR- and ADAM17/TNFa signaling pathway.
 In the next 5 years, we will explore the biosynthesis and regulation of the iRhom/ADAM17 complexes and
how they target substrates in a selective manner. We know that the cytoplasmic domain of ADAM17 is
required to stabilize the protein, most likely so that it can assembly with an iRhom in the endoplasmic reticulum
(ER). We would like to identify the factors that stabilize ADAM17 and the sites in ADAM17 and the iRhoms
that promote their interaction. Once the iRhoms have assembled with ADAM17, they move to the cell surface.
We will use mutant iRhoms that are retained in the ER to identify binding partners that regulate their export
from the ER. We will also explore how the substrate selectivity of iRhoms is determined at the molecular level.
Finally, ADAM17 is unique in that it responds rapidly to several different signaling pathways, a property that is
thought to be essential for its role in skin and intestinal barrier protection. We will study the molecular details of
the on/off switch for ADAM17, and generate mice that express a constitutively active ADAM17 that cannot be
activated to determine how important this unique property of ADAM17 is in vivo.
 Together, our planned studies will resolve the most pressing current questions regarding the regulation of
ADAM17, a major cellular sheddase that is critical for TNFa and EGFR signaling and a target for treatment of
cancer and autoimmune diseases, by its recently discovered upstream regulators iR1 and iR2.

Bone homeostasis is maintained by constant and dynamic remodeling between osteoclast-mediated bone
resorption and osteoblast/osteocyte-mediated bone formation. The balance of bone remodeling process,
however, is often disrupted in pathological conditions, such as in osteoporosis and rheumatoid arthritis.
The mechanisms that regulate bone remodeling are not fully understood. Recent genomic studies have
unveiled functional long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), and targeting lncRNAs provided exciting new
diagnostic and therapeutic opportunities for human diseases. The lncRNAs involved in bone remodeling,
however, are underappreciated. Malat1 is one of the most conserved and abundant nuclear lncRNAs. The
function of Malat1 is unknown in bone homeostasis and remodeling. We revealed, for the first time, that
Malat1 KO mice exhibit significant osteoporotic bone phenotype characterized with enhanced osteoclastic
bone resorption, but reduced osteoblastic bone formation in vivo. Thus, Malat1 deletion uncoupled the
normal bone remodeling between osteoblasts and osteoclasts. Malat1 acts cell-autonomously in
osteoblasts to promote osteoblast differentiation, but suppresses osteoclastogenesis in a non-autonomous
manner in vivo. Moreover, Malat1 modulates crosstalk between osteoblasts and osteoclasts.
Mechanistically, Malat1 deficiency significantly reduced nuclear localization of β-catenin during
osteoblastogenesis. The genes enriched in pathways of osteoblast signaling, ossification, and Wnt/β-
catenin pathway were selectively and significantly suppressed in Malat1 KO osteoblasts. These findings
identify lncRNA Malat1 as a novel bone remodeling regulator that impacts skeletal homeostasis by
controlling both bone formation and resorption.
 In this application, we will apply robust genetic approaches to investigate the functional importance
of Malat1 in osteoblast lineage and the mechanisms by which Malat1 regulates osteogenesis and
osteoblast-osteoclast crosstalk. Specifically, we will 1) dissect and define the function of Malat1 in
osteoblast lineage at various stages of differentiation in vivo using genetic approaches; 2) investigate the
mechanisms by which Malat1 regulates osteogenesis and osteoblast-osteoclast crosstalk. Successful
completion of the proposed studies will introduce functional lncRNAs into bone field, yield novel insights
into lncRNA-mediated mechanisms that regulate bone homeostasis and remodeling, and will provide a
rational framework for developing lncRNA-based new or alternative therapeutic approaches for skeletal
diseases.

 There are currently 6.7 million Americans living with dementia and, without significant breakthroughs, this figure will
double to 12.7 million by 2050 (Rajan et al., 2021). There are about 46,000 long-term care (LTC) facilities in the U.S.
(Harris-Kojetin et al, 2016). More than half of LTC residents have some form of dementia (Alzheimer’s Association, 2018).
Responsive behaviors and dysfunction of the dementia care triad—i.e., the PLWD, professional Care Partner (CP), and
Family Member (FM)—are inexorably linked. The emergence of responsive behaviors can lead to disruption of the triad’s
function. Thus, it is imperative to maintain positive relationships and a high quality of life (QoL) within the triad to reduce
BPSD. Cognitive Stimulation Therapy (CST) has demonstrated improvements in QoL and relationships for PLWD. CST is
a psychosocial intervention that promotes communication and engagement in PLWD via a structured program of meaningful
and enjoyable themes (Woods, et al, 2012). While clinical trials have shown improvement in cognition and QoL, the
potential large-scale impact of CST has been hampered by low adherence, with less than 40% completing trials (Rai, et al,
2018). One likely reason for the low adherence to CST is the reliance on generic and non-digital tools (e.g., paper-based
agendas, tools, DVDs, and board games) in facilitating the intervention. That is, even though CST aims to be personalized,
the specific interventions used in the field tend to be generic and not tailored to each PLWD’s specific interests. The use of
digital technology to implement CST would offer considerable advantages to expand and personalize the range of
stimulation content and provide a means for monitoring responses, optimizing protocols, and promoting adherence.
 The proposed Phase II study will involve the continued development and evaluation of a multi-faceted software platform
called “Building Relationships using Artificial Intelligence and Nostalgia” or BRAIN. The BRAIN Platform will be the
first-ever Artificial Intelligence (AI) powered CST digital therapy platform for PLWD. The platform, which has been shown
to be effective in an initial Phase I clinical trial, has three main goals: to improve the quality of life of PLWD, to reduce
BPSD in PLWD, and to foster positive relationships between members of the care triad. The proposed Phase II project has
the following Specific Aims: 1. Create an improved Beta version of the BRAIN Platform’s eight components: (1) the Admin
Management Dashboard, (2) the Annotation Dashboard, (3) the Log Viewer, (4) the Content Management System (CMS),
(5) the Private CMS, (6) the Control App, (7) the Home App, and (8) the Training Dashboard. 2. Fine-tune the different
classes of AI algorithms—i.e., behavioral analytics, personalized content recommendation, and personalized program
generation—in the BRAIN app such that they can (a) recognize and track 12 distinct behaviors and indicators of PLWD,
(b) use these behavioral traits as a basis for automatically rating the relative success of each activity, and (c) automatically
recommend personalized activities that are likely to be successful for individual PLWD. 3. Conduct a Cluster Randomized
Trial (CRT) of the BRAIN App to examine the app’s impact on engagement/affect, quality of life, and responsive behaviors.
4. Examine satisfaction and ease of use of the app for PLWD, LTC staff, and FMs.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Activated synovial macrophages (M[phi]s) are major producers of pathogenic cytokines, and play a key role in
RA pathogenesis. The long term goals of this project are to understand mechanisms that regulate the
balance between activating and feedback inhibitory signaling pathways that are activated in human M[phi]s by
inflammatory factors that drive RA synovitis. An associated goal is to use this knowledge to therapeutically
modulate balance and crosstalk between signaling pathways to promote resolution of inflammation.
 Important activators of RA synovial M[phi]s include autocrine TNF, immune complexes, T cell factors,
and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) generated by tissue damage and cell death. DAMPs
that activate Toll-like receptors (TLRs), which are amongst the most potent activators of M[phi]s and
inflammatory genes such as TNF, IL6, and IL1B, have emerged as important drivers of RA synovial M[phi]
 activation. RA synovium contains abundant DAMPs including nucleic acids (NAs) derived from dying cells
that activate intracellular RNA and DNA sensors. Interestingly, RA synovium also abundantly expresses
molecules that bind NAs and potentiate activation of endosomal NA-sensing TLRs (eTLRs: TLR3/7/8/9).
 Of the eTLRs, TLR7 and TLR8 are highly expressed in RA synovial macrophages, potently drive
inflammatory cytokine production including in RA synovial explants, and have been most closely implicated
in pathogenesis of RA and inflammatory arthritis models. Human TLR8 is selectively expressed in myeloid
cells and potently drives inflammatory cytokine production, but has been relatively understudied as mouse
TLR8 is non-functional; interestingly, BAC-transgenic mice expressing human TLR8 (hTLR8) exhibit
increased arthritis associated with erosive synovitis, high TNF, and macrophage infiltration that models RA.
 In the previous project period we focused on regulation of the balance between activating and
feedback inhibitory pathways downstream of TNF and TLR8 in human M[phi]. We found that the balance of
TLR8 signaling was shifted towards superinduction of inflammatory genes including TNF and IL6 by CXCL4,
which is highly expressed in RA synovium. CXCL4 was previously shown to augment eTLR-mediated IFN
and cytokine production in DCs by binding NAs and promoting their delivery to endolysosomal
compartments. We identified novel and complementary mechanisms whereby CXCL4 activated signaling
and chromatin remodeling in human M[phi]s to boost TLR8 responses. Our overarching hypothesis is that
CXCL4 and eTLRs like TLR8 cooperatively activate signaling and epigenetic mechanisms that result in
synergistic inflammatory gene activation, and that these mechanisms are operative in activated RA synovial
M[phi]s. We propose to investigate mechanisms underlying CXCL4-TLR8 synergy and their pathophysiological
implications for inflammatory arthritis. We anticipate our studies will yield insights that can be used to
attenuate pathologic M[phi] super-activation while leaving basal TLR responses intact for host defense.

Photoreceptor loss due to degenerative retinopathy is a leading cause of adult vision loss. Transplantation of
photoreceptor precursor cells (PPCs) into adult retina is an exciting strategy for replacing lost photoreceptors
and restoring vision in mice. However, a major obstacle to advancement of this approach is extremely limited
migration of transplanted cells through the interphotoreceptor matrix (IPM) and into the retina. Our laboratory
has discovered, that PPCs express a number of migratory receptors which guide migration to retinal ligands in
vitro. We hypothesize that receptor-driven, haptotactic and chemotactic mechanisms can be exploited to
optimize PPC migration through the IPM and into the retina. Our first goal in this project is to characterize PPC
haptotaxis to bound IPM ligands and chemotaxis to soluble retinal ligands using our established bioinformatics
database and microfluidics platform. We will characterize chemotaxis driven by the top three expressed PPC
receptors to their corresponding soluble retinal ligands, KDR-VEGF, PDGFR-PDGF, and RET-GDNF,
receptors-ligands respectively. And we will analyze haptotaxis driven by the top two haptotactic PPC receptors
ITGAM and ITGB1 to IPM ligands chondroitin sulfate and fibronectin. Next, we will examine the extent to which
modulation of haptotactic and chemotactic receptors will increase migration in vitro and in a rhodopsin
knockout, degenerative retinopathy retina model ex vivo. Lastly, we will analyze receptor protein levels of
PPCs migrated into the IPM and retina to validate our current data and define novel mechanisms of PPC
migration. The combined cross-disciplinary approach will provide data to move PPC transplantation forward for
the restoration of vision.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a multisystem autoimmune disease characterized by high morbidity and
mortality, and largely ineffective treatments. SLE is genetically complex with strong familial aggregation and high
heritability. Most of the risk alleles for SLE are not protein-coding sequence changes, suggesting that a significant
portion of disease risk is mediated by regulatory variants in the noncoding genome. At a recently identified
intergenic SLE risk locus on chromosome 12q12, our in silico analyses implicate the risk variants as eQTLs that
impact transcription of genes in multiple biological pathways that contribute to SLE immunopathology, including
type I interferon (IFN) and anti-viral genes. This intergenic SLE risk locus is enriched in regulatory elements and
resides adjacent to several long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) genes. In this proposal, we outline a comprehensive
set of mechanistic and functional experiments to understand the role of the 12q12 risk locus in human immune
cells. We hypothesize that several variants within cis-regulatory elements at the 12q12 locus alter the expression
of adjacent lncRNAs, which in turn exert cis and trans effects on immune system genes resulting in increased
SLE risk. An alternate hypothesis is that the 12q12 locus could be a long-range enhancer for nearby protein-
coding and/or non-coding genes. These hypotheses are not mutually exclusive, and our experimental design will
detect each possibility. In Aim 1, we will determine the overall impact of the intergenic 12q12 locus on gene
regulation in primary immune cells and selected cell lines. Integrative analyses will be used to infer lncRNA
influences on mRNA networks. Candidate lncRNAs from these analyses will be knocked down with siRNAs to
confirm their function. In Aim 2, we will identify causal cis-regulatory elements in the intergenic 12q12 region.
We will use complementary methods to identify likely regulatory elements, and putative causal elements will be
knocked out in cell lines to confirm function and reversion to a non-risk cellular phenotype. We expect to find that
the intergenic 12q12 locus influences the expression of adjacent lncRNAs and/or neighboring protein-coding or
non-coding genes in a cell type-specific manner, resulting in simultaneous modulation of multiple biological
pathways involved in SLE pathogenesis. This knowledge could suggest novel therapeutic targets for SLE that
would influence multiple pathogenic pathways. This represents a novel mechanism of disease in SLE and
provides an illustration of how intergenic risk variants can function in complex disease pathogenesis.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Macrophage (MΦ)-driven inflammation is at the core of autoimmune diseases including rheumatoid arthritis
(RA), signifying imbalance between circuits that turn inflammatory genes on and off. The `on' state is conferred
by transcription factors such as NFκB that activate basal transcription machinery and chromatin at pro-
inflammatory enhancers and promoters. An equally robust `off' signal is conveyed by the glucocorticoid (GC)
receptor (GR) which, upon ligand binding, tethers to NFκB and represses its targets. Notably, these genes
form distinct classes: those for which RNA polymerase (Pol) II recruitment and transcription initiation are rate-
limiting, and those whose promoters are pre-loaded by initiated but paused Pol II and pause-enforcing factors,
NELF and DSIF. Pause-release requires the positive elongation factor, P-TEFb, a kinase that phosphorylates
Pol II, NELF and DSIF leading to NELF release and productive elongation. Importantly, assembly of the Pol II-
NELF-DSIF `paused complex' is tightly regulated by another kinase, CDK7. To date, the role of post-initiation
control of transcription in immunity and disease is unknown. Our preliminary data in MΦ reveal transcriptome-
wide Pol II pausing and unexpectedly dynamic behavior of NELF upon inflammatory stimulation. NELF deletion
dramatically shifted the balance of pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators and blunted inflammatory responses
over time. The pausing complex is also a critical target of GC - the cornerstone of anti-inflammatory therapies.
Although basal machinery and chromatin were once considered too general to be `druggable', pioneering work
in cancer research uncovered the benefits of targeting epigenetic regulators and, more recently, CDK7. In RA,
the transformation of the synovial lining into aggressively proliferating cartilage- and bone-invading tissue is
often viewed as malignant. Like tumor cells, synovial MΦ enter a state of transcriptional dependency with a few
super-enhancers dominating the inflammatory transcriptome. These data point to CDK7 inhibition as a novel
promising avenue to treat RA as a monotherapy or in combination with GC. Our objective is to dissect the
specific contribution of post-initiation control to inflammation - in MΦ and in mouse models of RA. Our central
hypothesis is that pausing plays an essential `permissive' role in MΦ-driven inflammation by constraining anti-
inflammatory gene expression. We further propose that genetic and pharmacologic manipulation of Pol II
pausing will yield important insights into the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases such as RA, with potential
to be translated into advances in patient care. Our Specific Aims are to: 1. Dissect the role of the pause-
release checkpoint in inflammatory gene induction in MΦ; 2. Evaluate early elongation and higher-order
chromatin interactions in MΦ as targets for GR; 3. Assess the utility of manipulating elongation control in vivo
using inflammatory arthritis models. The successful completion of this project will: i) reveal the contribution of
Pol II pausing to inflammatory MΦ activation; ii) help refine the anti-inflammatory actions of GC; iii) uncover the
potential of new therapeutic strategies targeting the early elongation checkpoint in preclinical models of RA.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are photosensitive, demonstrating an increased skin
sensitivity to ultraviolet radiation (UVR) whereby even ambient exposure to sunlight can result in the
development of inflammatory skin lesions. Beyond the skin, however, UVR exposure can also trigger systemic
disease flares, with increased circulating autoantibodies and further injury of end organs. The mechanisms by
which UVR exposure at the skin can lead to flares of systemic autoimmunity are not well understood. Our
long-term goal is to delineate the mechanisms that connect photosensitivity with systemic disease flares. Skin
communicates with the immune system via lymphatic vessels which serve both to remove interstitial fluid from
skin and bring antigens and mediators to regulate draining lymph node immune function. Compromised
lymphatic flow results in increased and prolonged skin inflammation and alters the signals that reach the lymph
nodes, resulting in autoantibody generation over the long term. The importance of lymphatic flow in both skin
and lymph node regulation led us to examine lymphatic flow function in SLE. We show evidence of
compromised lymphatic flow in human SLE and multiple mouse models and that improving lymphatic flow in
SLE models reduces skin photosensitivity and draining lymph node plasmablast responses. Our goal with this
proposal is to understand the mechanisms by which lymphatic flow regulates draining lymph node immune
responses in lupus-like disease. We show preliminary data that improving lymphatic flow increases lymph
node fibroblastic reticular cell (FRC) expression of CCL2, driving the FRC-monocyte-plasmablast axis that
limits plasmablast survival. Improving lymphatic flow also downregulated skin interferon-I (IFN-I)-stimulated
gene expression and upregulated FRC CCL2 was dependent on the NOX2 subunit of NADPH oxidase.
Improving lymphatic flow additionally upregulated FRC expression of IMP2, an RNA binding protein that
detects N6-methyladenosine RNA modifications and stabilizes CCL2 mRNA, and regulatory T cell
accumulation in lymph nodes. These data suggest the following hypothesis: Improving lymphatic flow
reduces IFN-I signaling, upregulating FRC NOX2-mediated reactive oxygen species generation that drives an
IMP2-mediated program of FRC alterations. The resulting FRC CCL2 upregulation modulates monocyte and
regulatory T cell function in lymph nodes, limiting B cell responses. Our aims are to 1) delineate the
relationship between IFN-I and Nox2 in regulating FRC CCL2, 2) Understand the extent of contributions of
IMP2 to lymphatic-driven FRC phenotypic alterations, and 3) understand the mechanisms by which lymphatic-
driven FRC regulation reduces B cell responses. The proposal will help us understand how lymphatic function
contributes to lupus-like disease and delineate mechanisms by which FRCs are regulated and shape lymph
node function, paving the way to better understanding the relationship between photosensitivity and
autoimmunity.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Macrophages play a key role in the pathogenesis of various autoimmune and rheumatic diseases.
An important mechanism by which activated macrophages contribute to disease pathogenesis is production
of inflammatory cytokines such as TNF, IL-1 and IL-6. These cytokines are canonical NF-B target genes
and validated therapeutic targets. The long term goals of this project are to understand how inflammatory
macrophage activation is regulated, with the associated goal of developing new therapies that selectively
suppress pathogenic macrophage functions, while preserving homeostatic functions and host defense.
 Type I IFNs and IFN- are important regulators of immunity and inflammation. IFNs activate the JAK-
STAT signaling pathway to induce canonical interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). Expression of IFN target
genes (termed an ‘IFN signature’) is one of the most prominent molecular pathways activated in several
autoimmune diseases including RA, lupus nephritis, and macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) (and
related familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (fHLH)). IFNs are clearly pathogenic in monogenic
‘interferonopathies’ and fHLH, where patients are responsive to JAK inhibitors and IFN- blockade. JAK
inhibitors, which target IFNs amongst other cytokines, are effective in RA and are being tested in SLE.
 Although IFNs do not directly activate pathogenic non-ISG inflammatory NF-B target genes such
as TNF, IL1B and IL6, they potentiate induction of these genes by TNF and TLRs. This supports the
possibility that the therapeutic efficacy of IFN blockade or Jak inhibitors may be mediated at least in part by
direct suppression of inflammatory cytokine production in macrophages. In accord with this notion, JAK
inhibitors decrease inflammatory responses and cytokines in RA patients, primed human macrophages, RA
synovial macrophages and tissue explants, and in preclinical models of arthritis and MAS/fHLH.
 In the previous project period we found that IFN-JAK-STAT signaling induces chromatin remodeling
at inflammatory NF-B target genes to make these genes hyper-responsive to inflammatory signals and
resistant to suppression. IFNs also selectively suppressed components of the macrophage response to the
suppressive cytokine IL-10 by deactivating enhancers. These data provide insights into pathways that
connect IFN-JAK-STAT signaling to inflammatory NF-B target genes and support our overarching
hypothesis that IFNs help drive inflammatory non-ISG gene expression via chromatin-based mechanisms.
 In this project we will investigate epigenetic mechanisms by which IFNs drive macrophage activation
and expression of pathogenic NF-B target genes such as TNF, IL1B and IL6, and mechanisms by which
JAK inhibitors suppress these genes. We anticipate that our studies will yield insights that can be used to
develop novel therapeutic strategies to suppress inflammatory responses, and help understand how
epigenetic mechanisms can contribute to poor efficacy of therapies that target upstream signaling pathways.

repair, and resolution of inflammation. The long term goals of this project are to understand how
macrophage functional phenotypes are regulated to balance host defense and inflammation with
homeostatic functions that resolve inflammation and restore tissue integrity. An associated goal is to
therapeutically modulate macrophages to promote tissue repair while minimizing inflammatory pathology.
 Macrophages assume various phenotypes dependent on ontogeny, tissue-specific factors,
epigenetic programming, and (micro)environmental challenges. Inflammatory macrophages produce
cytokines such as TNF and IL-1 that are important for host defense and inflammation, while reparative and
pro-resolution macrophages produce suppressive and growth factors such as IL-10, VEGF and PDGF
important for tissue repair, wound healing and resolution of inflammation. Recent high dimensional analyses
using flow/mass cytometry and single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) have revealed distinct macrophage
populations and functional phenotypes in different tissues and disease states.
 Wound healing typically progresses through inflammatory, tissue repair, and tissue remodeling
stages. Both inflammatory and repair phases, and a well-regulated balance and transition between them,
are important for effective wound healing. Excessive inflammation, such as occurs in chronic TNF-driven
inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), results in ineffective repair and chronic wounds.
Immune cells including macrophages play important roles in the first two phases of wound healing, and
modulation of macrophage function to improve tissue repair is an emerging therapeutic strategy.
 In the previous project period we investigated mechanisms of crossregulation between the
inflammatory factor TNF and the repair factor IL-4, using primary human macrophages and mouse models
of wound healing. While IL-4 suppressed components of the TNF inflammatory response, the two cytokines
synergized to induce genes associated with resolution of inflammation. The balance between an
inflammatory and reparative macrophage phenotype was regulated in part by SREBP transcription factors.
Myeloid inactivation or pharmacological inhibition of SREBPs accelerated wound healing. scRNAseq
identified novel macrophage populations induced by injury and associated with tissue repair. These data
provide insights into mechanisms that regulate the transition from inflammation to repair, and support our
overarching hypothesis that selective modulation of the immune system can be utilized to improve tissue
repair. In this project we will investigate mechanisms that regulate the balance and transition between
inflammation and tissue repair. We anticipate that our studies will yield insights that can be used to develop
novel therapeutic strategies to enhance wound healing and restore tissue function.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are photosensitive, demonstrating an increased skin
sensitivity to ultraviolet radiation (UVR) whereby even ambient exposure to sunlight can result in the
development of inflammatory skin lesions. Beyond the skin, however, UVR exposure can also trigger systemic
disease flares, with increased circulating autoantibodies and further injury of end organs. The mechanisms by
which UVR exposure at the skin can lead to flares of systemic autoimmunity are not well understood. Our
long-term goal is to delineate the mechanisms that connect photosensitivity with systemic disease flares. Skin
communicates with the immune system via lymphatic vessels which serve both to remove interstitial fluid from
skin and bring antigens and mediators to regulate draining lymph node immune function. Compromised
lymphatic flow results in increased and prolonged skin inflammation and alters the signals that reach the lymph
nodes, resulting in autoantibody generation over the long term. The importance of lymphatic flow in both skin
and lymph node regulation led us to examine lymphatic flow function in SLE. We show evidence of
compromised lymphatic flow in human SLE and multiple mouse models and that improving lymphatic flow in
SLE models reduces skin photosensitivity and draining lymph node plasmablast responses. Our goal with this
proposal is to understand the mechanisms by which lymphatic flow regulates draining lymph node immune
responses in lupus-like disease. We show preliminary data that improving lymphatic flow increases lymph
node fibroblastic reticular cell (FRC) expression of CCL2, driving the FRC-monocyte-plasmablast axis that
limits plasmablast survival. Improving lymphatic flow also downregulated skin interferon-I (IFN-I)-stimulated
gene expression and upregulated FRC CCL2 was dependent on the NOX2 subunit of NADPH oxidase.
Improving lymphatic flow additionally upregulated FRC expression of IMP2, an RNA binding protein that
detects N6-methyladenosine RNA modifications and stabilizes CCL2 mRNA, and regulatory T cell
accumulation in lymph nodes. These data suggest the following hypothesis: Improving lymphatic flow
reduces IFN-I signaling, upregulating FRC NOX2-mediated reactive oxygen species generation that drives an
IMP2-mediated program of FRC alterations. The resulting FRC CCL2 upregulation modulates monocyte and
regulatory T cell function in lymph nodes, limiting B cell responses. Our aims are to 1) delineate the
relationship between IFN-I and Nox2 in regulating FRC CCL2, 2) Understand the extent of contributions of
IMP2 to lymphatic-driven FRC phenotypic alterations, and 3) understand the mechanisms by which lymphatic-
driven FRC regulation reduces B cell responses. The proposal will help us understand how lymphatic function
contributes to lupus-like disease and delineate mechanisms by which FRCs are regulated and shape lymph
node function, paving the way to better understanding the relationship between photosensitivity and
autoimmunity.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Background: This proposal is designed for Dr. Kimberly Lakin, MD, MS to grow toward becoming an
independent investigator focused upon characterizing the clinical significance of immune cell-fibroblast
associations in systemic sclerosis (SSc) skin. Currently, there are no approved treatments to manage both skin
and internal organ fibrosis caused by systemic sclerosis (SSc), a deadly autoimmune disease with a complex
and poorly understood pathophysiology involving inflammation and excess collagen production by skin
fibroblasts. In clinical and trial settings, some patients improve, at times dramatically, while others do not,
possibly related to distinct disease phases when cells are amenable (or not) to treatment. Reliable tools are
needed to inform individualized treatment decisions and trial enrollment. Preliminary data by Dr. Lakin and her
mentors suggest assessments of fibroblast activation status may yield such a tool.
Preliminary data: Using paired biological (histology, gene expression) and clinical data from 24 individuals with
diffuse cutaneous (dc)SSc, histologic assessments of two, inversely related fibroblast markers (aSMA, CD34)
were associated with clinical severity and predicted the SSc inflammatory gene expression subset, using
machine learning methods. Samples with inflammatory vs. non-inflammatory fibroblasts had increased B cells
and type I interferon gene signature. A gene signature of fibroblast polarization (by aSMA/CD34) was
computed and found to be higher at baseline in 52-week clinical improvers vs. non-improvers.
Methods: Fine phenotype mapping of dcSSc (n=105), preSSc (Very Early Onset of SSc; n=12) and healthy
(n=12) skin will be performed cross-sectionally. Immune pathways and cell types associated with activated
fibroblasts will be evaluated by imaging mass cytometry (IMC), digital cell deconvolution, and histology. In a
longitudinal analysis, baseline clinical and molecular features (histology scores; immune cell and fibroblast
polarization signatures) will be tested as inputs in a model to predict 52 weeks clinical improvement.
Career Development: The study goal is to unravel immune cell-fibroblast interactions in SSc and to test a
histology-derived model for classifying patients most likely to clinically improve at one year. Dr. Lakin is an
assistant attending physician at Hospital for Special Surgery (HSS) and assistant attending professor of
medicine at Weill Cornell Medical College with access to the outstanding core services at these institutions.
She will conduct patient-oriented research under the mentorship of Dr. Robert Spiera (HSS), an expert in SSc
clinical research, and Dr. Dana Orange (Rockefeller), an expert in the use of bioinformatic approaches to
discover patient subsets in rheumatic diseases. Dr. Lakin will engage in experiential and formal coursework to
advance her bioinformatics, immunology, and skin imaging mass cytometry skills. This career development
award will position Dr. Lakin for success in her objective to become an R01-funded independent investigator
focused upon improving SSc patient care while uncovering key mechanisms of SSc pathogenesis.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
Leading to over 270,000 deaths in the US annually, septicemia is the systemic inflammatory response to a
bloodstream infection (BSI). Early diagnosis and treatment of BSIs have demonstrated improved patient
outcomes and reduced hospitalization time. However, currently accepted diagnostic approaches have not
advanced substantially since the advent of automated blood culturing systems. As such, today’s gold-standard,
is not only slow, requiring ~1-3 days, but also demonstrates reduced sensitivity in the presence of antimicrobial
treatment. There is therefore a significant need for new diagnostic approaches that do not require culture and
provide faster, more accurate results.
To address this unmet need, HelixBind developed RaPID/BSI, a fully automated sample-to-answer test which
identifies and characterizes BSIs directly from blood in ~3 hours, without cultures. Implemented on the RaPID
(Resistance and Pathogen IDentification) platform and appropriate for placement throughout the hospital,
RaPID/BSI incorporates a broad test menu of 21 bacterial and fungal pathogens and is not compromised by prior
antimicrobial treatment. Species level detail is provided with single CFUs/ml sensitivity, enabling selection of
appropriate antimicrobials. Commercialization of RaPID/BSI will provide timely characterization of BSIs and
thus enable intervention with targeted antimicrobial treatment. This is expected to result in improved patient
outcomes and a reduction in the use of unnecessary antimicrobials, slowing the rise of antimicrobial resistance.
Reflecting RaPID/BSI’s significant advantages over exiting alternatives and the potential to improve care and
quality of life, the FDA designated RaPID/BSI a Breakthrough Technology in 2020.
HelixBind has met and exceeded all of the Specific Aims defined in the Phase II SBIR. This included assay
optimization, automation of the assay onto a single-use plastic disposable operated by a benchtop instrument
and testing of clinical specimens. Clinical results demonstrating >94% sensitivity and 99.8% specificity across
the assay far surpassed our milestone of 90% sensitivity and 90% specificity. In addition, based on feedback from
potential customers, the test menu was expanded from 16 to 21 pathogens and the capability to detect resistance
mechanisms was demonstrated.
Given the success of Phase II, HelixBind proposes in this Commercialization Readiness Pilot program proposal
to mature the manufacturing of the RaPID/BSI disposable; ensuring quality and sufficient scale to support
regulatory clearance and initial launch. In addition, this proposal will support the expansion of the RaPID
Analyzer’s software suite, addressing core issues as cyber security and connectivity to hospital Electronic Health
Records in a HIPAA compliant manner. Upon completion of this project, we will be well placed to initiate formal
Analytical and Clinical studies for FDA clearance of RaPID/BSI.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
Infective Endocarditis (IE) occurs when bacteria or fungi adhere to the endocardial surface forming small lesions.
This invasive disease is characterized by a mortality rate exceeding 25%, is associated with extended
hospitalization, and often impairs the quality of life for those who survive. Early microbial diagnosis and
antimicrobial intervention are crucial to improved patient outcomes and reduced hospitalization time. However,
currently accepted diagnostic approaches still rely on primary blood culture, which exhibits long and variable
turnaround times and are prone to false-negative results. There is therefore a significant need for new diagnostic
approaches that do not require culture and provide faster, more accurate results.
To address this unmet need, HelixBind developed RaPID/IE, a fully automated sample-to-answer test which
identifies and characterizes these infections directly from blood in ~3 hours, without cultures. Implemented on
the RaPID (Resistance and Pathogen IDentification) platform and appropriate for placement throughout the
hospital, RaPID/IE incorporates a broad test menu including both bacterial and fungal pathogens, as well as a
marker of antimicrobial resistance. Crucially, the test is not compromised by prior antimicrobial treatment and
provides species level detail with single CFUs/ml sensitivity, enabling selection of appropriate antimicrobials.
Commercialization of RaPID/IE will provide timely identification and characterization of the invasive agent and
thus enable intervention with targeted antimicrobial treatment. This is expected to result in improved patient
outcomes and a reduction in the use of unnecessary antimicrobials, slowing the rise of antimicrobial resistance.
HelixBind has met and exceeded all the Specific Aims defined in the Phase II SBIR. This included menu
expansion to cover antibiotic resistance as well as pathogens associated with IE which cannot be recovered by
clinical cultures, automation of the assay onto single-use disposables operated by a benchtop instrument, and
successful completion of a preliminary clinical study. In addition, and based on feedback from potential
customers, the menu was expanded further to include coverage of pathogens associated with conditions sharing
symptoms with IE. Additional analytical testing was performed to ensure the assay meets product specifications.
In this proposed Phase IIB, HelixBind will build on our success in Phase II to advance RaPID/IE by addressing
potential risks associated with direct from blood detection of antimicrobial resistance, increasing the product’s
room-temperature shelf life, and completing a prospective clinical study on-site at a partner hospital. Upon
completion of this project, we will be well placed to initiate analytical and clinical studies for FDA premarket
notification and clearance of RaPID/IE.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：The advanced stage of Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias is characterized by the onset infections,
which prior work suggests are widely mismanaged. Antimicrobials are extensively prescribed, most often
without evidence to support a bacterial infection. Antimicrobial exposure is the main factor leading to multidrug-
resistant organisms (MDROs); a growing public health threat. Moreover, the benefits of antimicrobials remain
unclear for patients with advanced dementia, for whom infections are often a terminal event and comfort is
most commonly the goal of care. In 2015, our group completed a prospective study of nursing home (NH)
residents with advanced dementia, the Study of Pathogen Resistance and Exposure to Antimicrobials in
Dementia (SPREAD) (parent NIH R01 for this competing renewal). Antimicrobials were prescribed for 72% of
suspected infections, but only 44% episodes met guideline-based criteria for treatment. Criteria were more
likely to be met when proxies were counseled about antimicrobials. Two-thirds of residents were colonized with
MDROs. Antimicrobial use was the major risk factor for MDRO acquisition. Motivated by these findings, the PIs
conducted a pilot study (NIH R21) of an intervention to improve management of suspected urinary (UTIs) and
lower respiratory tract infections (LRIs). With this foundation, the goal of this proposal, TRAIN-AD (Trial to
Reduce Antimicrobial Use In Nursing home residents with Alzheimer’s disease and other Dementias), is to
conduct a cluster randomized controlled trial of the intervention among 480 residents with advanced dementia
(N=240/arm) in 16 Boston-area NHs (N=8/arm). The intervention has two main components: 1. Provider
Training: In-person training, on-line course, management algorithms, and prescribing feedback, and 2. Proxy
Education: booklet. Unlike most antimicrobial stewardship programs, the intervention merges best practices in
infectious diseases and palliative care, and targets a unique population for whom the need to improve infection
management is particularly compelling. The Aims are to compare the following 12-month outcomes between
residents in the intervention and control arms (usual care) related to suspected UTIs and LRIs: Aim 1. total
number of antimicrobial courses/person-year (10 outcome); Aim 2. number of antimicrobial courses prescribed
when guideline-based criteria for treatment are absent/person-year (20 outcome), and Aim 3. i. advance care
planning about infection management, and ii. burdensome procedures/person-days used to evaluate these
episodes/person-year (20 outcomes). IMPLICATIONS: Prior work by our group has demonstrated a critical
need to improve the quality of care for suspected infections in advanced dementia patients. A cluster RCT of
an intervention to optimize infection management is the next logical step. This proposal addresses 3 federal
research priorities: Alzheimer’s disease, palliative care, and antibiotic stewardship. Thus, it has the potential to
make clinical and policy-relevant contributions by promoting patient-centered end-of-life care for millions of
Americans with advanced dementia, and reducing the growing public health threat of MDROs in NHs.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Delirium, an acute disorder of attention and cognition, is a common, life-threatening, and costly condition for
older adults with strong links to Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD). In 2015, responding to
RFA-AG-16-009, we created the Network for Investigation of Delirium: Unifying Scientists (NIDUS I,
R24AG054259), a collaborative interdisciplinary network of 28 investigators spanning 27 institutions which has
provided research resources, meetings, pilot grants, and intensive mentorship for >90 trainees, leading to >340
first author papers and >46 grants as principal investigator. Despite this progress, a major knowledge gap in
the field remains: safe and effective treatments for delirium. Thus, in response to PAR-20-071, we propose to
expand the existing infrastructure as NIDUS II to advance the fundamental science needed to develop more
effective treatments for delirium, and ultimately, improve outcomes for delirium in all older adults and in those
with ADRD. Our specific aims are: (1) Harmonization Core. To develop and expand innovative measurement
methods related to harmonization of delirium measures, outcomes, and predictors for clinical studies and
treatment trials, and to refine measures of delirium diagnosis and severity in patients with all stages of ADRD.
These approaches will allow us to combine data from multiple existing delirium studies; (2) Research
Resources Core. To develop and expand the NIDUS Research Hub to create a collaborative infrastructure
that will seed future interdisciplinary studies to advance delirium research (e.g., biomarker studies, intervention
development studies); (3) Pilot/Exploratory Studies Core. To award pilot and exploratory grants that will
promote collaborative interdisciplinary studies designed to utilize our infrastructure and advance research
needed to develop better treatments for delirium. For this aim, we will assemble collaborative working groups
(WG) which will address 4 scientific priority areas: (a) Measurement: Harmonize and refine measurement of
delirium and related outcomes, including patients with ADRD, and to ensure accurate and sensitive measures
for treatment trials; (b) Pathophysiology: Biomarker and mechanistic studies to advance our understanding and
identify potential therapeutic targets for treatment trials; (c) Clinical Trials: Intervention development for new
multicomponent treatment approaches; (d) Inter-Relationship of Delirium and ADRD: Epidemiologic, risk factor,
pathophysiologic, prognostic, and especially treatment studies; (4) Career Development and Outreach Core:
for early-stage investigators who will utilize the NIDUS II infrastructure and will be involved in working groups,
pilot studies, and training events. Every aspect of NIDUS II is designed to seed innovative scientific discovery,
and drive delirium research in a critically important direction: development of effective treatments for delirium,
including delirium in ADRD. While we are building on the previous network, the innovation of the new NIDUS II
network is the purposeful application and expansion of the infrastructure to advance scientific exploration and
impact in specific priority areas of greatest benefit to older Americans.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：The vascular supply is critically important to the skeleton, yet the clinical implications of vascular dysfunction for
skeletal fragility are poorly understood. Studies demonstrate associations between vascular disease and
osteoporosis in older adults. However, it is unknown whether vascular dysfunction itself underlies these
associations. We propose to use subclinical vascular tonometry and hemodynamic measures to test the
hypothesis that vascular impairments negatively affect cortical bone microarchitecture increasing fracture risk in
the cortical-rich peripheral skeleton. Our preliminary data demonstrate that vascular changes are associated with
increased fragility fractures and deficits in cortical bone microstructure, as assessed by high-resolution peripheral
quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT). These data provide strong rationale for our proposed work,
particularly since no previous studies have comprehensively investigated mechanistic measures of blood flow in
both large arteries and microcirculation in relation to skeletal fragility. Our long-term goal is to improve
understanding of skeletal fragility in older adults to reduce the burden of fractures, by focusing on how aging
related changes in the vasculature affect the peripheral skeleton. Our central hypothesis is that individuals with
more severe aortic stiffness and blunted peripheral hyperemic flow response will have more severe deterioration
in cortical bone microarchitecture, loss of bone strength, and higher incidence of fracture. Advanced imaging
techniques, such as HR-pQCT, provide volumetric skeletal compartment specific measures of volumetric bone
density and microarchitecture, while non-invasive vascular tonometry and hemodynamics lend key insight into
the origins of large artery and microvascular deficits. Together, these innovations provide necessary tools to
advance knowledge of the vascular mechanisms underlying skeletal fragility, and will identify novel targets for
fracture prevention. Thus, in the unique setting of the Framingham Heart Study, we will address the following
specific aims: (1) Determine the contribution of vascular function to incidence of fracture, and (2) Determine the
contribution of vascular function to longitudinal changes in bone density, microarchitecture, and strength. Using
state-of-the-art assessments of vascular dysfunction and cortical bone deficits, the investigative team has the
experience and complementary areas of expertise to successfully carry out the specific aims. By identifying the
vascular mechanisms underlying skeletal fragility, this project has the potential to be paradigm shifting, providing
new targets for interventions to reduce the tremendous public health burden of fractures in our older population.

competencies also trained in patient-oriented research. My overarching goal is to grow the field of young
investigators properly trained in patient-oriented aging research, and to improve the health of frail, older adults
through my research efforts focused on unintentional injury. For more than ten years I have had funding from
the NIA to study injurious falls in frail, older adults, and for the past six years I have served as the Program
Director for the Harvard Multicampus Geriatric Medicine Fellowship. The current proposal will capitalize on my
strengths as an independent clinical investigator with expertise in injurious falls and program leader to enhance
my capacity to mentor early investigators in aging research. The specific aims of the current proposal are to 1)
conduct high-quality research on preventing unintentional injuries in frail, older adults that will serve as a
platform to engage early investigators in patient-oriented aging research; 2) grow the number of well-trained
investigators skilled in studying unintentional injury in older adults; and 3) enhance my skills to lead and mentor
early clinical investigators by completing formal didactic training focused on implementation science and
leadership. Ongoing funded research projects that could serve as a platform to engage research trainees
include a large observational study to determine the risks and benefits of antihypertensive, antihyperglycemic,
and anticoagulant drugs in older adults with Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD), as well as a
feasibility trial to develop and implement an intervention to prevent injurious falls in older nursing home
residents. Additionally I have conducted research and continue to collaborate with investigators using several
large datasets that will serve as an excellent resource for trainees. Potential mentees will be identified from a
pipeline of existing training programs at Harvard Medical School including the Geriatric Medicine Fellowship,
Translational Research in Aging Programs (T32), and others. I will develop an individualized mentoring plan
with all trainees, including the design of an original hypothesis-driven research project, plan for individualized
and group mentorship, and opportunities for coursework/didactics to enhance research training. Finally, I will
boost my own mentoring skills through 1) formal didactics and directed reading on implementation science; 2)
directed reading/coursework on mentorship; 3) a leadership course; 4) a course on preventing burnout; and 5)
additional coursework (e.g., introduction to genetics) to expand my scientific inquiry. A Senior Advisory panel
will provide feedback on my performance as a mentor and leader. In summary, this Career Development
Award will provide me with the practical experience and formal didactic training to expand my capacity as a
researcher, leader, and mentor in patient-oriented research on unintentional injury, including patients with
ADRD. At the end of this 5-year award, I will have equipped at least 18 early investigators in the study of
unintentional injury, many of whom will enter the field of aging research.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
My career goal is to lead efforts to improve gait rehabilitation and mitigate falls risk in older adults by
conducting innovative research focused on the neural control and enhancement of gait and mobility. I am
particularly interested in developing individualized, multi-modal, and patient-centered interventions that can
both stand alone and be combined with current evidenced-based geriatrics rehabilitation programming.
Though walking is a repetitive task, one’s temporospatial patterns of movement during walking vary from stride
to stride. This gait variability, if sufficiently high, is predictive of both falls and cognitive decline in older adults.
Still, the neural mechanisms that give rise to gait variability are not completely understood. We thus lack
effective interventions to minimize gait variability in older adults. However, our team has demonstrated that in
older adults, those with elevated gait variability exhibit worse ability to sustain performance on a continuous
cognitive task over time (i.e., sustained attention). My work has also linked gait variability to the functional
connectivity between the two large-scale brain networks believed to underserve sustained attention—namely,
the dorsal attention network (DAN) and the default network (DN)—in multiple cohorts of older adults. Based
upon these discoveries, we designed a novel multi-channel transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)
intervention to simultaneously facilitate the excitability of the DAN and inhibit the excitability of the DN. Our
preliminary data suggests that a single exposure to this tDCS, as compared to sham, reduces gait variability
when tested just following stimulation. My overarching hypothesis is that this form of tDCS can modulate the
functional connectivity between the DAN and DN and thus reduce gait variability in older adults. In this project,
we will test this hypothesis by examining the acute after-effects of a single session of tDCS on resting-state
functional connectivity (Aim 1), as well as determining the effects of a multi-session tDCS intervention on gait
variability and related outcomes (Aim 2). We will recruit 30 older adults free of major disease that exhibit
higher-than-typical gait variability. Participants will first complete a baseline assessment and two fMRI visits.
The same participants will then be randomized to a tDCS intervention arm (ten, once-daily, 20-min sessions) or
a ShamàtDCS intervention arm (five, once-daily, 20-min sessions of sham in week one followed by five, once-
daily, 20-min sessions of tDCS in week 2). The primary outcome of gait variability will be assessed daily using
a validated smartphone app for the entire study period. We expect to demonstrate that tDCS can modulate
functional connectivity and reduce gait variability in older adults. The results from this project are expected to
inform the design of a larger, more definitive trial of tDCS designed to optimize brain connectivity as it relates
to gait variability in older adults. This research, combined with specific training in advanced neuroimaging and
neuromodulation, cognitive neuroscience in aging, and the conduct a clinical research in vulnerable older
adults, will greatly facilitate my efforts to transition into an independence clinician scientist.

 In older adults, diminished lower-extremity somatosensation is highly prevalent and a primary contributor
to poor balance, reduced mobility, and increased risk of falling. The vast majority of research and clinical efforts
to date have attempted to improve somatosensation by restoring the function of peripheral elements of the
somatosensory system. However, somatosensation is also dependent upon the capacity to activate the
appropriate cortical networks in response to a given stimulus, which is also altered in older adults. Therapeutic
strategies aimed at enhancing the excitability of the somatosensory cortical network thus offer untapped
potential to improve foot-sole somatosensation in this population. Our preliminary studies suggest that a single
session of traditional transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), which produces a diffuse electric field over
the primary somatosensory cortex, improves foot-sole somatosensation in older adults. In this K01 Award, we
will first work to identify the specific cortical network that is responsive to walking-related foot-sole stimulation
in older adults with and without foot-sole somatosensation (Aim 1). We will use a block-design functional MRI
paradigm with a custom-designed, MRI-compatible foot sole stimulation system to apply individualized
pressures to the participant’s foot soles that mimic those experienced when they walk, yet while they lay
motionless in the scanner. Based upon this knowledge obtained from Aim 1, we will develop a novel multi-
target tDCS intervention targeting the identified cortical network and test the effects of a single session of this
intervention on foot-sole somatosensation, balance and mobility in older adults with mild-to-moderate foot-sole
somatosensory impairments (Aim 2). We will then use participant brain MRIs and electric field modeling to
establish the “dose-response” relationship between on-target current intensity induced by tDCS and its acute
effect on the cortical response to foot sole stimulation (Aim 3). Through this work we will learn about how
chronic lower-extremity somatosensory impairments influence the cortical processing of sensory feedback
involved in the control of balance and mobility, demonstrate that such processing can be modulated by tDCS,
and thus, obtain critical information needed to design a larger more definitive trial to test the potential for tDCS
to improve foot sole sensation, balance, and mobility in this population. This career development award will
provide me with unique training experiences in neurophysiology of somatosensation in aging, the clinical care
of these older adults, and increase my expertise in advanced neuroimaging and brain stimulation techniques,
which, taken together, will greatly facilitate my efforts to transition into an independent academic scientist.

 The polymorphic transporter OATP1B1 plays significant roles in the hepatic uptake and disposition of
endogenous molecules and drugs. Further, OATP1B1 is involved in numerous drug-drug interactions (DDIs) due
to its multispecificity. Despite decades of research, many factors related to the determinants of ligand binding,
transport mechanism and energetics, as well as the structure of this important transporter are unresolved. The
long-term goal is to characterize hepatic transport at the microscopic and macroscopic levels. Due to the
functional importance of OATP1B1 in liver clearance, this is the first target studied. The central hypothesis is that
structures of human OATP1B1 and functional assays performed on isolated proteins will unequivocally define
the mechanism of ligand binding, transport, and inhibition. The rationale that underlies this research is that
protein structures coupled with unambiguous, reproducible activity assays are absolutely required to fully
characterize the mechanism of transport and resolve long-standing conflicting data reported in the literature.
Establishing robust expression and purification protocols for human OATP1B1 facilitates pursuing the two
Specific Aims: 1) Resolve structures of OATP1B1 by Cryo-EM and analyze their motions by MD simulations. 2)
Functionally characterize the transport mechanism of OATP1B1. For the 1st Aim, the optimal conditions that
result in the highest image quality for Cryo-EM of OATP1B1 would be screened, and data would be acquired in
the presence and absence of ligands. The Cryo-EM studies will be augmented by MD simulations and docking
studies that would reveal details that are not accessible by mere structural analysis. The different biochemical
conditions (apo and holo) increase the likelihood of A) solving the structural determinants of the binding of various
ligands (with distinct chemistries) to the two ligand-binding sites of OATP1B1. B) solving the structures of multiple
conformations that are part of the transport cycle. For the 2nd Aim, we will use purified protein reconstituted into
proteoliposomes to characterize the inherent properties of OATP1B1 such as the energizing ion for transport,
the influence of the membrane voltage, and pH. Those results would be compared with cellular assays that
include intact cellular machinery, and other plasma membrane transporters that might directly or indirectly affect
OATP1B1. The research proposed in this application is innovative, in the applicant’s opinion because it
introduces two methodologies that have never been explored for any OATP isoform. These could uncover a
plethora of novel insights into the structure/function relationship of OATP1B1. The proposed research is
significant since OATP1B1 is involved in DDIs of several commonly prescribed drugs, sometimes resulting in
life-threatening situations. This study would unravel the exact determinants of ligand binding to OATP1B1 and
transport. Ultimately, the structural and functional knowledge generated here has the potential to aid in the design
of drugs that exhibit a lower propensity for DDIs.

In recent decades, the emergence of antibiotic resistance in bacteria has greatly outpaced the discovery of novel
antibacterial agents. This research is focused on the synthesis and biological study of antibiotics effective against
these modern pathogens of urgent threat. To this end, the lincosamides have been identified as an
underexploited class of antibiotics. No new lincosamide has entered the market since clindamycin was approved
more than 50 years ago (FDA, 1970). Growing resistance to clindamycin and its propensity to induce life-
threatening Clostridioides difficile (C. difficile) colitis have limited its utility in today’s armamentarium. Due to the
structural complexity of this class of natural products, semi-synthetic strategies are insufficient to support future
antibiotic drug discovery within this or related scaffolds. Here, efficient synthetic pathways will be developed and
implemented to prepare a large collection of lincosamide analogs inaccessible by any other means. These
include analogs of a lead candidate, iboxamycin, which features a novel bicyclic oxepanoprolinamide scaffold
and is efficacious in vitro and in vivo against a broad range of multi-drug resistant (MDR) bacteria. The latter
include MDR ESKAPE pathogens (Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae,
Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter spp.), identified by the WHO as targets
of highest priority in antibiotic development. By elucidating the mechanistic underpinnings and drivers of in vivo
efficacy of iboxamycin and future lead antibiotics, this research will deliver multiple novel antibiotic scaffolds for
preclinical exploration to target these challenging pathogens.

The overall project goal is to investigate zinc supplementation in combination with standard antibiotic therapy
as a simple, low-cost, and readily available intervention to improve survival and treatment outcomes for
Tanzanian young infants hospitalized with ‘clinical severe infection’ as defined by WHO IMCI criteria. To meet
these goals, we propose to conduct a ‘gold standard’ randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of zinc
supplementation in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.
Briefly, we will enroll 3,250 Tanzanian young infants (0-59 days) hospitalized with clinical severe infection in
Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. All young infants will receive standard antibiotic treatment and will be randomized to
receive a 14-day course of twice-daily oral 5 mg elemental zinc supplements (10 mg per day) or a matching 14-
day course of a twice-daily placebo regimen. Participants will be followed-up for 90 days to assess vital status
and treatment outcomes. We will also collect biological specimens to evaluate potential mechanisms of action
and assess modification of any treatment effect by etiology of infection. The primary outcomes of the trial are
i) 90-day all-cause mortality and ii) Treatment failure (composite endpoint of death, a new requirement for life
support or need to change to second-line antibiotics). The secondary outcomes of the trial include a) time to
cessation of signs and symptoms of clinical severe infection, b) time to hospital discharge, c) risk of re-
hospitalization and d) 90-day change in nutritional status as assessed by length-for-age, weight-for-length, and
weight-for-age z-scores.
Evidence from this randomized trial is urgently needed as low-cost and high-impact innovation to improve
young infant survival will be required for Tanzania and other developing countries to reach the child mortality
Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) by 2030.

Malaria caused by infection with Plasmodium vivax is an enormous public health burden throughout the world,
and the cause of significant morbidity. The antimalarial drug chloroquine is the first line of drug treatment for P.
vivax in most countries, and has proven highly efficacious. However, chloroquine resistant (CQR) P. vivax
infections have been widely reported, seriously hampering case management, malaria control efforts, and
elimination programs. Most work on resistance mechanisms has focused on Plasmodium falciparum, while P.
vivax remains poorly studied; nevertheless, P. vivax poses a major impediment to eradication. The molecular
determinants of CQR and resistance to other antimalarials in P. vivax remain unclear, largely due to the lack of
in vitro culture, precluding reverse genetics and robust drug assays. Several candidate drug transporter genes
have been identified in P. vivax with polymorphism in sequence and expression level that could be associated
with CQR and/or resistance to other antimalarials. These genes include pvmdr1, pvcrt-o and pvmrp1, orthologs
of the Plasmodium falciparum pfmdr1, pfcrt and pfmrp1 genes, respectively, that are key determinants of
antimalarial susceptibility in P. falciparum. Ex vivo P. vivax susceptibility to chloroquine is associated with specific
P. vivax drug transporter polymorphisms in some but not all studies. It is not clear whether these discrepancies
represent regional differences in parasite diversity and history of exposure to drugs; or result from technical
differences, as no genetic validation has hitherto been possible. Here, we propose a comprehensive analysis of
drug-resistance polymorphisms of P. vivax, utilizing two novel approaches leveraging the zoonotic macaque
parasite Plasmodium knowlesi, which is much closer to P. vivax phylogenetically than is P. falciparum; possesses
superior in vitro genetics with higher transfection efficiencies; and importantly, permits robust determinations of
antimalarial drug susceptibility. We aim to utilize both cutting-edge evolutionary genomic and experimental
forward genetic screening to identify putative determinants of P. vivax drug-resistance. We will subsequently use
in vitro reverse genetic methods in P. knowlesi to functionally assess the importance of prioritized P. vivax genetic
polymorphisms in mediating antimalarial drug-resistance. We hypothesize that these polymorphisms, either
singly or in combination, have been selected in specific regions of the world by antimalarial use against P. vivax.
The identification of specific polymorphisms that mediate different levels of susceptibility to chloroquine, and
other antimalarial compounds in current clinical use, including artemisinin and its partner drugs, will be key to
their use in surveillance, molecular epidemiological studies, and the design of strategies to prolong the
usefulness of these drugs.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT ABSTRACT
Malaria parasites are transmitted by the bite of female Anopheles mosquitoes. Current malaria
control strategies rely extensively on the use of antimalarial drugs as human therapeutics, and on
long-lasting insecticide-treated bed nets (LLINs) and insecticide indoor residual sprays of house
walls (IRS) to target the Anopheles mosquito. LLINs and IRS play a key role in malaria prevention,
accounting for more than 70% of all cases prevented in the last two decades. However, these
interventions suffer from the alarming spread of insecticide resistance emerging in most Anopheles
populations in sub-Saharan Africa, which threatens their effectiveness. Combined with the emergence of
drug resistance in Plasmodium parasites, these issues stress the need for new tools to prevent malaria
transmission. In a recent study we have built the foundation for a novel malaria control strategy based on
combining antimalarials with mosquito-targeting interventions. Our idea proposes to incorporate antimalarials
on mosquito nets or other surfaces such as walls, so that female Anopheles landing on these surfaces will
uptake the antimalarial compounds via their legs the way they generally uptake insecticides on LLINs or IRS.
As a proof of principle, we coated a glass substrate with the potent antimalarial atovaquone (ATQ), a
cytochrome b inhibitor, and allowed Anopheles gambiae females to rest on this surface for a few minutes
immediately prior to P. falciparum infection. Strikingly, P. falciparum development was completely
abrogated in females exposed to low concentrations of ATQ (EC50 = 1.77 µmol/m2). Parasite
development was also completely aborted when mosquitoes were exposed to ATQ 24 hours prior to or
12 hours post infection, and when ATQ was deposited on a net substrate, demonstrating the broad
potential of this approach. Other cytochrome b inhibitors showed similar effects. In this project, we will
validate the use of antimalarials to kill P. falciparum in the Anopheles female. Specifically, we will: Aim 1)
screen a library of antimalarials to identify additional compounds that kill P. falciparum upon uptake by
the mosquito, in collaboration with Medicine for Malaria Venture (MMV), the Malaria Drug Accelerator
(MalDA) and others; Aim 2) determine the ability of ATQ and hit compounds from our screens to kill drug-
resistant P. falciparum parasites, in collaboration with MalDA and Dyann Wirth at the Harvard Chan
School; and Aim 3) assess whether insecticide resistance mechanisms operating in the mosquito affect
uptake and efficacy of ATQ, in collaboration with the Institut de Recherche pour le Développement (IRD,
Burkina Faso) and the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine. By combining compound screens with
laboratory and field analyses, our project will validate the use of compounds with antimalarial activity in the
mosquito vector, aiding in the generation of an innovative malaria control tool.

This application is responsive to RFA-ES-18-009: Maintain and Enrich Resource Infrastructure for
Existing Environmental Epidemiology Cohorts
Project Viva is a Boston-area cohort of 2,128 mother-child pairs from whom we have collected information on
numerous environmental exposures and health outcomes beginning in early pregnancy in 1999-2002. Our
almost two decades of data thus traverse numerous sensitive periods of the lifecourse: from gestation though
adolescence for index participants, and from pregnancy into the perimenopausal period for their mothers. Our
rich database comprises detailed information on a wealth of environmental exposures including daily air
pollution exposure estimates from satellites, local monitors, and geographic information systems; measures of
built and natural environments; biomarkers of toxicants including per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS)
and metals; and maternal and child diet. Existing research-quality outcomes include measures of
cardiometabolic health for both mothers and children (anthropometry, body composition, blood pressure, and
biomarkers of glycemia, lipids, and adipokines); child cognition and behavior; child lung function and atopy; as
well as genetic variants and epigenetic markers.
The overall goals of the current proposal are to 1) bolster retention of Project Viva index participants through
adolescence into the young adult transition, 2) build infrastructure for future science through development and
implementation of remote data collection methods using modern technology, with a focus on environmental
exposures, and 3) enhance our data management infrastructure to facilitate data sharing with the broader
scientific community. These activities will complement our existing active grants supporting data collection and
analysis, including participation in the NIH’s Environmental Influences on Child Health Outcomes (ECHO)
Program.
The wealth of data and biosamples already available in Project Viva provide a unique opportunity to continue
to advance the research priorities of NIEHS, including examining the influence of early-life environmental
exposures, alone and in combination with other exposures and genetics, on development of chronic disease.
The proposed infrastructure activities will improve the availability of Project Viva data to the wider research
community, while simultaneously supporting our efforts to maintain this valuable resource and position our
cohort to examine novel scientific questions in the future. The enhanced infrastructure will also provide a
scalable foundation to support ongoing enrichment of the Project Viva protocols and datasets.

 To reduce the unmet health care needs among children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD), one
state-level policy response has been legislations that require private health insurers to provide coverage for
ASD-related services, known as state autism insurance mandates. By 2019, insurance mandates were
enacted in all states and the District of Columbia. Several studies have documented substantial variations in
state autism insurance mandates. However, there is a paucity of evidence about whether children with ASD in
the states with more generous mandates have fared better than those living in the states with more limited
mandates. Identifying this evidence is of critical importance given the fact that children with ASD have complex
health conditions and require affordable, comprehensive insurance coverage to meet their health care needs
either under normal circumstances or during unusual times, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. It is also
unknown which specific mandate policy features matter most for reducing unmet needs among this group of
children and maintaining or increasing their health care utilization during the pandemic.
 This proposed project aims to fill the evidence gaps by examining each of these issues. Our goal is to
contribute to the knowledge base that can inform decision-making on health care financing for children with
ASD. Specifically, we will carry out the following Aims: (1) Use national survey data to assess the extent to
which more generous state autism mandates improve health care access and reduce unmet needs for children
with ASD before the COVID-19 pandemic, (2) Use nation-wide insurance claims data to assess the extent to
which more generous state mandates increase service utilization and spending for children with ASD, by
setting (outpatient, ED, inpatient, home) and care type (medical, behavioral, pharmacy), before the pandemic,
and (3) Use both national survey and claims data to assess whether and to what extent more generous state
mandates help maintain or increase access, utilization, and spending for children with ASD from before to
during the pandemic.
 To examine the Aims, we will adopt difference-in-differences and triple-differences approaches, both of
which are rigorous quasi-experimental designs. The proposed study is unique in examining how health care for
children with ASD is affected by the generosity of state mandates in general and by type of mandate policy
feature in specific. The proposed study is timely since its findings have the potential to inform policy-making on
expanding insurance benefits and closing coverage gaps for children with ASD as the nation fights the
pandemic and potentially embarks on new rounds of health system reform. Our study results will also be
relevant to broader debates around optimal design of essential health benefits, a topic of great interest to
policy-makers and researchers, especially in the past decade.

Depression is the most common mental illness in the U.S. affecting nearly 40 million adults age 18 years and
older. Women are more likely to be affected by depression than men. Depression has both genetic and
environmental influences. Depression is a polygenic disorder (due to the combined effects of many genetic
variants) and depression rates differ by sex. The relationship between genes and depression is complex and
influenced by sex. Thus, understanding the shared genetic basis of sex-specific differences for depression has
great potential to lead to new biological understanding of the etiology of depression in females compared to
males and to promote the development of novel and more effective pharmacotherapies.
The underlying goal of this proposal is to develop and evaluate methods to examine the role of sex in genetic
association studies of depression. These methods will be applied to the UK Biobank. The UK Biobank is one of
the largest biobanks available at present and represents an extensive resource with both genetic data and
depression phenotypes (approximately 474,000 participants). The Mass General Brigham Biobank
(approximately 33,000 participants) will be used for validation and assessment of the robustness of the
approaches.
The grant focuses on methods development applied to depression and the role of sex in genetic association
studies of depression; however, our ultimate goal is to develop approaches that are applicable to a broad range
of mental health and addiction phenotypes. We will also create publicly available software packages to
implement these new approaches, so that they will be broadly accessible to the scientific community.

 Compared to heterosexual women, sexual minority women (i.e., those with same-sex attractions,
same-sex behavior, and/or a lesbian/gay/bisexual identity) are vulnerable to poor gynecological health; for ex-
ample, they are more likely to experience sexual assault and to encounter barriers to care. Yet, despite the
mounting evidence of these gynecological disparities, little is known about the extent to which obstetrical and
perinatal health differ across sexual orientation groups. This gap is especially troubling since sexual minorities
have more risk factors (e.g., depression, substance use, obesity) for adverse obstetrical and perinatal out-
comes compared to heterosexuals. Few data are available to adequately quantify sexual orientation-related
obstetrical and perinatal health disparities, but preliminary results from small, cross-sectional datasets reveal
striking disparities: sexual minority women experience twice the number of pregnancies ending in miscarriage
and stillbirth and twice the number of children born extremely preterm and low birthweight compared to hetero-
sexual women. Quantifying such disparities necessitates the use of large, longitudinal datasets to better inform
interventions. This project's objective is to address the knowledge gaps in sexual orientation-related obstetrical
and perinatal health by collecting and analyzing national data from three unique, longitudinal, intergenerational
cohorts. The Nurses' Health Study 2 (NHS2) began in 1989 when our research group enrolled female nurses
aged 25–42 years (now 56–73 years). In 1996 and 2004, our research group enrolled NHS2 offspring aged 9–
16 years (now 25–39 years) into the Growing Up Today Study (GUTS). These cohorts comprise almost
150,000 participants with nearly as many pregnancies, including >30,000 pregnancies among sexual minori-
ties. The proposed project will leverage existing data—including nuanced sexual orientation data—to identify
new pregnancies among GUTS participants during the height of their reproductive years and collect data about
a third generation: the offspring of GUTS participants. Combining these new and existing data will enable us to
fill critical gaps, for example by detailing outcomes across different generations and sexual orientation sub-
groups (e.g., bisexuals, lesbians). This study will quantify the obstetrical health of sexual minority and hetero-
sexual women as well as the perinatal health of children born to sexual minority and heterosexual women.
Drawing on the Minority Stress Model, the study will also identify mediators and moderators of sexual orienta-
tion-related differences in obstetrical and perinatal health. By collecting detailed, longitudinal data across three
generations with data on obstetrical/perinatal outcomes as well as mediators and moderators, the proposed
research is a substantive, innovative departure from the status quo. This project will produce the first thorough
evaluation of obstetrical and perinatal health of a neglected population—sexual minority women and their off-
spring—and will have a positive impact by revealing the needs of these vulnerable groups, informing targeted
interventions and improving the health of subsequent generations.

Integration of genomic sequencing into everyday medical practice has already begun. In our first funding period,
Precision Medicine Policy and Treatment Model (PreEMPT) I, we began exploring the benefits and risks
associated with genomic sequencing in newborns, which has compelling logic: It can provide clinically actionable
insights to prevent illness altogether or to facilitate early detection of illnesses in childhood or adulthood.
Notwithstanding the clinical utility of newborn genomic sequencing and cascade testing of family members,
questions remain: cost-effectiveness of newborn genomic sequencing, long-term effects on disease morbidity
and mortality, and diagnostic and treatment-related costs. These knowledge gaps are important to fill, given
expectations about widespread applications of genomic sequencing.
Our proposed research will create PreEMPT II by extending our existing computer microsimulation model
developed in PreEMPT I to reflect the impact of newborn genomic sequencing on a wider array of childhood-
onset diseases and their long-term consequences into adulthood. Additionally, we will refine our approach to
considering the impact of targeted screening of siblings of children with pathogenic variants. Previously, we
developed a framework to evaluate newborn genomic sequencing for pediatric cancer and cardiac diseases. In
this renewal, we will extend this framework to evaluate the clinical benefits and cost-effectiveness for metabolic
diseases such as Pompe disease and biotinidase deficiency, and other diseases such as malignant
hyperthermia. To highlight critical knowledge gaps, we will use value of information analysis to identify high-
priority research studies within the rapidly evolving area of genomic medicine with a focus on addressing race-
based health disparities. We will enhance our existing simulation model to synthesize the best available clinical,
epidemiologic and economic data, and use our analytic framework to project both short- and long-term outcomes
associated with alternative screening strategies and assess the potential value of genomic sequencing in
reducing racial disparities in disease outcomes.
Our interdisciplinary team includes experts in simulation modeling, health economics, genomics, pediatrics,
predictive modeling, health policy, and health systems research. We propose a highly innovative application of
modeling methods to genomic technologies with the goal of synthesizing available clinical and epidemiological
data into a unified modeling effort. The goal is to project long-term outcomes by incorporating evolving data in
the area of genomic sequencing for newborns, permitting ready evaluation and guidance for clinical care in the
United States over the next decades.

Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are persistent “forever chemicals” that contaminate water and food
and are detectable in almost every individual in the US. Despite a manufacturer’s voluntary phase-out, efforts
to limit production have been incomplete, and there is no US federal legislation to regulate PFAS, in part due to
a lack of longitudinal data on policy-relevant health outcomes. In particular, high-quality data are limited from
studies among older adults, a population rapidly expanding, and in which altered metabolism, decreased
clearance, and hormonal changes may heighten PFAS vulnerability. In our highly productive first funding cycle,
we reported associations of higher plasma PFAS with greater insulin resistance, cholesterol, abdominal
adiposity, and diabetes risk in midlife. These intermediates presage poorer health in older age, including low
muscle mass and strength, low bone mass, and cardiovascular disease (CVD). In this competing renewal R01,
we propose to expand our prior work to test our hypothesis that higher and more prolonged exposure to PFAS
increases risk for poor musculoskeletal and cardiovascular health in older adults. In addition, we will test a
secondary hypothesis that builds on our first funding cycle finding that randomization to an exercise and dietary
lifestyle intervention mitigated the effect of PFAS on cardiometabolic risk. We hypothesize that we can identify
specific lifestyle factors (e.g., healthier, anti-inflammatory diet higher in omega-3 fatty acids and lower in fat)
that will attenuate health effects of PFAS, information important for the growing number of communities
identified with high PFAS levels due to contamination and industrial use. We will again leverage the
unparalleled resources of the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP)/Diabetes Prevention Program Outcomes
Study (DPPOS), a long-term cohort study nested within a randomized trial. We will leverage the PFAS results
from our first funding cycle, perform additional assays to address new hypotheses and increase sample size
(n=~1400), and benefit from the study’s wealth of high quality, longitudinal data on covariates, CVD, and aging-
relevant outcomes carefully collected over 20 years during critical windows of aging. In Aim 1, we will examine
prospective associations of PFAS with muscle strength (e.g., hand grip) and DXA measures of muscle and
bone mass. In Aim 2, we will examine prospective associations of PFAS with incident adjudicated CVD events.
In Aim 3, a secondary aim, we will examine effect modification of PFAS-outcome associations by study arm
and specific lifestyle factors. By examining longitudinal PFAS exposure across midlife and older age and by
employing sophisticated statistical methods to examine individual PFAS and PFAS mixtures, we will overcome
limitations of the few existing studies of PFAS, musculoskeletal health, and CVD. Our findings will inform PFAS
legislation and health guidance for exposed individuals, with implications for musculoskeletal health and
cardiovascular risk reduction.

Label to Table: New Insights into Supermarket Food Labeling is a comprehensive, real-world evaluation of
nutrition labeling policies and programs that impact all Americans who purchase food. Nutrition labeling provides
information on food and beverage nutrients and healthfulness and is intended to help individuals compare
products and make healthier dietary choices. The study will use supermarket transaction data, an experiment in
a naturalistic online supermarket, and surveys of shoppers’ experiences while shopping in supermarkets to
determine whether and how these labeling programs improve the nutritional quality of purchases. We will
evaluate two nutrition labels: 1) the Nutrition Facts Label, a nutrient-based label mandated for all packaged
goods sold in the US, that was updated in 2016 and required to be implemented by 2021, and 2) Guiding Stars,
a shelf-tag labeling system identifying healthy foods with 1 to 3 stars that is used in nearly 2000 US supermarkets
and was revised in 2021.
In the first two Aims of the project, we will use comprehensive transaction data linked to nutritional information
from a supermarket chain located in five Northeastern US states with nearly 12 million transactions monthly.
These data, available from 2016 to 2023, will allow us to evaluate the implementation of the new Nutrition Facts
Label and updates to the Guiding Stars labeling system. In Aim 3, we will explore an expansion of Guiding Stars
to include labels of both healthier and unhealthier foods and beverages in a virtual supermarket study of 3100
individuals, followed by an evaluation of these expanded labels in two actual supermarkets. In Aim 4, we will
enroll 3000 shoppers who participate in a national consumer panel and use novel technologies to track when
they have shopped and survey them about their use of labels while shopping for different products. Having real-
time data will allow us to investigate whether use of labels is associated with healthier choices and if this
relationship differs by the race, ethnicity, education, and household income of shoppers. We also will conduct
detailed interviews with 30 of these shoppers to learn more about their experiences shopping and using labels,
with a focus on social and cultural factors that influence supermarket purchases and use of labels. This study
will be one of the first to use real-world data to investigate these labels and will use innovative methods and
technologies. Because of the expansive nature of this evaluation, we expect that results will help inform
policymakers, retailers, and manufacturers regarding how labels can improve the diet quality of Americans.

 Unmet need for child mental health services is a persistent and pressing public health problem in the US.
One of the key drivers of the unmet need is health workforce shortage, which has been exacerbated during the
COVID-19 pandemic. This exacerbation has occurred against the backdrop of rising mental disorders among
children, leading to the national emergency in child mental health declared by multiple specialty organizations.
 At the same time, the pandemic has also stimulated innovations, including the widespread adoption of
telehealth, which has been promoted by recent government policies. Although telehealth has long been
advocated for improving health care access for vulnerable populations, such as children living in mental health
professional shortage areas (MHPSAs), no study to date has examined how the recent dramatic growth of
telehealth affects mental health care availability and utilization for children in MHPSAs. Furthermore, amid the
rapid transition to telehealth during the pandemic, some experts have been concerned with disparities in
telehealth access and utilization and called for further research on the equitable development of telehealth.
 In response to that call, this proposed project aims to draw lessons about telehealth adoption during the
pandemic to inform future telehealth policies. As a comprehensive evaluation of state telehealth policies on
licensure, insurance coverage, and reimbursement, the proposed project has three aims: (1) mental health
treatment facility (MHTF) level analyses to assess how changes in state telehealth policies affect disparities in
mental health service availability for children from before to during the pandemic, (2) child level analyses to
evaluate how changes in state telehealth policies affect disparities in mental care access, utilization, and
spending among children from before to during the pandemic, and (3) qualitative interviews with medical
directors at MHTFs to understand their experiences using telehealth to serve children as well as facilitators and
barriers that they have identified for expanding telehealth in MHPSAs.
 For each aim, we will analyze two types of disparities—by area of residence (e.g., MHPSAs vs. non-
shortage areas), and by child socio-demographic characteristic (e.g., race/ethnicity). Examining these
disparities is crucial given the concern about digital health equity during the pandemic.
 To examine the aims, we will analyze quantitative data from both primary and secondary sources,
including our unique longitudinal survey of nearly all MHTFs in the US. We will also collect complementary
qualitative data through interviews with medical directors at MHTFs.
 The proposed study is both timely and important, as state policymakers are considering actions to
revise their telehealth policies. The study findings will help them identify policies that have (or haven’t) been
successful in expanding telehealth services for children with mental disorders—especially those who live in
MHPSAs—to inform subsequent policy decisions.

Over 40% of US adults have obesity, many with weight-related complications such as hypertension and diabetes.
Current clinical guidelines suggest lifestyle change as the first-line obesity treatment approach, but this does not
produce sustained clinically-significant weight loss for the majority of patients. Bariatric surgery is available for
patients with more severe obesity, but due to its cost, invasiveness and risk, only 1-2% of eligible patients
undergo a procedure. Addressing the obesity epidemic using only lifestyle change programs and bariatric
surgery will continue to leave most patients without a successful long-term treatment option. Anti-obesity
medication (AOM) is an option that could help to fill the current obesity treatment gap. Recent trials have
demonstrated that AOMs lead to enduring clinically-significant weight loss, with a good safety profile. However,
many physicians remain hesitant to prescribe AOMs due to concerns about their effectiveness and safety. There
is also a complete lack of comparative effectiveness data on contemporary AOM options. Studies addressing
these issues could inform treatment choices, guidelines, and pharmacy benefit development, significantly
impacting clinical practice. We will use a nationwide commercial insurance claims dataset that includes over
350,000 unique adults with new AOM fills (data current through early-2022) to conduct the first nationwide
comparative effectiveness study of AOMs. We will compare propensity score-matched cohorts of patients
prescribed one of six FDA-approved AOMs between 2012 and 2027: phentermine, phentermine-topiramate-ER,
liraglutide, bupropion-naltrexone-SR, semaglutide, and tirzepatide (pending approval 2023). Our primary design
will use intention-to-treat analyses on new users with at least one AOM fill, but we will also conduct on-treatment
and per-guidelines analyses among patients with persistent AOM use. Our Specific Aims are to compare groups
of patients prescribed these AOMs, over up to 5 years of follow-up, with respect to: (1) Major cardiovascular
events; (2) Other clinical outcomes related to reduction in body weight, including (a) incidence of type 2 diabetes
(T2D), hypertension and dyslipidemia; and (b) Change in intensity of T2D, hypertension and dyslipidemia
pharmacotherapies (including discontinuation of therapy); and (3) Health care services use and associated costs,
including annual hospital days; emergency department visits; outpatient visits; and pharmacy, lab, and medical
costs. In an exploratory Aim, we will examine whether key patient characteristics (age, sex, baseline T2D,
comorbidity burden) modify the risks or benefits seen with each AOM. Comparative effectiveness studies
examining major clinical and health services outcomes beyond weight loss are needed to inform guidelines and
policy. Our use of a large, existing, regularly updated dataset will allow us to efficiently produce rapid-turnaround
real-world results that are highly generalizable and likely to have a significant impact on treatment of a chronic
disease that affects nearly half of American adults.

Over 80% of adolescents with type 1 diabetes (T1D) struggle to achieve good glycemic control, placing them at
risk for acute and chronic complications. Instilling good T1D management practices in adolescence can set a
pattern into adulthood, improving long-term health while reducing future burden on patient and family quality of
life, adolescent psychosocial development, and the health care system. Health psychology and economics
research suggest that financial incentives can increase adolescent adherence to T1D self-management
regimens. We developed InvesT1D, a flexible, patient centered incentives intervention based on rigorous
developmental research that included qualitative, ethical, and stated preference analyses. A pilot randomized
controlled trial (RCT) demonstrated that InvesT1D was effective at improving adherence to self-management
goals and time-in-range among continuous glucose monitor users. We propose a larger, more comprehensive
study to determine the most efficacious financial incentive structure and to evaluate InvesT1D’s impact on
time-in-range, HbA1c, adverse events, long-term health, diabetes distress, family conflict, health care
utilization, and adolescent and caregiver quality of life. In this hybrid effectiveness-implementation study, we
will use mixed methods to evaluate InvesT1D’s efficacy, long-term health benefits, cost-effectiveness, and
implementation feasibility. Our interdisciplinary team’s innovative approach includes an RCT, trial- and model-
based economic evaluations (from the payer, health care, and societal perspectives), a policy analysis, the
development of a decision support dashboard, and qualitative interviews with patient, health care payer, and
health care delivery system stakeholders. Methodologic contributions of the InvesT1D study can make a
significant contribution to the scientific approach for developing incentive interventions for a range of behavioral
health-related conditions.

Within the same community, TB risks can differ by several orders of magnitude due to differences in
infectious exposure and immune competence, and TB control depends heavily on targeting services to
those most at risk. Priority groups described by the CDC and other agencies capture major TB risk
factors, but these broad categories include many individuals with low TB risk, and exclude others who
would benefit from screening. Our long-term objective is to provide individually- and locally-tailored
evidence on TB risks and intervention effects, to optimize TB prevention services. In prior work we have
demonstrated the feasibility of estimating TB risks for small population groups, and in Aim 1 we will
create granular estimates of TB risk for the US population, via a Bayesian evidence synthesis combining
time series data on TB cases and population size, prevalence of latent infection (LTBI), and the fraction
of cases due to recent infection. This analysis will allow us to produce individually-tailored risk predictions
to better target preventive services, and provide patients with quantitative information on the risks they
face. The number of patients to whom this applies is substantial—approximately half of all US residents
have been tested for LTBI, and of those testing positive only half initiate treatment. This represents a
large number of people facing decisions about LTBI testing and treatment. Aim 2 will directly address
these questions, creating highly-disaggregated estimates of the costs, harms, and benefits of LTBI
testing and treatment. To do so we will construct a Markov microsimulation model of LTBI screening and
treatment. Using this model we will estimate long-term patient-level outcomes, including changes in TB
risk, survival, costs, and adverse events. Based on these analyses we will develop a user-friendly web
tool to provide patients and clinicians prompt, validated, and individually-tailored information on possible
treatment outcomes. We will also conduct analyses and develop a companion tool that will report the
impact and cost-effectiveness of LTBI screening for user-defined target groups for the purpose of guiding
program decision-making. To increase the reach and impact of these tools we will adapt them for other
countries with TB incidence below 20 per 100,000. In Aim 3 we will develop a transmission-dynamic
simulation model to predict long-term outcomes for a broad set of TB control options (including but not
limited to LTBI treatment) and risk factor trends. The model will be calibrated for multiple jurisdictions,
and a web-based interface will allow users to specify scenarios and visualize outcomes. By identifying
how current and novel interventions can be most effectively deployed to improve health, this research
addresses the NIH’s highest priority area of health economics research, and responds directly to the
need for computational tools and models to better understand and respond to infectious disease risks.

 Dementias During and After the COVID-19 Pandemic
PROJECT SUMMARY
 The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has devastated nursing home residents in
the US, nearly half of whom are diagnosed with Alzheimer's and other related dementias (ADRD). To limit
resident exposure and expand safe access to desperately-needed care from physicians and advanced practice
providers, Medicare dropped previously tight restrictions and temporarily allowed SNFs to broadly use
telemedicine to obtain care for residents. Dropping these restrictions helped facilitate a rapid adoption of
telemedicine in SNFs, from <1% of SNFs billing for any telemedicine services in Oct-Dec 2019 to 55% in Apr-
May 2020.
 Telemedicine has long been regarded as a promising, but underused, delivery innovation for SNFs
addressing two major gaps in care. First, SNF clinicians are not always onsite, so medical issues that present
during off-hours are often addressed by transferring patients, often unnecessarily, to the emergency
department. Second, due to both financial and logistic reasons it is very difficult for SNF residents to obtain
specialty care, including specialties critical those with ADRD like neurology or psychiatry. A limited literature
suggests that telemedicine can bridge both of these care gaps, but more rigorous evidence is needed.
 In 2021, understanding the adoption and clinical impact of SNF telemedicine for the vulnerable
population of older adults with ADRD has new urgency. We propose to use Medicare claims, the Minimum
Data Set and a national survey on SNF telemedicine implementation to answer the following specific aims:
1) Evaluate the patient-level association of SNF adoption of telemedicine in 2020 with health care use and
 clinical outcomes (COVID-19 and non-COVID-19) for SNF residents with and without ADRD.
2) Use group-based trajectory models to characterize 2020-2021 SNF-level patterns of telemedicine use (e.g.,
 sustaining vs. de-adopting) and SNF characteristics associated with different trajectories.
3) Survey a national sample of SNFs, stratified by their trajectories measured in Aim 2, to assess facility
 leadership perceptions of telemedicine use and telemedicine implementation strategies.
 Understanding how SNFs have used telemedicine and its association with clinical outcomes is
essential to inform how Medicare and state Medicaid programs should regulate and promote telemedicine use
in SNFs. Our findings will also help guide clinicians who care for SNF residents with ADRD on the clinical
impact associated with telemedicine use and how it is being used nationally.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the sixth leading cause of death in the United States, where currently 5.8 million
people are living with AD dementias, and this number is projected to almost triple to 13.8 million by 2050. In
addition AD and related dementias (AD/ADRD) healthcare costs for people ≥65 years were an estimated $277
billion in 2018. Although putative risk and protective factors have been identified, published studies have been
unable to identify how to prevent and mitigate disease progression and who is most vulnerable mostly because
the existing studies are based on small sample size and lack statistical power to disentangle the effects of
different factors. Exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) (a ubiquitous yet modifiable exposure dangerous to
the aging brain) has been associated with decreased cognitive function, faster cognitive decline, dementia, AD,
and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Toxicological and human studies provide evidence of an association
between air pollution and neurodegeneration, highlighting potential biological pathways that include systemic
inflammation and oxidative stress. In response to PAR-17-054, our goal is to leverage massive nationwide
datasets (Medicare and Medicaid), coupled with advanced statistical methods, to overcome the limitations of
existing studies and clarify risk and protective factors for AD/ADRD. Specifically, in Aim 1 we will conduct
national epidemiological studies using Medicare and Medicaid claims for the period 2000-2021 for the continental
US, to estimate the association between exposure to air pollution and the time to the first AD/ADRD
hospitalization. Among enrollees that have been hospitalized for AD/ADRD or MCI we will assess whether air
pollution exposure increases risk of mortality, and/or accelerates re-hospitalization for AD/ADRD. In Aim 2 we
will apply machine learning methods to identify co-occurrence of individual-level (previous hospitalizations, race,
age, and sex), environmental (weather, green space, and noise), and SES risk (or protective) factors to
determine which population subgroups are most/least at risk for AD/ADRD hospitalization and progression
following air pollution exposure. In Aim 3 we will develop methods to overcome statistical challenges including
(1) disentangle the effects of air pollution exposure from other confounding factors by leveraging approaches for
causal inference, and (2) correct for potential outcome misclassification. We will conduct side-by-side
epidemiological analyses using traditional methods (e.g. regression) and causal inference and machine learning
approaches to understand which statistical challenges require more sophisticated approaches. To ensure
transparency and reproducibility, we will provide peer-reviewed open-source software so other investigators may
implement our methods. In summary the results of this proposal will characterize the link between air pollution
exposure and AD/ADRD hospitalization and progression, will identify the multiple modifiable risk and protective
factors that determine vulnerability in AD/ADRD, and provide the foundation for implementable actions to prevent
and reduce this enormous health burden.

Health concerns of aging—especially cognitive decline and memory loss in older age—have huge public health
implications as the United States and world populations are shifting in distribution toward older ages. While a
variety of toxicants contribute to cognitive aging, we are focused on heavy metals (Pb, As, Mn, Cd, Cr, and Se)
and metal mixtures because, despite years of regulation, clean-up, and remediation efforts, metal
contamination in many Superfund sites persists and continues to threaten public health. To our knowledge,
there is no current Superfund Research Center (SRC) that specifically addresses the health effects, risk, and
remediation of metal contaminants in relation to their effects on cognitive health in older age. To fill this critical
gap and to address the pressing public health problems posed by environmental metal contaminants on
cognitive aging, we propose a new SRC entitled Metals and Metal Mixtures: Cognitive Aging, Remediation and
Exposure Sources (MEMCARE). The overall goal of MEMCARE-SRC is to understand and mitigate effects of
exposure to metals and metal mixtures on late-life cognitive health. To achieve this goal, we have designed a
highly integrated, solution-based program of 4 Research Projects and 4 Cores. Project 1 uses an innovative
approach to assess early-life exposures and late-life cognitive function in a unique population of adults now in
their 60s and 70s who donated baby teeth as children. Project 2 investigates basic biological mechanisms
underlying effects of early-life exposures using both in vitro and in vivo approaches. Project 3 examines the
role of surface and groundwater treatment systems in spatial and temporal patterns of metals in water across
the US, including Superfund sites. Project 4 will develop novel nanostructured adsorbents to remove metals
from water, potentially providing improved remedies for our populations in Project 1 and the Community
Engagement Core (CEC). Our CEC will partner with an urban, industrially-contaminated community in Boston,
MA, and a rural community directly affected by two Superfund sites in Colorado. The Data Management and
Analysis Core (DMAC) will provide data management, biostatistical, and bioinformatics support and ensure
resource sharing and reproducible science for all Projects and Cores. The Administrative Core will provide
oversight and communicate our science to stakeholders. The Research Experience and Training Coordination
Core (RETCC) will embed with all aspects of our Center to provide doctoral and postdoctoral trainees with
relevant experiences in all aspects of work in the SRC.

Adolescent use of electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS, or e-cigarettes) has increased rapidly and can
lead to nicotine addiction and adversely affect brain development. Conversely, ENDS products can help adults
quit smoking, decreasing their cancer risk. This creates a major tradeoff in risks and benefits that must be
considered when evaluating ENDS control policies, in addition to other aspects such as costs and political
feasibility. State public health administrators are at the forefront of ENDS control policy efforts. Public health
research could guide their decision making, but research evidence is often inaccessible to decision makers or
not synthesized concisely and meaningfully. Without strategies to disseminate evidence in an accessible way it
is of limited public health impact. Existing dissemination strategies have been largely untested and have not
accounted for the inherent complexity of policy decisions (e.g., tradeoffs). The goal of this proposal is to
develop and evaluate a potential dissemination strategy: a decision support tool. Such tools can help manage
decision complexity by systematically presenting information on relevant attributes of specific policies that are
important to administrators (e.g., reach of policy, potential harms and benefits, costs to implement), and
improve research accessibility by synthesizing evidence for each attribute. In the K99 phase of the award, Dr.
Smith, a postdoctoral fellow at the Harvard Chan School, will quantify the relative importance of key attributes
of policies that administrators consider in their decision making using a discrete choice experiment. In the R00
phase, she will build a decision support tool for administrators using principles of multi-criteria decision
analysis, peer-reviewed research evidence, and quantitative results from the K99 phase. She will then conduct
a pilot study with administrators to evaluate the potential for the decision support tool to improve research
dissemination by assessing the tool’s acceptability, appropriateness, and feasibility, three key preconditions for
success. This research will provide much-needed evidence on the use of decision support tools to advance
evidence-informed policymaking. Further, this award will enable Dr. Smith to achieve her long-term career goal
of becoming an independent investigator focused on evidence-informed public health policies for cancer
prevention. Dr. Smith has a strong foundation in simulation modeling and economic evaluation; this award will
build on this foundation by providing advanced training in decision science methods and develop her expertise
in tobacco control policy. Her K99 training plan draws on the unique strengths of her transdisciplinary
mentorship team and educational and professional resources available through the Harvard T.H. Chan School
of Public Health. Overall, the research and training activities in this proposal will provide Dr. Smith with the
experience necessary to launch her career as an independent scientist working at the intersection of decision
science, policy implementation and dissemination science, and cancer prevention and control policies.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
Cancer treatments have evolved extensively over the past few decades, leading to vast improvements in
overall survival and cure rates. However, the collateral damage inflicted upon healthy tissues by both targeted
and cytotoxic agents frequently causes life-threatening irreversible toxicities. Some of the most common
toxicities include therapy-induced vascular impairments such as atherosclerosis, heart failure, ischemia, acute
thrombosis, and venous thromboembolism. Despite their widespread use, it is poorly understood how
chemotherapies and ionizing radiation cause vascular toxicities. Most cancer therapies typically induce
apoptosis (programmed cell death) by damaging common cellular components such as DNA or by blocking
critical signaling pathways. Since vascular cells are also exposed to these agents at high concentrations, they
could be vulnerable to therapy-induced apoptosis. However, the vasculature is comprised of several cell types
including vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells; it is unknown which cells are sensitive to anti-cancer
agents and how they may contribute to long-term vascular dysfunction in patients. Using human induced
pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) for in vitro disease modeling, we will investigate vascular toxicities in hiPSC-
derived vascular endothelial cells and vascular smooth muscle cells. Utilizing robust differentiation protocols
already established in our laboratory, we will rigorously test how the survival and function of these cells are
affected by cancer treatments. We will also characterize the regulation of apoptosis in both vascular cell types
by measuring apoptotic priming and expression of BCL-2 family proteins. Additionally, we will look at the
functional and morphological changes that these cells undergo in response to cancer treatments that may
contribute to vascular toxicities. We hypothesize that each vascular cell type possesses differential levels of
apoptotic priming, and unique vulnerabilities to our panel of FDA-approved cancer therapies that drive therapy-
induced vascular toxicities. Our studies will elucidate potential mechanisms and determine contributions of
each cell type to vascular toxicities observed in cancer patients. Further, since aging is known to play a role in
both vascular toxicity and regulation of apoptosis, we will investigate how age affects apoptotic priming and
therapy sensitivity of vascular cells. We will replicate key experiments in mice at various life stages (neonate,
juvenile, adult and advanced age) to validate our in vitro findings and elucidate how age affects the
development of vascular toxicities. We will also utilize endothelial cell-specific BAX/BAK double knockout mice
to determine the extent to which apoptosis blockade can ameliorate vascular toxicity induced by cancer
treatment. Altogether, our work will test how apoptosis regulation affects the sensitivity of vascular cells to
chemotherapy and radiation and how this is altered by aging. These results will lay the groundwork for
improved therapy regimens in the clinic that may decrease long-term vascular toxicities in cancer patients.

By 2060, the burden of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) in the U.S. is expected to double to
13.9 million, with women being overrepresented among cases. However, many powerful aspects of women’s
lives–including exposure to gender-based violence–have received almost no attention in ADRD research.
Women’s exposure to gender-based violence, particularly intimate partner violence (IPV), is pervasive; nearly
30% of older women have experienced IPV in their lifetime.
Preliminary evidence suggests that IPV is associated with accelerated biological aging and decreased
cognitive functioning, but samples are often highly selected, sample sizes are limited, and studies lack
longitudinal assessments. Stress sensitization models also suggest that the impact of trauma, such as IPV,
may be larger in some subgroups, since trauma and stress in early life are hypothesized to increase sensitivity
to stressful and/or traumatic experiences in later life, but such models have not been extended to neurologic
aging outcomes such as cognitive decline. However, data sources that contain robust measures on IPV and
longitudinal cognition are limited and often not population representative, limiting the external validity of study
results. Modern transportability methods from causal inference may provide novel opportunities to extrapolate
study results across populations, improving external validity at the population level.
The overall goal of this proposal is to investigate a long-term, aging-related health consequence of IPV among
cis-gender women–cognitive decline–an early indicator of ADRD risk using data from longitudinal subcohorts
of the Nurses’ Health Study II (NHS2) and the Health and Retirement Study (HRS). This work will be achieved
through three specific aims: to estimate (aim 1) the effect of experiences of IPV on trajectories of cognitive
functioning in midlife, to evaluate (aim 2) whether experiences of childhood trauma modify the effect of
experiences of IPV on trajectories of cognitive functioning in midlife, and to address (aim 3) the non-
representative nature of the NHS2 cohort by utilizing novel transportability methods developed in causal
inference to estimate the population effect of experiences of IPV on trajectories of cognitive functioning in
midlife using HRS. This work will address critical public health questions on the lifecourse consequences of
IPV among cis-gender women, bringing analysis of lifecourse and gender into ADRD research, and will provide
methodologic contributions to ADRD research to address sample limitations frequent in this field.
Further, this fellowship will provide individualized training in gender-based violence, social relationships and
networks, cognitive functioning, and methods for causal transportability alongside direct mentorship from an
exceptional team of researchers. This work is poised to contribute both substantively and methodologically to
the literature on ADRD and may help reveal how lifecourse social experiences of women influence ADRD risk.

Ethiopia has high rates of child morbidity and mortality caused by infectious diseases and malnutrition. Despite
substantial progress over the past decade, large gaps in the control and prevention of pediatric infectious diseases
and nutrition remain. Advanced research and training is needed to provide scientific evidence on the causes of
morbidity and mortality and the most effective solutions; however, this research capacity is lacking in Ethiopia.
This training program aims to train a critical mass of public health researchers to (a) work as principal
investigators leading independent research programs focused on questions of pediatric infectious diseases and
(b) teach infectious disease and nutrition research in Ethiopia. The goal of this training program is to develop
skilled researchers in Ethiopia in the area of pediatric infectious diseases and nutrition. We propose to provide
research training to public health leaders in epidemiological methods, operations and health services,
substantive topic areas, and professional skills, with a focus on childhood diarrheal diseases and acute
respiratory infections. The program will be structured to provide an appropriate balance of short, medium, and
long-term training opportunities in Boston and Ethiopia for participants from Addis Continental Institute of
Public Health and the two collaborating institutions in Ethiopia: Addis Ababa University and Haramaya
University. The principle training strategies are: 18-month postdoctoral fellowships, short-term doctoral
training, intensive short courses, and research symposia. In total, the program will train 8 postdoctoral fellows,
10 short-term doctoral fellows, and provide short course instruction to approximately 300 researchers and
professionals, of whom we anticipate at least 50 to complete a series of four courses to obtain a proposed graduate
certificate in global infectious diseases. Additionally, hundreds will be reached through annual symposia.
Trainees will benefit from exposure to ongoing epidemiological studies, clinical trials, and operations research
programs at participating institutions in Ethiopia. These activities will provide unique training opportunities for
study design and implementation, data analysis and career advancement. Research funds will be awarded to
returning postdoctoral trainees to facilitate integration into the research setting in Ethiopia. Deliverables include
manuscript and research proposal development. Research findings will be disseminated to health care providers,
policy makers, students and faculty at academic institutions, and the broader scientific community via an annual
symposium in Addis Ababa. Harvard and ACIPH faculty with extensive experience in pediatric infectious disease
and nutrition research will mentor trainees throughout the program. A senior-level Training Advisory
Committee will evaluate ongoing research progress and will be charged with program oversight. The training
program will develop a cadre of skilled public health professionals and facilitate sustainable capacity in pediatric
infectious disease and nutrition research in Ethiopia.

Increasing evidence suggests that early life and reproductive events, including specific pregnancy
complications, predict future health risks including cardiovascular (CVD) risk factors (e.g., dyslipidemia,
hypertension, obesity), clinical CVD events, and obstructive lung disease. Similarly, increasing evidence
suggests that exposures during pregnancy may affect offspring’s cardiovascular and lung health throughout
life. In this application, we propose to strengthen the infrastructure necessary to collect data on traditional and
emerging risk factors for heart and lung diseases and to document the occurrence of these conditions within
three related cohorts: the Nurses’ Health Study II (NHS-II), the Nurses’ Health Study 3 (NHS3), and the
Growing Up Today Study (GUTS). These cohorts collectively follow 188,698 individuals including more than
14,000 minority participants with large numbers of African Americans and Hispanic Americans. The cohorts
also follow more than 65,000 mother-adult offspring pairs, over 13,000 grandmother-mother-adult child triads
and over 16,000 sib-groups; resources that facilitate research aimed at identifying inter-generational risk
factors for CVD and obstructive lung diseases. Women in the two younger cohorts (NHS3 and GUTS) are in
the middle of the reproductive years, resulting in the accrual of approximately 1,000 new pregnancies per year.
Furthermore, study participants are broadly distributed across the United States, giving us the ability to
address questions regarding rural populations including areas considered to be Frontier. The proposed
infrastructure activities in these three related cohorts will ultimately support research aimed at identifying
intergenerational and early life risk factors for CVD (CHD, stroke) and obstructive lung disease (COPD and
asthma), as well as of relevant biologic intermediate endpoints, from genes to geography. We will focus our
efforts in four areas: 1) the maximization of existing resources – including updating and maintenance of food
composition databases and geographically-linked exposure data based on geographical information systems
(GIS), 2) the collection of biological specimens tied to an in-person collection of blood pressure and
anthropometric data, 3) the expansion of web-based mobile technology and “Big Data” capabilities for the
cohorts, and 4) strengthening our capability for data sharing. The ability to combine biomarker data, state-of-
the-art mobile high-resolution measures, and traditional epidemiologic risk factor data, collected across
generations and throughout the life-course in three related cohorts will enable us and others to conduct
powerful etiologic and translational research. Our goal is to maintain the quality of follow-up and associated
data, as well as to broaden the technologies that would provide innovative dimensions to the cohort for novel
scientific discovery.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：The Global Burden of Disease estimates that ambient air pollution is responsible for over 4 million deaths per
year, yet regulators in the US, EU, India, and China have been reluctant to tighten standards, which can be
costly. Those costs and the observational nature of the epidemiology studies suggesting a tightening of
existing standards would be protective of the public’s health is a major reason for this reluctance. To date,
separate standards have not been set for particle components, and health impact assessments rarely
examine environmental equity because of the paucity of subgroup-specific concentration-response functions.
Further, studies on the effects of temperature on mortality and morbidity have focused on risk associated with
short-term exposure, and not longer-term effects which may be larger. We propose to address these gaps by
using national data (US Medicare and Medicaid data, and all age Death Certificate data from multiple states
geocoded to a census block group) on mortality and hospital admissions; to use causal modeling techniques
robust to omitted confounders by design; to extend methods for environmental mixtures to large data settings
and use them to assess nonlinear and interactive effects of exposures; to use state of the art models
estimating daily air pollution and temperature exposure for the contiguous US on a 1km grid for 18 years; to
use state of the art methods to estimate exposure error in the contiguous US, to use restriction and spline
methods to address low dose effects, and to develop and use state of the art measurement error correction
methods to account for exposure error when estimating these risks.
Specifically, we will use quasi-experimental designs (difference in differences and self-controlled) that control
for many unmeasured confounders, either by stratifying on subject (controlling for individual level fixed or
slowly varying covariates) or by stratifying on neighborhood (controlling for fixed and slowly varying
neighborhood level covariates), while continuing to control for measured covariates. For acute effects of
exposures, we will use instrumental variables to adjust for unmeasured confounding. We will access large,
ready-to-use datasets we have compiled, including national Medicare and Medicaid mortality and admissions,
and state-level geocoded death certificate data. We will use highly accurate national models we have
developed for daily pollution on a 1km grid, and increase resolution to 500 m. We will use a new mixture
model, fast Bayesian Kernel Machine Regression (BKMR), to address pollution and temperature mixtures,
identify interactions and nonlinearities, and identify which exposures are most important (including which
particle components) for a given health endpoint. We will use state of the art measurement error correction
approaches (SIMEX) to identify biases in the concentration-response relationship due to exposure error. We
will supplement the BKMR approach with analyses restricted to observations below current standards, and
spline methods with propensity scores to determine whether causal effects continue below current standards.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Parent R01 Research Summary: Pregnancy is a state of constant growth, proliferation, and modification in the
immune system between mother and fetus. For this reason, the maternal immune system is at higher risk for
exposures of toxicants during pregnancy. More specifically, toxicants from ambient air pollution are numerous
and many are absorbed directly from the lungs into the blood stream, resulting in concentrations of toxicants
increasing in pregnancy vs. no pregnancy. We hypothesize that exposure to ambient air pollution, specifically
particulate matter less than 2.5 M (PM2.5), could increase the likelihood of immune dysregulation in pregnant
women during, and in the short- and long-term periods after pregnancy. We will test this by the use of an extant
set of samples already collected and stored from a prior NIEHS funded study (PO1). These stored samples are
from cohorts (pregnant vs. non-pregnant) living in Fresno, CA continuously for more than 10 years in which
individual estimate exposures of PM2.5 (and other pollutants) have been quantitated using validated and
published methods. We have stored 200 blood samples during the 2nd trimester of pregnancy, and longitudinal
samples from the mothers (at birth, at 1 yr post birth, and at 3 yrs post birth). We also have stored samples from
an age matched set non-pregnant, non-parous females from the same area (n=200). Of the n=400 individuals,
approximately 50% live in high vs. 50% live in low PM2.5 exposure areas. Leveraging this unique dataset, we
hypothesize that the immune system (after a single pregnancy) —with a specific focus on regulatory T cells or
Treg--- will be significantly dysregulated in cell subsets, gene expression, T cell receptor, and cytokine responses
in pregnancy vs. no pregnancy and that the extent of this dysregulation will be worsened by exposure to PM2.5.
In addition, we will test if these mechanistic differences are driven by underlying epigenetic changes. Moreover,
the experimental design, which is longitudinal and covers year-to-year time points will be used to test exploratory
hypotheses surrounding sustainability of these changes since we have collected short term vs. long term time
points after pregnancy. Supplement Research Summary: The extent of PM2.5-induced gene expression changes
in B-cells and Monocytes during pregnancy vs. no pregnancy is unknown. Therefore, we will conduct global gene
expression profiling of monocytes and B-cell subsets and perform the comparative transcriptome analysis on
sorted monocytes and B-cells from maternal blood vs. cord blood exposed to high vs. low PM2.5 levels (Subaim
1b). Our primary hypothesis is that during pregnancy high exposure to fine particulate matter PM2.5 modulates
the epigenetic mark on maternal immune system, by inducing cell type specific epigenetic modifications. To
determine the mechanism of PM2.5 mediated changes in pregnancy, we will perform integrative multi-omics
analysis and reconstruct the regulatory map of B-cells and monocytes. We will perform integrative analysis of
single cell methylome, single cell histone modifications, single cell RNAseq and Luminex datasets to reveal novel
regulatory (or causal) relationships associated with PM2.5 exposure.

PAR-22-172 Mental Health Research Dissertation Grant to Enhance Workforce Diversity (R36): Transgender
and/or nonbinary (TNB) college students (those whose gender is incongruent with their sex assigned at birth)
are at substantially higher risk for mental health concerns (e.g. suicidality, depression) than their cisgender
peers (whose gender aligns with sex assigned at birth). Students of color and students of lower socioeconomic
status (SES) similarly experience disparities in mental health outcomes. However, no quantitative studies of
TNB college students have examined mental health outcomes across intersecting social positions of gender
identity, race/ethnicity, and SES, a notable gap in mental health equity research. Additionally, while a growing
body of literature connects state-level protective policies with improved TNB mental health, little research has
examined the role of TNB-supportive campus policies (e.g. insurance coverage for gender affirming
healthcare, TNB-competent counseling training) in TNB student mental health. Further, no studies have
investigated the impact of these policies collectively. In light of an increasingly anti-TNB sociopolitical climate in
the US and the aforementioned scientific gaps, further research on protective policy environments for TNB
students across intersecting social positions is urgently needed. To address these gaps, this project will draw
on Intersectionality, Minority Stress, and Ecosocial frameworks. Leveraging data from the largest national
study of US college mental health, the Healthy Minds Study, including new data on TNB-supportive campus
policies from 323 campuses, this project's objective is to use rigorous social epidemiologic methods to
examine the role of TNB-supportive campus policy environments in intersectional TNB mental health
disparities. The project's aims are to: 1) estimate mental health outcomes (depression and suicidality) across
intersectional groups defined by gender, race/ethnicity, and SES; 2) empirically categorize campuses into
distinct classes of TNB-supportive policy environments; 3) characterize the degree to which policy
environments impact TNB mental health outcomes across intersectional groups of race/ethnicity and SES.
These aims are consistent with priorities stated in the NIMH Strategic Plan (Goal 4 Objective 4.3) and the NIH
FY 2021–25 Strategic Plan to Advance Research on the Health & Well-Being of Sexual & Gender Minorities.
The project is innovative in its novel application of quantitative intersectional methods to advance health equity
in TNB mental health research. The proposed project is significant in that it will generate a nuanced
understanding of the role of TNB-supportive campus policy environments in college student mental health
across intersecting social positions, with the goal of informing campus policy interventions to improve TNB
mental health. Support for this project would lay the groundwork for future studies in the investigator's career
as a scientist researching equitable policy solutions for TNB mental health.

Mucosal viruses encounter resident bacteria before they encounter and activate the immune
response and these interactions can affect viral infection and replication. These virus-bacterial
interactions heavily influence viral infections in the intestinal tract but are understudied in the
vaginal mucosa. Studies have shown that vaginal lactobacilli can interact with herpes simplex
virus however the bacterial components involved in this interaction remain unknown. Our
preliminary data show that vaginal lactobacilli interact with herpes simplex virus and inhibit
infectivity to a much greater extent than gut lactobacilli. Additionally, this interaction is
independent of lactic acid as dead bacteria are equivalently inhibitory. Further, we were able to
mimic this interaction using peptidoglycan from non-vaginal gram-positive bacteria.
In this proposal, we aim to explore the role of purified peptidoglycan from vaginal lactobacilli
strains and compare their efficacy against gut lactobacilli (Aim 1). We will explore the role of
peptidoglycan-sensing innate immune receptors in this viral suppression (Aim 2). We will define
the relevance of these observations to human health by quantifying vaginal peptidoglycan in
vaginal samples from people with lactobacilli-dominant microbiomes and bacterial vaginosis
patients who have lost their vaginal lactobacilli and have been clinically shown to have
increased shedding of herpes simplex virus. These experiments aim to propose a mechanistic
basis for clinical observations linking abundance of vaginal lactobacilli to reduced viral infection
and replication.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Project Summary
Malaria transmission occurs through the bite of Plasmodium-infected mosquitoes of the genus Anopheles, and
in much of sub-Saharan Africa, transmission of the deadliest Plasmodium falciparum parasites is mediated by
the sibling mosquito species Anopheles gambiae and An. coluzzii. The best method available to prevent malaria
infection is through long-lasting insecticide impregnated mosquito bed nets (LLINs). Distribution of LLINs has
had a massive impact on the number of malaria cases, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, with epidemiological
modelling predicting that between 2000 and 2015 LLINs were responsible for as much as 68% of the observed
reduction in malaria cases in this period (1). As such, insecticide-based mosquito control represents the
cornerstone of malaria prevention and elimination efforts. Inevitably, however, mass distribution of LLINs has
driven widespread resistance to pyrethroid insecticides in Anopheles populations. This issue stresses the need
for new tools to prevent malaria transmission. We recently demonstrated that antimalarials applied to solid
surfaces can kill the mosquito stages of P. falciparum parasites when Anopheles females absorb these
compounds via their legs. From a preliminary in vivo efficacy screen, we have identified two structurally similar
endoquine-like quinolone (ELQ) compounds that very efficiently target different sites (Qo and Qi, which
importantly do not induce cross-resistance) on the P. falciparum cytochrome bc1 complex. These compounds,
ELQ-453 (Qo) and ELQ-613 (Qi), exhibit outstanding performance in our in vivo tarsal contact transmission
blocking assay. Here we propose to build on the structural backbone of these compounds and use an iterative
medicinal chemistry approach to optimize both potency against mosquito stages of parasite development and
efficiency of tarsal uptake. Furthermore, we will determine the activity of compounds after impregnation in bed
net-like polymer fiber textiles that will allow testing for durability, photostability, wash-resistance and other
parameters essential for the development of an antimalarial-coated bed net product destined for use in malaria-
endemic areas. Specifically, we will: Aim 1) Design ELQ compounds with increased anti-parasitic potency by
varying their constituent 3-alkyl side chain and benzenoid substituents. We will also investigate the propensity
of the best-performing compounds to select resistant parasite mutants, and will test transmissibility of these
mutants to mosquitoes; Aim 2) Maximize tarsal availability and mosquito pharmacokinetics of these novel ELQ
compounds by optimizing the design of their prodrug moiety; Aim 3) Develop and validate novel ELQ-
impregnated textiles as a prototype for future bed net products incorporating both insecticide and antimalarial
ingredients. To achieve these goals, we will collaborate with leaders in the fields of ELQ medicinal chemistry
(Mike Riscoe OHSU), and product development and testing (Mike Rubal, SwRI). At the end of this project, we
will have generated and validated an innovative mosquito-targeting control tool to reduce malaria transmission
and limit the impact of insecticide resistance.

Even the largest lung cancer screening trial to date, the National Lung Cancer Screening Trial (NLST) is
insufficient on its own to answer questions about the effectiveness of lung cancer screening in diverse clinical
settings. Findings from the NLST may not generalize to new populations due to the highly selected trial
population, higher levels of adherence, and screening strategies that do not reflect current practice. Claims
datasets, screening registries, and prospective studies offer opportunities for evaluating lung cancer screening
strategies in real-world populations, but current methods that attempt to integrate this evidence are insufficient.
Standard meta-analyses and simulation models use information from multiple trials and studies, but produce
estimates that do not have a clear causal interpretation for any target population. The proposed project will
bridge the gap between the available data and policy relevant questions by combining diverse information and
developing new methods to estimate screening strategies that have a causal interpretation in nationally
representative target populations. Our long-term objective is to reduce lung cancer mortality by combining
multi-source data to learn about optimal lung cancer screening strategies in real-world populations. We will
take steps toward this objective by achieving the following specific aims: (1) Use information from diverse
sources to transport the effect of lung cancer screening strategies from trials to nationally representative target
populations; (2) Identify individuals in nationally representative target populations who are most likely to benefit
from lung cancer screening, including individuals traditionally underrepresented in trials, by jointly evaluating
effect heterogeneity over multiple characteristics; (3) Model adherence patterns to lung cancer screening
strategies in real-world settings and use these models to assess the effects of lung cancer screening strategies
under different levels of adherence in nationally representative target populations; (4) Estimate in nationally
representative target populations the comparative effectiveness of lung cancer screening strategies when the
strategies have not been directly compared in the same trial but have been evaluated in different trials against
a common comparator; (5) Use information from diverse sources as inputs in a simulation model to compare
screening strategies that differ from those used in trials, in nationally representative target populations. This
project will provide new insights on the comparative effectiveness of lung cancer screening strategies. Training
in cancer prevention and statistical skills will launch my career as an independent researcher in data science
and epidemiology that develops causal, statistical, and simulation methods to produce evidence that will lead
to improved decision-making for cancer control strategies.

Infecting an estimated one quarter of the world’s population, M. tuberculosis (Mtb) is an ongoing threat to human
health worldwide. Mtb infection can lead to a wide range of outcomes ranging from an asymptomatic latent
infection to severe disease. These disease states are the function of bacterial, host, and environmental factors.
Despite ongoing selection to adapt to the host environment, the contribution of Mtb’s genetic variation is an
underappreciated variable in this equation.
Evolution acts on regulation of gene expression to create large phenotypic diversity from small genetic change.
Our long-term objective is to understand how evolution in Mtb’s regulatory network contributes to variation in
disease outcome. In a preliminary study, we used a high-throughput transcriptomic pipeline we built to capture
transcriptomes from 284 clinical isolates from Vietnam and Peru; we identified ~10% of well-transcribed genes
were highly variable across isolates and linked expression outliers to mutations in transcriptional regulators or
nearby regulatory regions. Unexpectedly, we identified an up to 17-fold range in expression of ESX-1 secreted
effector proteins; a key virulence pathway, ESX-1 is required for productive infection. Based on these results,
we propose two aims for this study. In Aim 1, since transcriptional regulation responds to the environment, we
will capture transcriptomes from our isolate library during in vitro acid stress and hypoxia, environments from
establishment of infection and survival in granuloma, respectively. By searching for convergent evolution in gene
expression across the phylogenetic tree, we will identify expression programs and genetic variants that drive
adaptive change in host. In Aim 2, we will build on our discovery of ESX-1’s expression variation and integrate
natural variants driving four distinct expression states across two secreted effector operons. Next, we will use
these engineered strains in a macrophage and mouse model of infection to determine if and how they drive
different disease phenotypes.
Mtb is under constant selective pressure to survive the host environment. This work uses Mtb’s natural variation
to illuminate the genetic pathways and molecular strategies that evolution bends to this goal. This work will
explore the mechanisms of Mtb genetic variation that contribute to variable disease outcomes. It is critical that
we expand our understanding of pathogens beyond a few strains: if we limit ourselves to laboratory strains, we
risk designing treatments that will not work outside the laboratory.

Concurrent increase in life expectancy and the prevalence of age-related metabolic diseases
highlights how the biology of aging and metabolic dysfunction are intertwined. Dietary restriction
(DR) promotes healthy aging and disease resistance through the manipulation of canonical
nutrient sensing pathways, like TORC1 (target of rapamycin complex I) signaling. However,
manipulation of such critical metabolic pathways results in pleiotropic effects, making it critical to
understand their distinct downstream mechanisms. Previous studies in C. elegans suggest a
critical role for the spliceosome component REPO-1 (reverse polarity 1) in modulating lipid
accumulation and longevity downstream of DR and TORC1 specifically. Knockdown of REPO-1
causes an increase in lipid accumulation in genetic models of DR and reduced TORC1 signaling.
We have identified specific lipid species such as the C18:1 fatty acid as targets of REPO-1
modulation. Additionally, REPO-1 binds pod-2 (polarity and osmotic sensitivity defect 1) Pre-
mRNA and pod-2 is similarly and specifically required for DR and TORC1 lifespan extension.
Further, knockdown of pod-2 phenotypically mimics knockdown of repo-1 causing increased lipid
accumulation. However, it remains to be determined whether this constitutes a causal pathway.
Therefore, the overarching aim of this proposal is to uncover the contribution of pre-mRNA
splicing and lipid metabolism in TORC1 lifespan extension. My central hypothesis is that
REPO-1 regulates TORC1 lifespan extension by modulating alternative splicing and specific lipid
species through POD-2. In aim 1, we will use Crispr/Cas9 mediated tagging of endogenous
REPO-1 to assess tissue-specific effects of REPO-1 on alternative splicing, modulation of lipid
accumulation and longevity downstream of TORC1 signaling. In aim 2, we will achieve tissue-
specific degradation of POD-2 to determine the tissue where it modulates longevity and fat
reserves in TORC1 signaling. We will also define the changes to the lipidome of TORC1 regulated
by POD-2, compare them to REPO-1 dependent changes, and test their contribution to longevity.
Altogether this work will broaden our mechanistic understanding of RNA homeostasis as a
novel paradigm of aging and physiology and expand our knowledge of target pathways to
promote healthy aging.

Antibiotic-resistant Gram-negative infections pose a serious threat to human health. The outer membrane of
Gram-negative bacteria is a unique structure essential for survival; it also functions as a physical barrier to block
entry of many classes of antibiotics, thereby rendering them ineffective. At present, colistin is the only antibiotic
active against many resistant Gram-negative infections, but it has dose-limiting toxicity. We have discovered that
the DNA gyrase inhibitor novobiocin and analogs with no gyrase activity potentiate the activity of colistin. Based
on genetic, structural, and biochemical data, we propose that they do so by binding to and activating the inner
membrane lipopolysaccharide transport complex. The inner membrane complex uses the energy of ATP
hydrolysis by a cytoplasmic ATPase (LptB) to extract lipopolysaccharide from the inner membrane and move it
onto a protein bridge that spans the periplasm to the outer membrane. We have shown that novobiocin binds at
the interface between LptB and LptFG, the transmembrane components of the transporter. We have also shown
that another component of the transporter, LptC, couples the energy of ATP hydrolysis to LPS extraction from
the membrane. We propose experiments to better understand how LptC coordinates ATP hydrolysis with LPS
extraction because this information is integral to understanding how novobiocin activates the machine. We also
propose to develop new assays to quantify binding of novobiocin analogs and to monitor machine dynamics. We
will apply these assays to characterize new synthetic analogs of novobiocin. Our objective is to identify
compounds that strongly activate the transport machine while retaining gyrase activity. We will test compounds
for synergy with colistin to test the hypothesis that strong activation of the transport machine is required for good
synergy. This work may lead to development of safer colistin-based therapies to treat Gram-negative infections.
In addition, the fundamental knowledge obtained about how this transporter works could enable discovery of
other classes of compounds that interfere with its function.

The U.S. service sector employs 27 million workers, 20% of the U.S. workforce. Abetted by new technologies,
employers in the service sector have embraced surveillance and sanctioning, which affect time and pace of tasks
on the job, unpredictable and constrained scheduling practices, which affect the organization of time on and off
work, and automation, which shapes longer-term expectations for the future and job insecurity. We refer to these
working conditions, collectively, as temporal dimensions of job quality to draw a contrast with purely economic
dimensions of job quality. Although prior research has established a robust relationship between other aspects
of job conditions and health, there is a gap in knowledge about how these new and increasingly prevalent
workplace practices affect worker health and healthy aging. One important reason for this gap is a lack of suitable
existing data containing information on both these emergent workplace practices and workers’ health outcomes,
yet policy makers have already begun to take action to regulate these practices. There is thus a critical need to
collect new data that will allow researchers to estimate the health effects of exposure to these temporal
dimensions of job quality for workers across the life course. The proposed research expands upon an innovative
method for collecting survey data at scale, at low-cost, and with speed from a target population of service-sector
workers. We use the Facebook advertising platform to purchase and place survey recruitment advertisements
in the mobile and desktop newsfeeds of Facebook and Instagram users, targeting those who work in retail and
fast food. This approach allows us to target users with particular employers and/or in specific localities. We
propose to collect repeated cross-sectional and longitudinal survey data from 90,000 workers across the country.
The proposed research uses these data and methods to accomplish three aims. First, we estimate the
relationship between emergent temporal dimensions of job quality and worker health and healthy aging. The
data collection is designed to capitalize on natural experiments to provide rigorous evidence on the health effects
of temporally precarious work. One set of analyses will exploit city and company policy changes to use rigorous
difference-in-differences and instrumental variable methods to estimate causal effects of job quality on health.
Second, we assess whether the health consequences of surveillance and sanctioning, schedule unpredictability
and constraint, and automation vary across the life course. Finally, we will assess the social and public supports
that may buffer and mitigate the harmful health effects of these temporal dimensions of job quality. In sum, we
deploy an innovative data collection approach combined with rigorous estimation to take advantage of natural
experiments implemented when labor laws or company practices change. The significant contributions of our
project entail testing how new dimensions of job quality affect health, estimating differential vulnerabilities across
the life course, and gauging the importance of protective supports and policies. Collectively, this research
provides key missing evidence on health impacts of job quality.

Parental care is essential for offspring well-being and survival yet requires a significant invest from adults
without immediate benefit, suggesting the existence of hard-wired mechanisms governing its control. Despite
the importance of this evolutionarily controlled behavior, parental behaviors vary greatly between animals of
different sex, physiological state, and genetic background. Previous studies examining sex- and state-
dependent influences on parental behavior have lacked the cell-type resolution critical to understanding how
specific circuit components are modulated. The long timescale (hours to days) of changes affecting parenting
behaviors suggests that neural circuits respond through dynamic gene expression changes. Through the use
of intersectional genetics and single cell analysis I have established exquisitely specific access to two key
neuronal hubs controlling parenting behavior. Preliminary results comparing Mothers, Fathers, and Virgin
animals suggest potential transcriptional, epigenetic, and biophysical differences that are dependent on the
animal’s sex and physiological state. During the K99 phase of the work proposed here I will rigorously assess
sex- and state-dependent transcriptional changes, as well as their biophysical and behavioral implications,
using the latest tools for cell-type specific recording and manipulation. I will uncover gene regulatory networks
that give rise to observed transcriptional changes and will develop new intersectional tools to modulate gene
expression in a cell-type specific manner. The successful completion of these Aims will reveal the molecular
mechanisms though which sex and state mediate transcriptional reprograming to affect the function of this
conserved behavioral circuit. Genetic variation also contributes to differences in the display of parental care.
Preliminary results utilizing genetically distinct mouse strains show dramatic differences in parenting behavior
and suggest a genetic contribution to behavioral variation. In the independent R00 phase of this proposal, I will
perform a forward-genetic screen utilizing a well-characterized panel of genetically diverse mice to find
genomic variants that contribute to parental behavior. The cell-type specific gene regulatory networks revealed
in the previous Aims will then be used to assess the causal role of individual variants, providing a level of
molecular explanation unobtainable with previous genetic mapping experiments. Furthermore, the successful
completion of this project will provide a platform for future experiments aimed at understanding how genetic
variants contribute to gene expression that ultimately affects animal behavior.
The training phase of the award will be conducted in the laboratory of Dr. Catherine Dulac at Harvard
University. In addition, I will be mentored by the outstanding team of scientists on my advisory committee that
will assist with specific training goals as well as career guidance. In my application I have outlined a
comprehensive plan for the acquisition of conceptual, technical, and professional skills that will enable my
transition to an independent research position.

 Advances in organic synthetic methodology can profoundly impact the development of new and useful
medicines. For example, cross-coupling reactions have become indispensable tools in medicinal chemistry,
provided entry to previously inaccessible chemical space, and enhanced drug discovery efforts. Recently,
methods for the selective functionalization of C–H bonds have gained attention from the pharmaceutical industry
due to their potential utility in the diversification of drug-like scaffolds. Toward this end, metal-catalyzed C–H
functionalization reactions that take advantage of polar functional groups to direct site-selective C–H activation
have been extensively explored. In comparison, methods that avoid the use of pre-installed directing groups, or
“undirected” C–H functionalization reactions, are underdeveloped. Specifically, the selective and undirected
metal-catalyzed activation of strong primary C(sp3)–H bonds in the presence of weaker C–H bonds represents
an ongoing challenge in the field. Notably, such technologies would provide chemists with useful synthetic tools
to install functionality at remote sites on bioactive molecules. Though methods for the undirected selective
catalytic functionalization of methyl groups to forge C–C, C–B, and C–Cl bonds have recently emerged, a general
catalytic oxidation (C–O bond formation) of unactivated primary C(sp3)–H bonds is unknown.
 Metal-stabilized carbenes, nitrenes, and oxenes are useful reactive intermediates that can insert carbon or
heteroatom functionality into strong C(sp3)–H bonds with ligand-controlled selectivities. Although early- and mid-
first-row transition-metal-oxo complexes have been intensively studied, first-row late-transition-metal-oxo
species (LTM-oxo) are less explored despite their potential utility for C–H oxidation. Indeed, synthesizing LTM-
oxo complexes represents a major challenge toward harnessing these highly reactive species as useful oxidants.
The proposed research aims to develop a modular route toward a series of LTM-oxo complexes bearing a novel
sterically-bulky triptycene-substituted dipyrrin ligand scaffold. This ligand architecture is expected to enforce
kinetic stability of the complexes to facilitate isolation and characterization efforts. The ligand scaffold will also
promote high-spin electronic configurations, which should weaken the M–O bond and render the complexes
more reactive toward C(sp3)–H oxidation. Finally, the reactivity of transiently-formed and sterically encumbered
LTM-oxo complexes will be harnessed to enable the selective and undirected catalytic oxidation of sterically
unhindered methyl groups. This methodology will also be applied toward the selective late-stage functionalization
of medicinally-relevant scaffolds. These efforts will result in the first general method for the catalytic undirected
oxidation of primary C(sp3)–H bonds. Moreover, these studies will provide the first unambiguous characterization
of high-spin LTM-oxo complexes and validate their synthetic utility for catalytic C–H oxidation.

The Arrestin superfamily of proteins controls the trafficking, turnover and signaling of trans-
membrane receptors, as well as other intracellular signaling functions. Several members of the
family, including ARRDC3 and TXNIP, are now known to have important roles in metabolism.
ARRDC4 is an understudied protein that has been shown to inhibit glucose uptake in vitro,
interact with ubiquitin ligases and plays a role in membrane receptor trafficking. The in vivo
functions and the molecular mechanisms of ARRDC4 are unknown. My preliminary experiments
reveal that mice with systemic deletion of ARRDC4 are glucagon resistant compared to wildtype
controls. Decreased hepatic gluconeogenesis and glucagon signaling and defects in hepatic
glucose production suppression were also observed in the liver tissues of ARRDC4KO mice. I
have now generated a new conditional deletion ARRDC4 mouse model for this project.
The glucagon receptor is a GPCR, and therefore a potential target to interact with arrestin family
proteins. As ARRDC4 interacts with membrane proteins and 7TM receptors, an important goal
of my research is to answer if ARRDC4 controls glucagon signaling by interacting with glucagon
receptors or its downstream mediators. The specific aims of this project will focus on unraveling
the functions of ARRDC4 in hepatic glucose metabolism in vivo and the mechanism of ARRDC4
regulation at the molecular level. Because ARRDC4 is itself regulated by glucose and insulin,
defining the metabolic functions of ARRDC4 has the potential to reveal a metabolic feedback
loop in glucose metabolism that interfaces with glucagon signaling.

Recent exome sequencing efforts have implicated alterations that occur within the actin-related proteins (Arps),
ACTL6A and ACTL6B, in both cancer and neurodevelopmental disorders. These highly conserved and tissue-
specific protein paralogues are subunits of multi-component molecular machines that use the energy derived
from ATP hydrolysis to modify chromatin architecture, and hence modulate gene expression. ACTL6A and
ACTL6B are subunits of four major chromatin regulators known to remodel the architecture of chromatin: (1) the
Tip60/NuA4 histone acetyl transferase, and the (2) INO80, (3) SRCAP, and (4) mammalian SWI/SNF
(mSWI/SNF), also called BRG1/BRM Associated Factors (BAF) ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling
complexes. The mSWI/SNF complex has been particularly implicated in a range of neurodevelopmental
disorders and in over 20% of all cancers. However, despite these intriguing genetic studies as well as data
suggesting that Arps are required for proper chromatin regulation, there is very little understanding regarding the
biochemical and genome-wide role of Arps in chromatin remodeling activities. My proposed research plan aims
to further our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of disease conferred by mutant ACTL6A and ACTL6B
by identifying functional regions and the biochemical and genome-wide activities of the Arps. Aim 1 investigates
the functional regions and biochemical activities contributed to chromatin remodeling complexes by ACTL6A and
ACTL6B in WT conditions and mutant settings linked with neurodevelopmental disorders. More specifically, Sub-
aim 1A seeks to compare the interactome of the ACTL6 subunits. Sub-aim 1B unbiasedly compares the protein
interactions of WT and mutant ACTL6A/B. Sub-aim 1C focuses on mSWI/SNF complexes to assess their histone
binding and enzymatic activities in WT forms and in those complexes bearing Arps with disease-relevant
mutations. Aim 2 dissects the genome-wide function of the Arps by comparing a WT control to induced
pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) engineered to have disease-relevant mutations. Sub-aim 2A dissects the
chromatin accessibility and gene expression profiles of WT and mutant iPSCs. And, Sub-aim 2B looks at the
genome targeting of the mutant and WT ACTL6 subunits and the four major protein complexes known to bind
them. Successful completion of these aims will provide new insights regarding the interplay of chromatin
remodeling complexes unified by the same family of Arp proteins, define the molecular mechanisms of
ACTL6A/B-binding proteins in normal and disease states, and suggest novel targeted therapeutic approaches
for cancer and intellectual disabilities. The research laboratory of Dr. Cigall Kadoch is the ideal setting to conduct
the disease-oriented research at the interface between biochemistry and functional genomics detailed in this
proposal. Training in state-of-the-art biochemical, enzymatic, and genomic assays, as well as the professional
development Dr. Kadoch provides on scientific communication, networking, leadership, and advocacy will allow
to me to become a capable independent scientist.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Multiple myeloma (MM) kills nearly 13,000 people annually in the United States1. MM is preceded by a less life-
threating blood condition, which is similar to MM, yet non-lethal and asymptomatic2. in fact, most people don’t
even know they have it. An outstanding question in MM research is why some patients diagnosed with the
precursor condition go on to develop the full disease and why others do not. This question has been approached
from a genetics standpoint, however there is no clear genetic link defining who goes on to develop MM from a
precursor condition and who does not. Bone marrow creates a microenvironment to support developing blood
cells. Multiple myeloma hijacks the bone marrow microenvironment (BMM) to favor its own growth3. Without a
genetic driver of cancer development, I hypothesize that the BMM is modified epigenetically to facilitate the
selective growth of MM.
Epigenetics encompasses that which influences the expression of genes without altering the genes themselves.
Chromatin regulators (CRs) are proteins that mediate epigenetic changes through altering the ability of a cell to
express a given gene. CRs carry out this process through modifying the histone proteins around which genes
are wrapped (histones and DNA taken together comprise chromatin, hence: chromatin regulators). In addition to
these very specific functions, CRs can also mediate interactions with transcription factors (TFs), the proteins that
turn the expression levels of genes up or down. A specific CR LSD1, which is known to repress or turn off genes,
has been the target of other blood cancer diseases and drugs designed to block LSD1 activity are quite effective
in models of acute myeloid leukemia (AML)45. These drugs work by disrupting an interaction between LSD1 and
another protein. When that interaction is disrupted, a master TF is able to turn on genes that cause AML cells to
die5. Despite some similarities between AML and MM, treatment with LSD1-targeting drugs actually enhances
the growth of MM6. Interestingly, a small subset of patients have been found to be predisposed to MM
development through a heritable set of mutations in LSD1 – these mutations mimic mutations that confer drug
resistance in AML5,6. While these mutations only make up a small fraction of MM cases, it points to LSD1 as a
key component in the development of MM7. I thereby hypothesize that LSD1 plays a role in the progression of
MM; this role is potentially specific to the BMM. The specific aims of this project can be summarized as follows:
 1. Develop a computational tool using novel techniques from machine learning and mathematics to learn
 about factors that drive the BMM to contribute to the progression of MM.
 2. Collect BMM samples from patients across a spectrum of MM development to analyze single cell gene
 expression and chromatin accessibility data to learn the ways in which the epigenome is altered as MM
 progresses in the BMM.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
In the adaptive immune response, cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) continuously “crawl” seeking evidence of foreign
peptide fragments on the surface of other cells. Once the T cell encounters a target cell with foreign or mutant
peptides, then it is activated unleashing a potent immune response. Emerging evidence suggests that cell
mechanical forces transmitted to the T cell receptor (TCR) contribute to its high specificity in antigen recognition
and promote T-cell activation. This is not surprising, as the TCR and other T cell co-receptors bind their cognate
ligands only when two dynamic cells physically “touch”. As a first step toward understanding the role of molecular
forces in tuning T cell response, it is important that we measure the magnitude of forces transmitted to ligand-
receptor complexes and then to relate mechanical events to signaling and functional responses.
 My PhD research (F99 phase) has focused on developing methods to measure and elucidate the role of
mechanical forces in immune response. I have designed a microparticle tension senor that allows one to quantify
receptor forces in high throughput and also to measure forces at curved cell junctions. Additionally, I used this
assay to screen the dose-response function of drugs that modulate cell mechanics. Because T cell responses
are fine tuned by an array of co-receptors, I tested the role of mechanics in LFA-1 function. In this work, I
demonstrated that the magnitude of LFA-1 integrin forces fine tunes TCR triggered activation and antigen
discrimination. In addition, I revealed mechanically active LFA-1 defines the permissive zones for cytotoxic
secretion, and suppression of LFA-1 forces significantly abrogates cytotoxicity.
 My work suggests that receptors cooperate to tune T-cell responses. For the remainder of my F99 phase,
I will investigate the mechano-communication between receptor forces. Specifically, I will develop a DNA origami
nano device to pattern ligands and measure spatiotemporal colocalization of mechanical events. Afterwards, I
will proceed to test this hypothesis on cell plasma membrane by engineering tension probes on the surface of
living cells. This will enable one to control and measure TCR-forces at authentic cell-cell junctions that mimic the
chemical and physical properties of the immune synapse.
 For my postdoctoral work (K00 phase), I aim to improve upon current cancer therapies by leveraging T
cell mechanics in boosting the specificity of immune response. In adoptive cell therapy (ACT), after therapeutic
T-cell reinfusion, adjuvant drugs such as cytokines need to be administered to boost immune reconstitution.
However, nonspecific drug release causes side effects and T-cell exhaustion. To address this challenge, I will
decorate T-cells with DNA cages that mechanically trigger the release of encapsuled drugs at the tumor zone. If
successful, this work will significantly enhance the ACT efficiency and offer the first example that links
mechanobiology to cancer immunotherapy.

Fibrosis is a hallmark of cancer that promotes proliferation, metastasis, and immune evasion by altering the
tumor stroma which accounts for up to 90% of tumor mass. In fibrosis, pathogenic departure from homeostasis
results in the excessive deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM) by myofibroblasts, creating discrete regions of
non-resolving wound repair. These regions of fibrotic ECM become dominant regulators of cell phenotype,
providing both biochemical (i.e. ECM composition and soluble factors) and biophysical (i.e. mechanical forces
and material properties) cues to promote tumor progression and restrict immune cell infiltration. Soluble factors
within the interstitial space of these fibrotic organs drain into surrounding lymph nodes (LNs) and induce fibrotic
remodeling in the LN, a common sign of poor prognosis in cancer and other fibrotic pathologies. LNs have a
distinct microenvironment known as the conduit system, which traffics antigens and serves as a migratory
scaffold for lymphocytes. In health, its organization facilitates interactions between T cells and antigen presenting
cells to ensure robust immune activation in response to cancer, pathogens, and injury. Fibroblastic reticular cells
(FRCs) construct and ensheath this collagenous network and produce cytokines that promote T cell survival and
homeostasis. Disruption of this ECM network leads to T cell dysregulation and depletion, implicating lymph node
fibrosis in disease progression. The mechanisms of fibrotic initiation in the LN and the effect of LN fibrosis in T
cell function is poorly understood, yet represent an attractive therapeutic opportunity. In other tissues, fibrotic
remodeling mechanically stiffens the microenvironment, initiating integrin-mediated signaling cascades. I
hypothesize that similar mechanisms drive LN fibrosis by FRCs, and seek to explore how remodeling of the LN
microenvironment affects development of T cell responses in fibrosis and cancer.
The first aim of this proposal (F99 phase) evaluates whether integrin signaling drives LN fibrosis by promoting
FRC-to-myofibroblast differentiation. This will be accomplished in part by analyzing LNs from Idiopathic
Pulmonary Fibrosis and melanoma patients with advanced mechanobiological (atomic force microscopy) and
spatial-omic imaging (CODEX) methods to measure stiffness, ECM content, and FRC/T cell phenotypes. The
knowledge and skills learned in Aim 1 are then applied in Aim 2 (K00 phase) to study the impact of fibrosis in
tumor draining LNs on anti-tumor T cell responses in murine models of melanoma.

Enhancers are an important class of noncoding loci regulating gene expression and play important roles in
modulating diverse phenotypes and disease states. However, our understanding of the role of enhancers in
phenotypic evolution is limited and we lack a detailed understanding of the relationship between sequence
change within and between species, epigenetic states and variation in enhancer function. Moreover, we have
few statistical models that allow researchers to connect evolutionary changes in enhancer sequences within
and between species to phenotypic variation, and we often cannot unambiguously determine the causes of
observed changes in evolutionary rate of enhancers along lineages. Finally, most studies of enhancer
evolution thus far have studied only small numbers of enhancers and genome-wide assays of enhancer
variation and function are rare. Here we propose to develop statistical models linking phylogenetic patterns of
enhancer evolution with phenotypic variation between species, and to leverage within-species variation across
multiple species – “comparative population genomics” – to disentangle the sources of rate changes observed
in enhancers across species. We will also functionally test diverse enhancers on a large-scale, using the
developing fore- and hindlimb of volant and flightless birds as a model of development and gene expression.
Specifically, in Aim 1 we will extend a recently developed Bayesian phylogenetic model for detecting rate
changes in noncoding DNA, phyloAcc, to improve its biological realism by incorporating stochastic gene tree
heterogeneity and the ability to associate sequence change with both binary and continuous traits. Building on
a novel data set of comparative gene expression and chromatin states across multiple species and
developmental stages, we will also develop methods to associate genome-wide variation in chromatin states
between species with binary and continuous traits. In Aim 2 we will develop additional statistical models to
leverage information from sequence variation within species to better understand the evolutionary forces
contributing to rate variation in noncoding DNA observed between species. The models developed in Aims 1
and 2 will be refined and made available to the broader community in a user-friendly format for use on diverse
systems and species. In Aim 3 we will functionally validate large numbers of candidate enhancers identified in
Aims 1 and 2 as having evolved new functions or found in altered chromatin states in the developing fore- and
hindlimb of volant and flightless birds. Using high-throughput assays in chicken, emu and other birds we will
study the relationship between within- and between-species sequence variation of enhancers and their ability
to drive gene expression. Together these aims will provide a number of tools that will benefit the community of
researchers using comparative genomics to understand links between genotype and phenotype, and will
extend the kinds of phenotypic traits and genomic signatures that will inform this emerging paradigm.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The U.S. service sector employs 27 million workers, 20% of the U.S. workforce. Abetted by new technologies,
employers in the service sector have embraced surveillance and sanctioning, which affect time and pace of tasks
on the job, unpredictable and constrained scheduling practices, which affect the organization of time on and off
work, and automation, which shapes longer-term expectations for the future and job insecurity. We refer to these
working conditions, collectively, as temporal dimensions of job quality to draw a contrast with purely economic
dimensions of job quality. Although prior research has established a robust relationship between other aspects
of job conditions and health, there is a gap in knowledge about how these new and increasingly prevalent
workplace practices affect worker health and healthy aging. One important reason for this gap is a lack of suitable
existing data containing information on both these emergent workplace practices and workers’ health outcomes,
yet policy makers have already begun to take action to regulate these practices. There is thus a critical need to
collect new data that will allow researchers to estimate the health effects of exposure to these temporal
dimensions of job quality for workers across the life course. The proposed research expands upon an innovative
method for collecting survey data at scale, at low-cost, and with speed from a target population of service-sector
workers. We use the Facebook advertising platform to purchase and place survey recruitment advertisements
in the mobile and desktop newsfeeds of Facebook and Instagram users, targeting those who work in retail and
fast food. This approach allows us to target users with particular employers and/or in specific localities. We
propose to collect repeated cross-sectional and longitudinal survey data from 90,000 workers across the country.
The proposed research uses these data and methods to accomplish three aims. First, we estimate the
relationship between emergent temporal dimensions of job quality and worker health and healthy aging. The
data collection is designed to capitalize on natural experiments to provide rigorous evidence on the health effects
of temporally precarious work. One set of analyses will exploit city and company policy changes to use rigorous
difference-in-differences and instrumental variable methods to estimate causal effects of job quality on health.
Second, we assess whether the health consequences of surveillance and sanctioning, schedule unpredictability
and constraint, and automation vary across the life course. Finally, we will assess the social and public supports
that may buffer and mitigate the harmful health effects of these temporal dimensions of job quality. In sum, we
deploy an innovative data collection approach combined with rigorous estimation to take advantage of natural
experiments implemented when labor laws or company practices change. The significant contributions of our
project entail testing how new dimensions of job quality affect health, estimating differential vulnerabilities across
the life course, and gauging the importance of protective supports and policies. Collectively, this research
provides key missing evidence on health impacts of job quality.

The vision of the Generalist Repository Ecosystem Initiative (GREI) is to develop collaborative approaches for data management and sharing through inclusion of established generalist repositories in the NIH data ecosystem and better enable search and discovery of NIH funded data in the generalist repositories. This is one of the steps in the modernization of the data resources ecosystem and aligns with the NIH Strategic Plan for Data Science.
The primary mission of the Generalist Repository Ecosystem Initiative is to establish a common set of cohesive and consistent capabilities, services, metrics, and social infrastructure across various generalist repositories. A secondary mission is to also raise general awareness and facilitate researchers to adopt FAIR principles to better share and reuse data.
The objectives of the project are to work together with the other awardee teams to develop a “co-opetition plan” that include a commitment to a solution architecture, data submission and QA/QC capabilities to support relevant use cases, train and educate users, as well as provide usage analytics and reporting to the NIH.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：The olfactory tubercle (OT) is a ventral striatal brain region implicated in reward processing and motivated
behaviors including addiction. It receives olfactory sensory input, as well as strong dopaminergic innervation
from the ventral tegmental area (VTA). Learning-induced changes in neural activity can occur rapidly and
differentially in distinct types of neurons on the OT, but it is not clear how stable these changes in
representations are. Recent studies in many brain regions have revealed a surprising instability in sensory
representations, even when the animal’s behavior is stable. Unstable representations are hypothesized to
potentially arise from ongoing synaptic plasticity, as might occur with ongoing activity or further learning.
Whether such “representational drift” is present in striatal areas including the OT is unknown and will be a
subject of inquiry in this proposal. The PIs will ask whether OT neural representation of previously learned
associations is stable when new associations are learned, and whether the representations are altered
when old associations are unlearned or degraded. The PIs will use deep brain multiphoton imaging at
subcellular resolution to monitor activity in identified subtypes of OT neurons over weeks as mice learn and
maintain odor-outcome associations. Using our collective expertise in behavior, physiology, and imaging,
the PIs will tackle the following Aims. Aim 1: To determine whether neural representations of cue-outcome
associations in the OT are stable over several days. The PIs will train mice to learn the arbitrarily assigned
valence of several odors and track the activity of two cardinal types of neurons in the OT in behaving mice
during and after task learning over multiple weeks. The PIs hypothesize that continuous experience and
reinforcement will stabilize representations in the OT, which can degrade with pauses in experience. Aim 2:
To determine whether and how existing representations in the OT change when new cue-outcome
associations are learned. After mice have stably associated several odors with specific outcomes, the PIs
will introduce new odors to be learned, reverse or extinguish familiar associations, as specific OT neural
populations are tracked. The PIs hypothesize that new learning will lead to greater representational drift for
older, familiar associations. Aim 3: To determine the role of dopaminergic signaling in maintaining stability
and flexibility of representations in the OT. Whether continued dopamine signaling in the OT helps maintain
stable representations through repetition or perturbs stability by promoting additional synaptic plasticity is
unknown. The PIs will perturb dopaminergic signaling to the OT in mice that have learned cue-outcome
associations and investigate how neural representations in the OT evolve. The PIs hypothesize that
perturbing dopamine signaling will degrade representational stability even with continued experience. Our
studies, in addition to answering questions about the function of the OT, will also shed light more broadly on
exciting new ideas about continual learning.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Minoritized communities have the highest rates of violence exposure. However, those affected remain
underdiagnosed and untreated for resulting trauma symptoms as severe as suicidal thoughts and behaviors
(STBs) and as consequential as reactive aggression and violence perpetration. 1,2 Importantly, Black and
minoritized youth are more likely to experience traumatic events and be diagnosed with disruptive behavior
disorders,3-5 which perpetuates past criminal stereotypes that persist in the public psyche such as the
Superpredator myth 6,7 and leads to further violence exposure through over-surveillance and incarceration.8,9
Rather than effective mental healthcare access, minoritized youth are being exposed and re-exposed to cycles
of violence.
 The leading intervention for aggression and violence perpetration among youth in the US has been
incarceration. 8 There persists a perverse logic that incapacitation, which removes “would-be offenders” from
classrooms and neighborhoods, leads to safer communities; yet increased incarceration rates have not
lowered crime rates nationwide as violent crimes have actually increased. 7,8 Related, the past 50 years of
randomized control trials (RCTs) testing interventions for STBs revealed that efficacy has not improved,
treatment effect sizes are small, and there is no difference in efficacy among interventions.12 In short,
interventions aimed at suicide prevention and violence reduction have fallen short. A major factor for why these
interventions don’t show widespread success may be that violence reduction efforts have largely been limited
to the study of aggression and STBs as phenomena present in discrete groups, yet these behaviors often
co-occur to yield more severe clinical presentations. Although critical for diagnosis and treatment planning, little
is known about potential cognitive mechanisms that can help describe the function of self/other-directed
violence. The current proposal is focused on systematically describing the function of self-directed
suicidal and other-direct violent aggression using behavioral models of choice behavior and qualitative
interviews. An understanding of the constraints and preferences of individuals directly impacts treatment
engagement and effectiveness—clinical decision-making is therefore critical.14 Focus on people from
minoritized communities and their developmental risk factors may help mitigate race-based stress disparities in
healthcare and help identify systemic needs for social services that reduce barriers to accessing treatment.22-25
 This study has three main objectives: (1) to test the link between violence exposure and decision
making (2) to test the link between decision-making and self/other-directed violence among violence-exposed
youth; (3) to conduct a detailed diagnostic assessment with qualitative interviews exploring beliefs about the
function of STBs and violence perpetration among youth identified through algorithms applied to electronic
health records.

The human brain is composed of an exceptionally high diversity of cells and brain function is orchestrated by
complex interactions of these different types of cells. The enormous cellular diversity and complex
organization of the brain have so far hindered our understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms
underlying brain function. To date, it is still unclear how many different types of cells are present in the human
brain and how they are organized. We have previously developed a spatially resolved single-cell genomics
method, Multiplexed Error Robust Fluorescent In Situ Hybridization (MERFISH), which allows in situ gene-
expression profiling of individual cells and hence in situ identification and spatial mapping of transcriptionally
distinct cell types in complex tissue, including the brain. However, the technical limitations of MERFISH still
prohibit a comprehensive spatial analysis of cell types and states across the entire human brain. In this
project, we will extend MERFISH to enable higher imaging speed/throughput, 3D volumetric imaging, and
epigenomic-transcriptomic multimodal imaging, and we will use these approaches to identify cell types and
cell states, map their spatial organization, and predict cell-type-specific cell-cell interactions in the human
brain, including the aging brain. In Aim 1, we will develop methods to drastically increase MERFISH imaging
speed/throughput (by 10-fold or more) and to enable 3D volumetric MERFISH imaging of thick tissue samples,
which will further increase the imaging throughput and greatly improve our ability to capture and map cell-cell
interactions. We will also extend MERFISH to allow spatially resolved single-cell profiling of not only histone
modifications but also DNA modifications, and combine transcriptomic and epigenomic MERFISH to enable
spatial multi-omics. In Aim 2, we will use the above-described approaches to generate spatially resolved cell
atlases and cell-cell interaction maps of several human brain regions, including several cortical regions
(prefrontal cortex, primary motor cortex, primary visual cortex, and middle temporal gyrus), several regions in
the basal ganglia (caudoputamen, globus pallidus, substantia nigra, and subthalamic nucleus), and the
preoptic region of the hypothalamus. In Aim 3, we will use the MERFISH technology, including the newly
developed capabilities described above, to study the human prefrontal cortex from donors of different ages,
including advanced ages, to characterize how the composition, cell state, spatial organization, and cell-cell
interactions of molecularly defined cell types in the prefrontal cortex change during aging. Our proposed
studies will provide fundamental insights into the molecular and cellular architecture of the human brain and
how it changes during aging.

The regenerative capacity of stem cells diminishes as we age. In the case of hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs),
this loss manifests as a sustained dormancy phase without regenerating new hair follicles. Although we have
gained substantial insight into the molecular differences between young and old stem cells and their niches, a
major roadblock in identifying key genes underlying age-related changes in mammals is the lengthy process
of generating experimental genetic models (e.g., overexpression or knockout mouse lines) and then aging
them—the combination of which delays experiments by years. As such, there is a significant gap in our
understanding of the specific genes and pathways that drive age-related changes in HFSCs. Furthermore,
although there is evidence suggesting that old stem cells can be rejuvenated, specific genes that can lead to this
reversion are unknown. Addressing these knowledge gaps will substantially advance our understanding of stem
cell aging and provide a starting point for developing therapies for age-related declines in stem cell functions.
This proposal capitalizes on the expertise, tools, and techniques we have established to rapidly test multiple
candidates to identify genes that drive or suppress age-related dormancy in HFSCs and delineate the cellular
and molecular mechanisms underlying these age-related changes. Findings from us and others show that
secreted factors from dermal fibroblasts play a key role in regulating the extended dormancy seen in old HFSCs.
We have already nominated one such candidate gene, Gas6, which we have shown can reactivate dormant
HFSCs when overexpressed. In Aim 1, we will focus on delineating the cellular and molecular mechanisms by
which Gas6 drives HFSCs towards more youthful behavior. In Aim 2, we will aim to identify additional genes that
regulate HFSC aging. To enable gene testing in old mice directly and to enhance our throughput, we have
established a strategy for rapid, in vivo genetic manipulation directly in old wild-type mice by delivering targeted
genetic cargo with adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors. This strategy provides a practical route to manipulate
a relatively large number of genes in vivo, which has previously not been practical in the context of mammalian
aging. We will also use SHARE-seq, a powerful method we developed to assess both transcriptome and
chromatin changes in the same single cell. We will combine these techniques to gain insight into the cellular and
molecular mechanisms by which Gas6 and other genes function to enhance the function of old HFSCs.
Collectively, these discoveries will contribute to the basic understanding of stem cell changes that occur with
age, provide the research community with much-needed tools to accelerate aging research in vivo, and pinpoint
potential genes that can be harnessed to revert or halt age-related defects in HFSCs and beyond.

Over the past several years, we have experienced the social and physical consequences of a viral pandemic;
however, the cellular and molecular mechanisms of repair following such infections are not fully understood. The
lung serves as the site of gas exchange. Due to this function, it is constantly exposed to noxious environmental
stimuli—including bacteria and viruses. Following viral respiratory infection, many of the epithelial cells lining the
airways are lost and must be reconstituted. The epithelial-intrinsic mechanisms underlying such recovery are
well understood, but the role of the immune system in this process is not well defined. In close contact with
epithelial cells in the distal lung are alveolar macrophages, innate immune cells capable of sensing diverse
stimuli and integrating these signals into effector responses. Our previous work has shown that macrophages
engage in reciprocal growth factor exchange with fibroblasts, a communication circuit we predict to be active in
other cell types and contexts. In the lung, macrophages have been observed to help mediate inflammation and
repair via communication with epithelial cells following injury, however, the role of these interactions in the context
of viral infection remains unknown. Using a mouse-adapted influenza A virus, we observe a marked loss of
epithelial cells followed by rapid recovery, all under a constant presence of macrophages. This study aims to
determine the role of macrophages in this repair process. We hypothesize that optimal epithelial repair
requires macrophages at specific time points and anatomical locations following viral-induced damage.
We also propose that bidirectional crosstalk between macrophages and epithelial cells promotes tissue
repair. The proposed work will serve to 1) define when and where macrophages are required for optimal repair
following viral injury and 2) provide mechanistic understanding of macrophage-epithelial communication
networks in the injured and regenerating lung. Completion of this project will allow us to identify molecular targets
whose modulation may improve patient outcomes following viral infection. The Franklin lab is the ideal research
environment to perform these studies. Dr. Franklin (sponsor) is an expert in macrophage biology and has
previously unraveled interactions between macrophages and non-immune cells. Our location at Harvard Medical
School also grants access to world-class experts and resources to complete our aims. For example, Dr. Carla
Kim (co-sponsor) is an expert on lung damage and repair and will provide guidance on lung biology and epithelial
progenitor cell function following damage. Together, my mentoring team and institutional resources will help me
achieve the goals outlined in this proposal and allow me to grow both as a scientist and an individual.

Tooth decay is the most common chronic disease among U.S. children.2,3 Despite efforts to increase utilization
among minority populations by improving coverage for dental insurance via Medicaid and Children’s Health
Insurance Program (CHIP), large oral health disparities remain with Black and Hispanic children having the
poorest oral health of any racial groups in the US.5-8 In addition to lack of access to recommended care, individual
health behaviors (e.g., poor dietary and oral hygiene) and community- and provider-related structural factors
also contribute to the high risk of severe dental caries in minority populations.6,9 State Medicaid and CHIP dental
programs are encouraged to consider strategies to reduce oral health disparities in their delivery system
improvement efforts,6 however, they are challenged with improving quality and reducing quality disparities among
high-need beneficiaries in a cost-effective way.6 Steps toward successful program improvements include the
ability to validly measure the value of care (defined by both health outcomes and costs) delivered to their
beneficiaries, as well as incorporating racial/ethnic disparities in the assessment. There is a critical gap in our
understanding of the influence of race/ethnicity and its interaction with multilevel risk factors on disparities in
quality and oral health outcomes. The scientific objective of this research plan is to study multilevel determinants
of oral health and disparities in quality of dental care and assess the value of improving care and eliminating
racial/ethnic disparities in quality. In Aim 1, we will develop a risk prediction model of severe dental caries by
applying machine-learning based survival analysis4,10 on electronic health record (EHR) data to understand the
influence of race/ethnicity on progression of severe caries and explore heterogenous treatment effects of dental
care. In Aim 2, we will analyze individual-level claims in Medicaid Analytic eXtract (MAX) data combined with
multiple data sources to comprehensively measure racial/ethnic disparities in overall quality of dental care, using
evidence-based quality indicators, and identify modifiable structural risk factors creating disparities. In Aim 3,
incorporating results from Aims 1 and 2, a microsimulation model of severe caries, integrating individual-level
data with data on key contextual factors, will be developed and used to assess the cost-effectiveness and value
of improvements in care stemming from dental quality measures and eliminating racial/ethnic disparities in
quality. Findings from this study will support decision-making by policymakers and stakeholders, and will form
the basis of an R01 application to study novel strategies that target underserved and vulnerable populations.
This research plan is complemented by a career development plan that builds on the applicant’s background in
health policy and decision science. Specifically, this career development plan outlines new training in three
areas: (1) oral health epidemiology, (2) health disparities research, and (3) advanced analytics methods. The
combined research and training plan will prepare the applicant for a successful independent research career
identifying, evaluating, and implementing multilevel interventions to reduce racial/ethnic disparities in oral health.

 Although there is a robust training infrastructure in the neurosciences that is supported by NIH, there
remain several important opportunities for increasing the representation of underrepresented minorities and
other historically disadvantaged groups in brain science. There is a population of undergraduates with formal
training in the neurosciences (obtained via classroom-based work) who nevertheless have not had the
opportunity for a high-quality, longitudinal research experience. This same population frequently also lacks
access to the relevant mentorship required for success in applying to graduate school and then subsequently
for success in neuroscience research. Because longitudinal research experience is arguably one of the few
traditional admissions criteria that predict future success in graduate school, many applicants that lack such
experience are denied admission to graduate school on this basis alone. There therefore exists an educational
gap, one we propose to address here through PiNBAC, the Harvard Program in Neuroscience post-
baccalaureate program. Through the support of the Department of Neurobiology and the T32-funded Harvard
PhD Program in Neuroscience (PiN), PiNBAC was started in 2021 with an inaugural class of seven total
scholars; two of these scholars applied to graduate school this year (one will matriculate to Harvard, the other
to Yale), with the remaining five to apply in the fall. The initial iteration of PiNBAC included a substantial
research experience in which each scholar was asked to make an intellectual contribution to a project (rather
than solely serving in a technical support role), substantial mentorship both in applying to graduate school and
in the “hidden curriculum” of higher education and scientific training, integration of PiN graduate programming
to enhance PiNBAC training, and a specific longitudinal course to give each scholar space to reflect and learn
more about science from their peers. Informal feedback and early survey results suggest that the initial version
of PiNBAC has been a success: feedback from students and mentors reveals both that the program addresses
a clear gap in available educational resources, and that participants feel the program is effective at making a
difference. Here we propose to further develop PiNBAC, and to build on its strengths, by expanding the formal
neuroscience-specific curriculum offered to scholars. PiNBAC is rooted in an innovative data-driven
pedagogical approach that has been very successfully piloted in the last year. It is our hope that through this
application we can help to build the next generation of diverse leaders in the field.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
Chimeric receptor antigen (CAR) T cells are transforming cancer treatment by providing tumor-specific,
molecularly targeted therapies. However, even though current clinical applications of CAR T cell-based cancer
immunotherapies such as Kymriah or Yescarta induce remission in most cases, long-term disease control, which
is especially needed in pediatric and young adult cancer patients with high-risk malignancies, remains a major
clinical challenge. In fact, malignant relapse continues to be the leading cause of death post CAR T cell therapy.
Insufficient CAR T cell persistence in vivo is a major obstacle to reducing the risk of relapse and improving
survival. We have developed a novel platform for long-lasting tumor immunosurveillance based on continuous
in vivo generation of naïve CAR T cells. This proposal is driven by the hypothesis, based on our published and
unpublished data, that after the completion of the initial course of intensive chemotherapy long-lasting T cell
immunity to cancer antigens can be established by using hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs)
engineered to express a tumor cell-targeting CAR and delivered into the patient’s thymus. Image-guided
intrathymic injection is a minimally invasive procedure that harnesses the thymus of cancer patients as an in vivo
bioreactor, thus offering an innovative and also relatively simple and low-toxic clinical method for sustainable
production of highly potent naïve designer T cells from genetically manipulated HSPCs. Direct thymic
engraftment of HSPCs (bypassing the bone marrow) eliminates the need for myelo-ablative conditioning while
preserving the desired outcome, i.e., long-term generation of naïve antigen-specific T cells. Thymic engraftment
will be facilitated by thymic irradiation combined with either cell delivery to the thymus by intrathymic injection or
by enhancing the thymic homing capacity of intravenously administered HSPCs by overexpression of thymus-
specific homing molecules. We will focus on CD19 CARs as a model system to establish proof of concept of our
approach because CD19 CARs have become the gold standard for evaluating novel CAR technologies. Our
experimental approaches include strategies designed to allow successful thymic negative selection of CD19
CAR-transduced HSPCs. Over time the project is expected to expand to include a variety of CAR specificities.
CAR T cell development from HSPCs will be analyzed both in vitro and in vivo, including assays assessing
thymic hematopoietic stem cell maintenance and T cell differentiation from HSPCs within the thymic epithelial
microenvironment. We will demonstrate in vivo efficacy (B cell depletion and anti-tumor activity) of the most
promising CAR expression system in syngeneic mouse models. Translational studies in humanized mice,
including a patient-derived pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia model, will be performed during the final year
of the project. In sum, this research will test the novel paradigm of CAR T cell development in vivo, promising to
make tumor immunosurveillance by CAR T cells broadly available as post-consolidation therapy of high-risk
malignancies in pediatric and young adult patient populations.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
Candida auris is an emerging pan-multidrug-resistant fungal pathogen and presents a serious global health
threat. Importantly, C. auris is the first fungal pathogen showing pronounced and sometimes untreatable clinical
drug resistance to all known antifungal classes, including echinocandins azoles, and amphotericin B.
However, the diagnostic tools for the early detection of drug resistance in C. auris infections are either inadequate
or not sensitive enough for the identification of drug resistant clinical isolates. Thus, the combination of antifungal
drug resistance, along with a lack of sensitive diagnostic assays impair efficient therapeutic strategies to
overcome or prevent drug resistance in C. auris. Hence, the overall objective is to develop and validate
SuperSelective PCR assays for the detection of mutations in genes encoding echinocandin or azole resistance,
despite an abundant background of wild-type C. auris DNA. We hypothesize that SuperSelective PCR assays
will detect mutant C. auris with a sensitivity exceeding 1:104 mutant:wild type for single nucleotide polymorphisms
at genetic loci conferring echinocandin or azole resistance. The premise is based on our proof-of-concept work
with an C. auris FKS1 mutation conferring high-level echinocandin resistance. We expect to test our hypothesis
and to accomplish the objectives by pursuing two Specific Aims: 1) Develop and validate a novel SuperSelective
PCR platform to detect mutations in C. auris genes conferring resistance to echinocandin and azole antifungal
drugs. 2) Validate SuperSelective PCR assays to detect echinocandin and azole heteroresistance in the kidney
homogenates of mice with active candidiasis. The payoffs of this proposal are expected to be significant, because
the proposed study will develop a novel SuperSelective primer PCR platform to identify mutations,
heteroresistant or tolerant clinical C. auris isolates. It will also provide a framework for mechanistic understanding
of multidrug resistance in C. auris.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Candida glabrata is an opportunistic fungal pathogen associated with high mortality and whose incidence is
increasing due to its high frequency of resistance to the widely used azole antifungal class. C. glabrata also
rapidly evolves resistance to echinocandins and can become multi-drug resistant and thus virtually impossible
to treat. Drug resistance in C. glabrata is acquired via specific genetic variants. C. glabrata is also notable for its
remarkable genetic diversity, manifested by a variety of karyotypes and high levels of short nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) among strains. However, how C. glabrata facilitates genetic instability is almost entirely
unknown. A major source of genetic instability in all examined biological systems are DNA double-strand breaks
(DSBs), which mediate chromosome rearrangements and are associated with high rates of point mutations in
nearby regions. Thus, both chromosome rearrangements and SNP variation across C. glabrata strains are
consistent with DNA DSBs being the major source of this genetic diversity. Indeed, our preliminary studies
showed that C. glabrata experiences DNA breaks and develops chromosome rearrangements and drug-resistant
mutations during its interaction with host cells, e.g., while residing in macrophages, and that deletion of DSB
repair gene RAD51 in C. glabrata significantly increases the emergence of drug-resistant mutants in the mouse
gastrointestinal colonization model. This proposal is based on the hypothesis that C. glabrata has evolved
mechanisms that facilitate genetic instability upon DNA damage and that to understand these mechanisms it is
necessary to understand how C. glabrata generates and processes DNA DSBs. In Specific Aim 1, we propose
to use DSB chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by next generation sequencing (DSB-ChIP-seq) and END-
seq (a highly sensitive, unbiased next-generation sequencing technique for quantitatively mapping DSBs at
nucleotide resolution across the genome) to identify “fragile” loci prone to DSB formation in C. glabrata, based
on the hypothesis that these loci are the most likely mediators of genetic instability. In Specific Aim 2, we will use
DSB-ChIP followed by mass spectrometry (DSB-ChIP-MS) to identify C. glabrata proteins that mediate DSB
transactions. In both Aims, the roles of selected identified loci/genes in DSB formation/processing and genome
stability will be validated experimentally. The proposed study will fill a large gap in knowledge and provide
information essential for understanding how C. glabrata promotes genetic diversity and evolves drug-resistant
variants. Karyotype instability and aberrant DSB repair are also hallmarks of many cancers, and in that context
understanding the mechanisms underlying DSB formation and processing has been instrumental in developing
effective therapeutic approaches targeting DSB repair mechanisms, e.g., by using PARP inhibitors. Thus, this
proposal will provide the first understanding of DSB formation and processing in C. glabrata and may identify its
“Achilles’ heel”, i.e., a mechanism that allows it to generate genetic diversity but also makes it more sensitive to
agents that disrupt or compromise DSB repair.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：About one-third of the world's population is infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), and ≈10% of these
individuals will at some point develop active tuberculosis (TB). The risk of TB reactivation is greater in people
affected by type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and HIV, whereas, paradoxically, obesity protects against TB
disease. The underlying molecular mechanisms that explain how these co-morbidities impact TB disease
progression are mostly unknown. Although many studies have implicated incompetent immune systems to
pulmonary TB reactivation pathogenesis, our published data links pulmonary TB pathogenesis and bacterial
burden to adipose tissue (AT) pathophysiology. The objective of this proposal is to dissect the role of
adipocytes/AT in regulating immuno-metabolic mechanisms underlying pulmonary pathogenesis and examine
the significance of fat loss or adipogenesis in the pathogenesis of pulmonary TB infection. Our central
hypothesis is that an acute loss of adipocytes perturbs immuno-metabolic homeostasis in the lungs and
upsets immune-cell activation via adiponectin (an anti-inflammatory adipokine) signaling during Mtb infection.
This hypothesis is strongly supported by our published data which demonstrates that ablation of fat cells
induces pulmonary expression of adiponectin, an anti-inflammatory adipokine, and increases the levels of
foamy macrophages and elevates Mtb burden in the lungs. In addition we showed that dying adipocytes
release apoptotic bodies (ApoBDs) that express adiponectin accumulate in the lungs and may mediate
pulmonary adipogenesis in infected mice. The central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims:
1) To study the impact of fat ablation and adipogenesis in AT on pulmonary pathology and Mtb burden during
acute and chronic Mtb infections; 2) To examine the regulatory effect of gain or loss of fat cells on the
activation status of immune cells in AT and lung during acute and chronic stages of infection; and 3) To
investigate adipocytes communication mechanism(s) in regulating pulmonary adiponectin expression, immune
cells activation, and pathology during Mtb infection. This proposal is technically innovative in our use of a
combination of diet-induced adipogenic and fat-mass amendable murine TB models to manipulate body fat
mass to investigate the role of adipocytes and adipokines in regulating pulmonary TB infection severity. A
significant strength of this application is the proposed study design which includes a unique animal model, diet
intervention, different Mtb strains, two disease models and various in vitro studies. The proposed research is
significant, because it will identify the molecular links between adipocyte physiology and TB and dissect the
role of adiponectin signaling in the pathogenesis and severity of pulmonary TB infection. The results will have
an important positive impact because the proposed studies will help facilitate the identification of therapeutic
targets for early intervention in populations at risk for TB reactivation and will impact clinical decisions
regarding TB clinical management.

Most advanced cancer patients do not have an accurate understanding of their prognosis and treatment, which
interferes with patient-centered, high-quality healthcare. Gaining such information often requires patients to
confront stressful clinical discussions while understanding complex medical information. Existing interventions
to improve understanding largely target information delivery, without assessing and reducing psychological
barriers to hearing prognostic information accurately. This Pathway to Independence Award will equip Dr.
Heather Derry with the necessary skills to launch her independent research career, in which she aims to
identify and reduce stress-related barriers to informed medical decision-making among patients with cancer.
The candidate's prior work suggests that anxiety may reduce patients' accuracy for recently-discussed scan
results (used to monitor disease progression and inform treatment). In this career development award, the PI
will: (1) solidify targets and methods for a stress management intervention to improve patients' understanding
of prognostic information (i.e., scan results), then (2) adapt, revise, and (3) pilot test a stress management
program to reduce anxiety prior to key prognostic discussions. At Weill Cornell Medicine's distinguished Center
for Research on End-of-Life Care, the PI will receive expert mentorship and complete specialized training in
advanced cancer and end-of-life care, intervention adaptation and clinical trials, advanced psychophysiology
and statistics, and leadership. In the K99 phase, the PI will conduct an observational study to confirm pilot data
linking psychological factors to patient understanding, and investigate vagal tone (measured by heart rate
variability) as an underlying physiological mechanism for this pattern. Before an appointment to discuss scan
results during first-line treatment, 75 patients with advanced gastrointestinal or lung cancer will complete
assessments of resting heart rate and self-reported anxiety, worry, and anticipatory stress. After the
appointment, patients will report their understanding of those scan results. Patients' answers will be compared
to audio-recorded clinical visits for accuracy. Analyses will test relationships between accuracy, psychological
factors, and heart rate variability. Qualitative interviews will elicit patients' preferences for intervention
adaptations and delivery methods. In the R00 phase, the PI will use this information to adapt an existing stress
management program (a public resource) to mitigate anxiety (and/or other targets) prior to these appointments.
Finally, the intervention's feasibility, acceptability, and potential efficacy will be tested in a pilot randomized
trial, compared with usual care. Overall, the project will begin to address key psychological and physiological
factors missing from prior attempts to improve advanced cancer patients' understanding of prognostic
information. Given her prior training and research in health psychology, strong mentorship team, and proposed
training plan, Dr. Derry is well-positioned to become an independent investigator in this area, with the overall
goal of increasing quality of life and quality of care for people with advanced cancer.

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) causes the blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction and transmigration of
inflammatory immune cells into the brain, an important mechanism underlying neurovascular damage and
neuroinflammation. Adhesion of leukocytes to endothelial cells is a critical step in the migration of leukocytes
into injured tissues. Previously, it has been demonstrated that activation of leukocytes, especially neutrophils
cause the release of nuclear and granular contents to form an extensive web-like structure of DNA called
neutrophil extracellular traps (NET). However, in TBI, the mechanism of injury-induced formation of NET and
its mechanistic regulatory role in thrombosis remains elusive. Moreover, it is not clear whether blocking of
formation of NET provides better outcomes after TBI. Therefore, an approach to suppress the formation of
NET would be a valuable therapeutic strategy and to analyze the efficacy of the therapy in the functional
recovery level after TBI. Here, we hypothesize that inhibition of peptidyl arginine deiminase type 4 (PAD4), an
enzyme required for NET formation, using PAD4 antagonistic peptide (PAP) will attenuate the formation of
NET, NET-induced thrombosis, and promote neovascularization and functional recovery after TBI. In the first
aim, we test whether PAP reduces PAD4 expression, inhibits NET formation, and promotes
neovascularization. In the second specific aim, we will uncover the molecular mechanisms of the formation of
NET-induced thrombosis in TBI and we will dissect the therapeutic role of PAP in depleting NET-dependent
thrombosis. We will validate the role of PAD4 in the formation of NET and its role in thrombosis by
CRISPR/Cas9 mediated PAD4 gene deletion in human brain microvascular endothelial cells (hBMVECs) and
human neutrophil co-culture in vitro and PAD4 knockout (KO) mice (PAD4−/−) in vivo. In addition, we will study
the role of different brain cells in NET formation by creating conditional knockout mice by breeding PAD4flox
strain with specific brain cell Cre strains. In the third aim, we will use a cohort of behavioral tests that include
sensorimotor functions, memory, and psychological stress analyses to validate the role of PAP in promoting
functional recovery following TBI. Therefore, in this project, to validate the central hypothesis, these three aims
target a subset of events towards unraveling a larger picture of neurovascular remodeling and functional
recovery after TBI by attenuating PAD4 activity using a novel small peptide developed in the PI’s lab.

In this grant we propose three aims focused on exploring the following: (Aim 1) Determine the
efferent target selectivity of granular and infragranular SST cINs and determine the developmental
strategy by which this is achieved. (Aim 2) Explore the developmental molecular and cellular
basis by which SST cIN diversity is generated. (Aim 3) Identify and validate the SST prototypes
during late embryonic and early developmental periods that give rise to the nine SST cIN cell
types that populate the mature cortex.
 A chief goal of my laboratory is to determine cortical interneuron diversity contributes
selectively to cortical function and how perturbations in these programs result in brain disease.
This grant is an exemplar of the multidisciplinary approaches that has become our hallmark and
combines individuals with skills ranging from molecular biology, transcriptomic analysis, genetics
and physiology. By combining these with the Fishell laboratory's expertise in development,
genetics and circuit formation, we will explore in this proposal how developmental programs in
SST cINs shape them selective synaptic connectivity.
 Together, this grant represents a broad scale effort to both develop and test the
proposition that cortical circuits are much more precisely crafted such that the bewildering
diversity we have discovered in excitatory and inhibitory neurons reflects a level of circuit
organization that we are only beginning to understand. From our preliminary data it is evident
that canonical cortical circuits are much more precise and specific to particular subtypes. By
defining their relationships, as well as the molecular mechanisms that dictate their synaptic
specificity, this work will greatly increase both our understanding of cINs, as well as the
microcircuits they contribute to. This in turn will greatly extend our understanding of how
discrete cIN and pyramidal neurons interact in the obligate lock and key mechanisms that allow
their assembly.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
Failure to achieve accurate chromosome segregation during meiosis is a leading cause of miscarriages,
infertility, and birth defects such as Down syndrome. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms underlying
accurate meiotic chromosome segregation is of paramount importance to human health. The synaptonemal
complex (SC) is a zipper-like structure present from yeast to humans during meiosis that assembles between
homologous chromosomes, stabilizing homologous pairing interactions and promoting interhomolog crossover
formation. However, despite its importance for achieving accurate meiotic chromosome segregation, the
mechanisms regulating chromosome synapsis and how the SC interfaces with recombination and chromosome
remodeling is not well understood in any organism. Our goal is to identify mechanisms regulating the SC and to
determine how SC regulation is linked to DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair progression and late prophase
I chromosome remodeling to ensure accurate meiotic chromosome segregation. We study this in the nematode
C. elegans because it shares a high degree of gene conservation with humans and affords ease of genetic,
cytological, molecular, and biochemical analysis for germline studies. Our progress during the previous funding
period, coupled with new data and molecular targets, place us in an ideal position to understand the regulation
and roles of chromosome synapsis during meiosis. Here we propose two integrated aims to address these critical
issues. Aim 1 will determine how HIM-22, a protein which shares sequence conservation with yeast Set3 and
human ASH1L, regulates SC formation. HIM-22 promotes protein deacetylation in the germline, interacts with a
structural component of the SC, and is required for regulating SC assembly, crossover levels, and late prophase
I chromosome remodeling; this will define a previously unknown meiotic role for this protein modifier in a
metazoan and a new mode of SC regulation. Aim 2 will determine how NatF-mediated N-terminal acetylation of
meiotic proteins regulates the SC. Our studies show that NatF is required for protein acetylation in the germline,
and regulates SC assembly/disassembly, DSB repair progression, crossover distribution, and late prophase I
chromosome remodeling. We previously found that NatB-mediated N-terminal acetylation of a structural
component of the SC promotes SC assembly. Our past studies on NatB and our current discovery of NatF as a
potential regulator of the SC suggest there is a conserved yet poorly understood regulatory network of different
N-acetyltransferases acting on chromosome synapsis. These studies will shed new light on our understanding
of the mechanisms regulating chromosome synapsis and how these link the SC to DSB repair and late prophase
I chromosome remodeling. Our studies will impact multiple fields of tremendous relevance to human health
including chromosome dynamics, the study of post-translational modifications, and regulation of macromolecular
structures. Taken together, this application will provide novel insights into the molecular mechanisms regulating
accurate chromosome segregation during meiosis.

 The most fundamental event in the initiation of hearing is the conversion of sound into an electrical signal
by the opening of ion channels in hair cells. We know that TMC1 and TMC2 are the pore-forming subunits of
the mechanotransduction complex, we know the general tertiary structure of TMCs, and we know which
transmembrane domains constitute the pore. But we now need to know specifically how the sound-evoked
increase in tip-link tension leads to channel opening: how does PCDH15 in the tip link attach to TMC1, what
moves in TMC1 to open the pore, and how does tension propagate through the TMC channel to cause that
opening?
 In this project we will first identify the parts of PCDH15 that bind to TMC1, using a combination of co-
immunoprecipitation, biolayer interferometry, protein biochemistry, site-directed mutagenesis, and single-cell
electrophysiology. Mutagenesis will be guided by cryo-electron microscopy of a related TMC channel and by
new atomic structures generated by structure-prediction software such as AlphaFold2. We will then identify
the parts of TMC1 that bind to PCDH15, using the same methods. In parallel, we will evaluate recent data from
other laboratories on regions of LHFPL5 that bind to TMC1.
 To understand the gating of TMC1, we will use additional protein structure predictions from AlphaFold2
to identify different conformational states of TMC1 that may represent open and closed states of the channel.
Combining knowledge of the binding interface and the predicted gating transitions, we can use molecular
dynamics to determine whether and how the application of force—through either PCDH15 or LHFPL5—tends
to produce channel opening.
 We will then test the models generated by molecular dynamics, by introducing cysteine residues at key
locations in TMC and transiently linking them with heavy metal ions or bivalent MTS reagents. These bridges
will lock TMC in one or another conformation. By expressing different cysteine mutants in hair cells and
applying these reagents while recording transduction currents, we can determine whether open or closed states
are favored, and thereby test the predicted gating movements. We will also test whether predicted movement
of an intracellular loop drives the gating movement, by inserting flexible peptide sequences.
 This will generate an atomic-level understanding of mechanotransduction, unprecedented for hair cells
or for any eukaryotic force-gated ion channel. It will also provide deep insight into the function of TMC1 and
PCDH15, and how mutations in these proteins cause hereditary deafness.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Autoimmune diseases are a growing health problem: there are many of them (>100); they are quite
frequent in toto (~10% of Americans); and their incidence has been increasing for decades. Autoimmunity results
from a breakdown in one or more central or peripheral mechanisms of lymphocyte tolerance induction or
maintenance. In the case of T cells, central tolerance is imposed within the thymus, key orchestrators being
medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs), which play critical roles in both negative selection of T effector cells
and positive selection of T regulatory cells (Tregs). A unique feature of mTECs is expression of hundreds of loci
encoding antigens typically associated with fully differentiated peripheral parenchymal cells (peripheral-tissue
antigens or PTAs). Most of this “misplaced” gene expression is driven by the transcriptional regulator Aire. Loss
of Aire in both mice and humans results in a multi-organ autoimmune disease; in addition, recent studies have
uncovered an association of Aire with several common human autoimmune diseases.
 During the last funding-cycle, we serendipitously discovered a second, previously unappreciated arm of
thymocyte tolerization: thymic mimetic cells. These cells are a heterogeneous set of (mostly) Aire-dependent,
post-Aire mTECs that have co-opted the lineage-defining transcription factors (LDTFs), chromatin-accessibility
landscapes, and gene-expression profiles of particular extra-thymic cell-types, while maintaining their mTEC
identity. To date, 15 different mimetic-cell subtypes have been identified, including tuft, muscle, ciliated, microfold
and sebocyte mTECs. Accrual of thymic mimetic cells depends critically on the LDTF(s) they express and
differentially on Aire. Directing expression of a neoantigen to mimetic cells tolerizes cognate thymocytes.
 Building on this discovery, and abiding by the molecular focus of this grant, THE OVERALL GOAL OF
THIS PROPOSED PROJECT IS TO ELUCIDATE THE MOLECULAR MECHANISMS UNDERLYING MIMETIC
mTEC GENERATION, IN PARTICULAR MOLECULAR RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE AIRE-BASED
AND MIMETIC-CELL BASED PATHWAYS OF T-CELL TOLERANCE INDUCTION. This goal will be addressed
by three independent and cross-informing Aims:
A. To determine how Aire and LDTFs influence each other’s genomic activities.
B. To determine how modulating the binding of Aire to chromatin in Aire-stage mTECs influences the
accrual of mimetic-cell subtypes at the post-Aire stage.
C. To unravel the lineage relationships of thymic mimetic cells.
 This study will yield novel (potentially the first) information on how thymic mimetic cells are generated –
in particular how the Aire-based and mimetic-cell-based arms of thymocyte tolerance induction are integrated.
This information should prove highly valuable in both dissecting mechanisms of diverse autoimmune diseases
and, potentially, manipulating thymic cells or molecules to treat or avoid them.

The lateral septum (LS) is an inhibitory limbic brain structure long thought to be essential for threat processing
and defensive behavior. In part due to its anatomical and molecular heterogeneity, the precise means by which
the LS mediates these processes remains elusive. To this end, I have focused my graduate work on LS neurons
expressing the stress-related Corticotropin releasing hormone type II receptor (LS-Crhr2). CRH-family G-protein
coupled receptors (GPCRs) are critical for behavioral and physiological stress responses and are implicated in
mood and anxiety disorders, providing a direct link between this subset of LS neurons and a central stress
system. Moreover, LS-Crhr2 neurons are activated by innate threats, and its activity modulates concomitant
defensive responses, evokes physiological arousal, and elicits aversion. The overall goal of these studies is to
determine the molecular and functional organization of LS-Crhr2 neurons in threat processing. Threat
processing, however, is multifaceted and largely involves the ability to rapidly detect and evaluate sensory stimuli
as potential threats in order to respond with the appropriate behavioral defenses. To capture this complexity, I
use two-way signaled active avoidance, a behavioral paradigm in which mice learn to perform goal-directed
avoidance behaviors in response to punishment-predictive cues. Using microendoscopic calcium imaging,
optogenetics, and single-nuclei RNA sequencing, I have thus far established the following: 1) LS-Crhr2
population activity is required for executing learned avoidance; 2) LS-Crhr2 population activity dynamically codes
threat cues in a manner predicting defense decisions and upcoming action initiation; 3) LS-Crhr2 comprises of
ten functional subclasses (defined by calcium dynamics) specialized in distinct threat-related processes; and 4)
LS-Crhr2 comprises of ten molecular subclasses (defined by transcriptomics) with unique anatomical
organization. Building on these observations, the central goal of this study is to identify how these molecular LS-
Crhr2 subsets mediate specific threat-related processes and how they are dynamically recruited. In the following
aims, we will use viral-genetic strategies to monitor and manipulate the activity of these molecularly-defined
subclasses, which together comprise of roughly 84% of the total LS-Crhr2 population. Aim 1 will use
microendoscopic calcium imaging of single neurons to determine whether each molecular subclass maps to
functional LS-Crhr2 clusters whose neural activity dynamics resemble discrete threat-related processes during
active avoidance. Aim 2 will use optogenetics to directly inhibit the activity of each subset to test their role in
these distinct processes. The successful completion of these aims will capture how the molecular diversity of
LS-Crhr2 neurons maps to function, thereby providing a framework for understanding the role of LS in threat
processing and, more generally, for studying the role of discrete functional units of cells that express druggable
GPCRs of interest.

Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy is a therapeutic approach that blocks pathways that inhibit anti-tumor
immunity and activates the immune system to fight cancer. Although ICI therapy has seen significant success
in some patients, unfortunately, most eligible patients still fail to respond to treatment. Several studies have
highlighted the modulatory capacity of the microbial composition of the gut microbiome as well as certain
organisms to direct a patient’s response to ICI. Our preliminary data show that the human gut commensal
Bacteroides ovatus 8483 has the capacity to enhance ⍺-PD-L1 (Programmed Death-Ligand 1) therapy in
germ-free (GF) and antibiotic-treated mice. The lipooligosaccharide (LOS) of B. ovatus is a major cell surface
molecule comprising about 50% of the surface of this microbe’s outer membrane. The LOS exists naturally in
several different structural analogs. We have found that among the many analogs of lipid A produced by B.
ovatus, an orally delivered tetra-acylated monophosphorylated lipid A (4A-MPLA) can potently enhance the
efficacy of ⍺-PD-L1 in mice that would otherwise fail to clear tumors. We propose to determine whether 4A-
MPLA could serve as a novel therapeutic for enhancing the current cancer immunotherapy arsenal. Our long-
term goal is to use 4A-MPLA in combination with PD-1 pathway blockade to treat cancer patients, particularly
non-responders to ⍺-PD-L1 alone.
Over the course of the next two years, we aim to understand: 1) the cell types and signaling pathways by
which 4A-MPLA influences local and systemic improvement of the ⍺-PD-L1 response, and 2) understand the
types of cancers that may respond to this treatment. Given our preliminary studies demonstrating the effect of
B. ovatus on colonic regulatory T cells (Tregs), we hypothesize that B. ovatus is affecting peripheral Tregs in
the colon and disrupting their ability to restrain antitumor immunity. To test this hypothesis, we will compare the
immune profiles of cells in several tissues including the gut lamina propria, mesenteric lymph nodes, tumor
draining lymph nodes, and the tumor itself in gnotobiotic, antibiotic-treated, and specific-pathogen-free (SPF)
mice treated with 4A-MPLA compared to controls. Tregs as well as other relevant compartments of the tumor
microenvironment (TME), such as CD8+ and CD4+ T cells, NK cells, NKT cells, B cells, dendritic cells, M1 and
M2 macrophages, and monocytic and granulocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells, will be analyzed in mouse
tumor models for immunologic responses to ⍺-PD-L1 therapy with or without 4A-MPLA. Finally, we will
determine which murine tumor models respond to this therapy to better predict its clinical applicability.

tuberculosis (TB), not all patients experience treatment success. Existing literature on other risk
factors for unfavorable TB treatment outcomes is limited in at least two important ways that
preclude an actionable evidence-based response. First, analyses are typically conducted using
predictive modelling or multivariable regression techniques that do not consider the underlying
causal structure of the factor and TB outcome. These approaches are inadequate for informing
interventions because they are not designed for causal inference and can lead to results that are
biased, and/or uninterpretable. Second, analyses of pre-treatment (i.e., baseline) factors do not
elucidate the mediating mechanism through which an unfavorable treatment outcome occurs. For
example, hepatitis C infection may lead to unfavorable tuberculosis treatment outcomes through
multiple pathways, including advanced liver disease that reduces bioavailability, as well as
suboptimal adherence to TB treatment. An effective adherence intervention would be expected
to improve outcomes under the latter scenario, but not the former. Therefore, analyses elucidating
the extent to which treatment adherence mediates the relationship between a given factor and
treatment outcomes will be required to inform relevant interventions for the patients that need
them most, thereby ensuring that all patients with TB benefit fully from the latest scientific
advances. We propose to elevate existing analyses of factors that lead to unfavorable TB
treatment outcomes through a novel framework for analyzing causes of unfavorable TB treatment
outcomes; one that is grounded in causal inference and evaluates adherence as a potentially
intervenable pathway. Our team of experts in TB, treatment adherence, and epidemiologic
methods will leverage a unique longitudinal dataset of 2,789 patients receiving MDR/RR-TB
treatment under routine program conditions in one of 17 countries on five continents. The overall
goal of the proposal is to generate more valid, relevant, and actionable data with regard to TB risk
factors, with the overall goal of informing interventions to reduce TB-related morbidity and
mortality. Specifically, we will (1) estimate the causal effect of key baseline exposures (e.g., HIV,
hepatitis B and/or C, low body mass index, substance use, cavitary disease with a highly positive
sputum smear, age, and gender) on end-of-treatment outcomes; and (2) determine the extent to
which each causal effect is mediated by suboptimal adherence to treatment, and examine other
potential mediating pathways.

In 2011 the Institute of Medicine (now the National Academy of Medicine) convened a panel to explore the
paradox of why the US spends more on healthcare than other developed countries yet has inferior outcomes.
It concluded that “Data are simply lacking to fully understand the causal factors responsible for each of the
diseases and injuries that disproportionately affect the US population.” This is still true today. What’s notable is
that the US has shorter life expectancy with the 2nd highest cardiovascular death rate among peer countries
while still having the highest spending in the world (19.7% of gross domestic product).
In 2019 Drs. Cram and Landon founded the International Health Systems Research Collaborative (IHSRC)
with funding from the NIH (NIA R01AG058878) to compare treatment and outcomes across high-income
countries for cohorts of patients defined by common diagnoses and procedures. The current proposal will
leverage and expand upon our IHSRC infrastructure to compare health technology assessment (HTA) across
countries and evaluate how HTA relates to the utilization, adoption, and de-adoption of new cardiovascular
(CV) treatments and procedures. Many countries (including IHSRC members England, Netherlands and
Canada) have explicit HTA processes linked to public insurance coverage decisions for new therapies. The US
is notable for lacking a formal HTA process. While failure to embrace HTA likely contributes to excessively high
spending in the US, few studies have evaluated how different countries approach HTA.
The overarching objective of our research is to understand how advanced CV therapies are adopted and used
in 7 countries with advanced healthcare systems. Our research will focus on 3 cardiovascular condition dyads
where introduction/refinements in advanced therapy is disrupting an established therapy: 1) aortic valve
dysfunction where transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is in the process of supplanting surgical
aortic valve replacement (SAVR); 2) elective AAA repair where endovascular aneurysm repair is replacing
open repair; and 3) carotid artery stenosis where trans-carotid artery revascularization (TCAR) and stenting are
emerging as substitutes for carotid endarterectomy. Our research will address major unanswered questions by
providing crucial insights into how advanced technologies are adopted and used in different countries. We will
provide much needed clarity with respect to the ongoing and unanswered question of whether higher spending
in the US can be attributed to more rapid adoption and higher utilization of advanced therapies.
Our proposal has three specific aims that assess: (1) each country’s policy and health technology assessment
environment related to each procedure; (2) technology diffusion patterns in the context of their evolving policy
environments; and (3) differences in outcomes, including mortality, readmissions, and hospital-free days at
home. The scientific premise of our proposal is that granular information is needed to inform the study of
comparative health systems and to understand the adoption and diffusion of new technologies.

Animals, including humans, navigate through a noisy environment that can damage the ear and elicit whole body
changes in physiology and emotional state. The response to stressors such as noise is important for survival,
for instance by altering gain for improved detection of salient stimuli. However, excessive noise has dire
consequences, such as death of hair cells or neurons and their synapses. It is therefore essential to have a
balanced response to stress that is appropriate for the internal state of the animal. The goal of this project is to
study how neurons outside of the cochlea work together to protect both the cochlea and the animal from
environmental stressors. We hypothesize that stress recruits two parallel sets of efferent inputs to the cochlea:
the lateral olivocochlear neurons (LOCs) and the inner ear sympathetic neurons (IESNs). LOC axons project
from the brainstem to the organ of Corti, where they terminate on a variety of SGN subtypes across many
frequencies. IESNs housed in the stellate ganglion innervate the cochlear vasculature and regulate cochlear
blood flow, consistent with the sympathetic nervous system’s role in the fight-or-flight response. In addition,
IESNs in the superior cervical ganglion extend axons through the osseous spiral lamina, intermingling with
afferent and efferent fibers here and terminating close to the unmyelinated endings of the SGN peripheral
processes. Although a role in stress response has long been proposed, we know very little about the impact of
LOCs and IESNs on cochlear function or resilience, due in large part to the inability to manipulate either
population selectively. In preliminary studies, we characterized the molecular and anatomical properties of LOCs
and showed that they induce neuropeptides in response to noise. In addition, using genetic tools that we
established, we showed that mice lacking LOCs are more vulnerable noise-induced hearing loss than control
littermates, providing compelling evidence for a protective role in the cochlea. In parallel, we showed that IESN
axons contain pre-synaptic puncta that are apposed to afferent and efferent fibers, as well as cochlear
macrophages. Based on these observations and the known importance of neuropeptides for neuroimmune
responses in other systems, we propose that stressful stimuli activate LOCs and IESNs, which cooperate to alter
both auditory circuit activity, via their interactions with each other and the SGNs, and the immune response, with
long-lasting effects on cochlear function. To test this idea, we will use mouse genetics, viral tracing methods,
slice electrophysiology, modern in vivo recording approaches, single cell RNA-sequencing, and in vivo assays
to characterize LOC responses to noise and other stressors, to map the molecular and anatomical properties of
IESNs, and to investigate how LOCs and IESNs impact the immune system and hence cochlear health.

Alphaviruses are mosquito-transmitted, positive-strand enveloped RNA viruses that cause severe diseases in
humans, including lethal encephalitis. Despite their epidemic potential, there are no FDA-approved antivirals or
vaccines against any alphavirus infection. Infections by certain alphaviruses have increased in recent years,
likely secondary to climate change. Eastern equine encephalitis virus, Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus, and
Western equine encephalitis virus cause outbreaks in horses and humans in the Americas. While all three viruses
pose threats to public health, among them, eastern equine encephalitis virus carries the highest case fatality rate
(30-80%). Of those who survive eastern equine encephalitis virus infection, most are left with permanent
neurological damage. The cellular receptors that most alphaviruses bind to when infecting cells have remained
elusive, and this knowledge gap has limited our understanding of key determinants of alphavirus pathogenesis
and of pathways for potential therapeutic intervention through molecules that block virus receptor binding. Our
lab recently discovered that very low-density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR) and apolipoprotein E receptor 2, two
LDLR-related proteins that are also expressed in the brain, are cellular receptors for eastern equine encephalitis
virus. Western equine encephalitis virus had unknown receptors. We identified related and unrelated membrane
proteins that are highly enriched in the brain as receptors for western equine encephalitis virus. We hypothesize
that binding to VLDLR, ApoER2, or the newly identified receptors explains mechanisms for differential cellular
entry, tissue distribution, and viral pathogenesis of different encephalitic alphaviruses. In Aim 1, we will study
whether eastern equine encephalitis virus entry into physiologically relevant brain cell types (neurons, astrocytes,
and microglial cells) critically depends on VLDLR and ApoER2 and determine if blockade of these receptors can
protect mice from viral encephalitis. In Aim 2, we will evaluate whether western equine encephalitis virus binding
to its receptors is also a critical determinant of infection of human brain cell types in vitro and of
neuropathogenesis in mice. In Aim 3, we will determine high-resolution cryo-electron microscopy structures of
virus-like particles bound to different alphavirus receptors. Our studies may pave the way for the design of
inhibitors that help combat alphavirus encephalitis by preventing attachment to cellular receptors and help
address an urgent need for antivirals against these important human pathogens.

Pulpitis is a painful disease of the dental pulp tissue, which is treated by expensive and invasive dental
procedures such as root canal treatments and tooth extractions. A limited understanding of the intermingling
mechanisms of inflammation and pain involving the innate immune response and the dense innervation of the
pulp tissue jointly, precludes the precise application of conservative treatments and the development of novel
pain management strategies. In this project, the principal investigator will focus on the roles of neutrophils in
nerve injury and pain during pulpitis, and how nociceptive neurons modulate innate immune response. Moreover,
she proposes to study neuro-immune interactions during pulpitis not only limited within the pulp tissue but in the
pulp-periodontium complex where these two neighboring tissues are neuroanatomically connected. The central
hypothesis of the study is that during pulpitis, inflammation is present in the pulp and also in the periodontium,
and it is modulated by nociceptive neurons, and driven by neutrophils which regulate sensory and pain outcomes.
In Aim 1 of the K99 phase, Dr. Erdogan will identify neutrophil-driven nerve injury and pain outcomes during
pulpitis by using different clinically informed animal models of pulpitis, perform pharmacological manipulations
of neutrophils, use tissue-clearing and whole-mount imaging, single-nuclei RNA sequencing and in-situ
hybridization to detect anatomical and transcriptional changes of neurons. She will also use evoked and non-
evoked pain behavior assays. In Aim 2 of the K99 phase, Dr. Erdogan will identify the impact of silencing
nociceptive neurons on neutrophil recruitment and responses in the pulp tissue during pulpitis. She will use
chemogenetic and DREADD-based approaches to silence certain subsets of neurons and perform flow
cytometry and sensitive ELISA-based assays to assess innate immune responses. In the R00 phase of the
award, in Aim 3, Dr. Erdogan will identify the mechanisms and unique signatures of inflammation in the
neighboring periodontium during pulpitis, focusing on neuronal-driven inflammation, by using in-vivo dental pulp
neuron activation models and pulpitis models. She will investigate neurogenic inflammatory mechanisms, and
outcomes and establish the framework and understanding of how the neighboring periodontium anticipates and
responds to diseases affecting the pulp tissue. During the K99 mentored phase, Dr. Erdogan will learn the skills
and cutting-edge techniques necessary to accomplish the proposed research under the guidance of expert
scientists Dr. Isaac M. Chiu (primary mentor), Dr. Jennifer L. Gibbs (co-mentor), Dr. William Renthal and Dr.
Thomas Van Dyke (collaborators) who collectively have an extensive track record of training scientists and
dentist-scientists. The proposed scientific and career development training during the K99 phase of the award
will support Dr. Erdogan in her transition to being an independent dentist-scientist.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Sensory experience shapes the maturation of neural circuits during critical periods of development. How early-
life experience modifies synaptic connectivity to refine sensory information processing remains a central question
in neurobiology. Neurons respond to external sensory experience through the rapid, activity-dependent
transcription of immediate early gene (IEG) transcription factors (TFs), such as Fos, Npas4, and Egr1. Once
expressed, IEGs regulate a wave of late-response genes (LRGs) that mediate the influence of activity on synaptic
remodeling in a cell type-specific manner. In particular, activity-dependent transcription of the neurotrophin
Bdnf/BDNF within excitatory neurons establishes the critical period for ocular dominance plasticity in the visual
cortex by promoting the formation of inhibitory synapses onto excitatory neuron cell bodies. However, specific
mechanisms by which BDNF mediates this unique form of synaptic plasticity, known as somatic inhibition, remain
poorly understood. Although BDNF influences gene transcription, whether BDNF regulates transcription within
specific neuron types to direct inhibitory synapses onto neuronal soma is not yet known. This project seeks to
identify and characterize the genomic mechanisms by which BDNF regulates somatic inhibition in the mouse
visual cortex. Aim 1 of this proposal uses a transgenic mouse line that lacks activity-dependent Bdnf transcription
to identify BDNF-regulated genes and gene regulatory elements during visual cortex development. The
experiments in Aim 1 test the hypothesis that BDNF regulates the transcription of key synaptic organizer genes
in a cell type-specific manner to drive the formation of somatic inhibitory synapses. Aim 2 of this proposal seeks
to identify specific IEG TFs that mediate the effects of BDNF on transcriptional activation. Recently, I discovered
that the neuron-specific IEG TF, Egr4/EGR4, preferentially responds to BDNF in primary cortical neurons and
binds the NuA4/TIP60 histone acetyltransferase complex in vitro. In this aim, I will use immunoprecipitation mass
spectrometry and CUT&RUN to determine the interaction partners and genomic binding sites of EGR4 in mouse
visual cortex. Given that NuA4/TIP60 both activates transcription and repairs transcription-coupled DNA double-
strand breaks (DSBs), I will further test the hypothesis that EGR4 mediates BDNF-dependent DSB repair.
Collectively, the proposed studies will provide novel insights into how BDNF regulates the maturation of cortical
circuits and, more broadly, how neurons achieve stimulus-specific transcriptional regulation and genomic
maintenance. Improved understanding of these processes will inform the study of neurological disorders that
display a loss of BDNF production, including Alzheimer’s and Huntingtin’s disease.

The mammalian cortex consists of many transcriptionally distinct neuronal cell types connected in intricate
circuits. Much work has shown that risk genes associated with developmental disorders such as schizophrenia,
autism spectrum disorder, epilepsy and intellectual disorder encode synaptic proteins enriched in cortical
interneurons (cIN). However, not much is known about how cINs integrate into cortical circuits during
development. Thus, understanding how this process occurs will allow us to understand how the cortex develops
in both healthy and pathophysiological states. Early studies used electrophysiological and morphological
analysis to define four cardinal classes of interneurons with varying levels of heterogeneity within those classes.
More recent advances in single-cell, spatial and combinatorial transcriptomic techniques have uncovered an
even wider breadth of diversity. The somatostatin (SST) class is of particular interest because they are enriched
in infragranular layers of the cortex yet display highly specialized targeting of pyramidal neuron dendrites. This
requires them to extend their axons across multiple layers to connect to their synaptic partners. Their role in
routing feedback inhibition suggests that they influence dendritic computations in pyramidal neurons (PNs) by
regulating information flow. Proper maturation of cortex requires SST interneurons to successfully integrate into
cortical circuits, yet the cellular and subcellular specificity in efferent targeting of SST interneuron subtypes is
currently unknown. The molecular and genetic tools that have been generated and validated in our lab has
positioned me to utilize slice physiology, immunohistochemistry and viral labeling methods to not only investigate
the specificity in SST subtype connectivity, but also to evaluate how this arises in development. As yet, it is
unknown whether SST efferent targeting is initially specific or refined across development. Furthermore, recent
work has shown that SST interneurons transiently target PV interneurons during development and that this is
instructive to the formation of PV microcircuits. Thus, it is likely that SST circuit integration is dynamic across
development. Therefore, I also aim to determine how SST efferent specificity arises and whether transient
connectivity’s exist across development. However, the study of the assembly of cortical microcircuits must
consider developmental activity, as much work has uncovered the dependance of interneuron maturation and
circuit integration on intrinsic activity. Given the incredible advances in transcriptomics clarifying the diversity
within the SST interneuron class, and the viral and transgenic tools that now exist to target, label and manipulate
specific cortical neuron subtypes, we are now well positioned to assess the role of developmental intrinsic activity
on synaptic specificity. Thus, in my final set of experiments, I will determine the role of developmental activity in
SST circuit integration and the critical period for this activity in proper synaptic maturation of SST subtype-specific
microcircuits. The project that I have proposed is designed to fill the gap in knowledge of how SST subtypes

Biological Novelty through Adaptive Protein Synthesis in the Octopus
 Dysregulation of proteostasis coincides with the accumulation and aggregation of misfolded proteins,
leading to neurodegeneration and pathogenesis of diseases such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and
Spinocerebellar ataxia. As the machinery responsible for synthesis of correctly decoded, functional proteins,
ribosomes play a major role in determining proteostasis. Biochemical or genetic disruptions to ribosome accuracy
are known to disrupt cellular proteostasis, causing neuronal death and severe cognitive or aging related defects.
However, there has been minimal exploration of how to increase translation accuracy, and how this impacts
proteostasis. Octopus bimaculoides presents an ideal model to study adaptation of the ribosome to improve
proteostasis in a multicellular organism. Octopuses rely heavily on proteostasis, as they develop rapidly and
possess extremely complex nervous systems consisting of approximately 500 million neurons, the most of any
invertebrate animal. I recently made the serendipitous discovery that the large 28S rRNA of the octopus contains
a unique rRNA break in the highly conserved catalytic center of the ribosome. This rRNA break is conserved
among octopuses but not other cephalopods or mollusks. Importantly, my preliminary findings reveal that the
octopus rRNA break increases accuracy of protein synthesis. By obtaining a cryo-EM structure of the O.
bimaculoides ribosome, I find the octopus-specific break is found in the E-site near the site of deacylated tRNA
binding. I propose to determine how this modification affects the ribosome and manifests in larger phenotypes
through a combination of biochemical, structural, and cellular approaches. I will compare the direct functional
consequences of this modification to the ribosomal active site by utilizing ribosome-dependent in vitro
reconstitution assays. This will be complemented by performing cryo-EM on the octopus ribosome in different
states of protein synthesis to determine how these functional changes manifest on a molecular level on the
ribosome. Lastly, I will investigate differences in protein aggregation and resistance to neurotoxicity mediated by
this novel ribosomal modification. This will be investigated in vitro using my reconstitution system, and in vivo
through a comparative biology approach with animal neuron primary culture. I will also utilize a yeast genetics
model to demonstrate targeting of the ribosomal RNA to mimic the break with the goal of improving translation
accuracy and proteostasis. The proposed experiments will elucidate a novel mechanism underlying the ribosome
regulation of protein synthesis which can lead to greater cellular functions and resistances.

Project Summary / Abstract
Heterochromatin plays a crucial role in the repression of transposons, genome stability, and cell differentiation
through its ability to silence DNA transcription. How heterochromatin represses transcription by RNA polymerase
II (Pol II) is an open question. In Schizosaccharomyces pombe, histone three lysine 9 di- and tri-methyl (H3K9me)
bearing heterochromatic loci accomplish transcriptional silencing by recruiting the Heterochromatin Protein 1
(HP1) homologs Swi6 and Chp2. Together, HP1swi6/chp2 proteins induce chromatin compaction, recruit
downstream factors such as histone deacetylases (HDAC) and chromatin remodelers, and promote nascent
RNA decay. Previous studies have unraveled the mechanisms responsible for processing and degrading
nascent RNA transcripts. However, the mechanism(s) by which heterochromatin inhibits Pol II activity, referred
to as transcriptional gene silencing (TGS), is not fully understood. In the proposed work, I explore the following
questions: Which HP1swi6/chp2 functions are sufficient for TGS and what is the mechanism of HP1swi6/chp2 mediated
TGS? I hypothesize that HP1swi6/chp2 mediates TGS through distinct activities: intrinsic nonspecific DNA binding,
liquid-liquid phase separation formation, and the downstream recruitment of histone deacetylase and remodeling
activities. To test this hypothesis, I will 1) identify which Swi6 functions are necessary for heterochromatic TGS
using HP1swi6/chp2 mutant strains, 2) identify activities downstream of HP1swi6/chp2 that are sufficient for
heterochromatic TGS by direct recruitment of proteins to H3K9me loci in cells lacking recruitment of downstream
factors, and 3) Identify the specific transcriptional stage inhibited by HP1swi6/chp2 by characterizing the proteome
of heterochromatic and euchromatic ectopic locus. Achieving these aims would contribute to understanding the
mechanisms of gene regulation and transposon repression. In addition, mechanistic knowledge of
heterochromatic TGS could help treat diseases associated with heterochromatin defects.

Vectors derived from adeno-associated virus (AAV) have been clinically validated for gene therapy to treat ocular
diseases. This was showcased in 2017 by the FDA approval of Luxturna, an AAV2-based gene therapy to treat
an inherited form of blindness. Luxturna made history by becoming the first FDA-approved therapy to treat a
genetic disease. Despite its clinical success, intraocular inflammation and toxicity has been reported for Luxturna
and other AAV-based therapies for retinal disease. Gene expression data from the literature has demonstrated
that double-stranded (dsRNA)-responsive pathways, such as the RIG-I and MDA5 signaling pathways, are
upregulated upon subretinal and systemic administration of AAV gene therapy vectors in mice and non-human
primates. AAV vectors have also been previously documented to exhibit intrinsic promoter activity within the
inverted terminal repeats (ITRs), which can produce sense and antisense transcripts in transduced cells.
Unpublished data from our lab has shown a slight (but not statistically significant) alleviation of toxicity upon
subretinal injection of a toxic AAV into mice lacking functional MAVS (a dsRNA signaling adaptor) relative to
wild-type controls. Taken together, these data suggest that there may be a role for dsRNA sensing pathways in
mediating AAV ocular toxicity, which we hope to test directly using the experiments in Aim 1. We hypothesize
that ITR-directed sense and antisense transcripts in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) hybridize to
produce dsRNA, which activates cellular dsRNA sensors like RIG-I, MDA5, or others leading to ocular
toxicity. Because MAVS KO data did not produce full rescue of cone toxicity, nor did any other single innate or
adaptive KO strain tested, we hypothesize there are multiple pathways, immune or non-immune related,
contributing to toxicity. We will therefore perform an unbiased search for other pathways that could be
mediating toxicity in Aim 2 using a spatial transcriptomics approach developed in our lab, Light-Seq. Light-Seq
enables us to read out gene expression in user-defined regions of the same sample (e.g., AAV-transduced vs.
untransduced regions) without requiring cellular dissociation. I will use immunofluorescence (IF) and RNA
fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH, e.g., SABER-FISH or HCR-FISH) coupled with confocal imaging
throughout my proposal to confirm AAV tissue transduction, validate pathway hits, and quantify ocular toxicity.
Additionally, I will use genetic and pharmacologic perturbations to validate pathway candidates. Completion of
this proposal will expand our knowledge of antiviral responses to AAV vectors in the eye and may help guide
development of safer, more effective AAV ocular therapeutics. Additionally, insights gained in this proposal may
inform the development of safer AAV vectors delivered to other organs of therapeutic relevance.

Plasmodium falciparum is a pathogenic eukaryote in the phylum Apicomplexa with a complex life cycle that
alternates between Anopheles mosquitoes and humans. During the blood stages of the P. falciparum life cycle,
a single merozoite invades a human red blood cell (RBC). Over the course of 48 hours, the parasite multiplies
its genetic material and organelles via schizogony to form 20-36 merozoites. During infection, a small subset of
these parasites (~0.2-1.0%) commit and differentiate into transmissible male and female gametocytes via staged
process called gametocytogenesis. These two processes require elaborate, controlled cytoskeletal remodeling
to occur. The Plasmodium cytoskeleton comprises the pellicle, which includes the parasite plasma membrane
and a specialized organelle referred to as the inner membrane complex, and the subpellicular network that
constitutes microtubules and a family of intermediate filament-like proteins called alveolins. These structures
together serve to partition cytoplasmic contents during segmentation, confer cell shape and rigidity for daughter
merozoites and developing gametocytes, and provide essential structure support during gliding motility and RBC
invasion. We have recently discovered a novel Plasmodium cytoskeletal protein, PfFIG (Found In Gametocytes)
during our study the basal complex during blood stage P. falciparum infection. My preliminary data demonstrate
that PfFIG is important for asexual replication and is associated with microtubule dynamics in segmenting
schizonts and maturing gametocytes. We do not know, however, the functional role of PfFIG during the
Plasmodium blood stages of human malaria infection. Using inducible knockout (iKO) systems together with
super-resolution and cell viability assays, I will characterize the role of PfFIG (PF3D7_1435600) in P. falciparum
daughter cell segmentation and gametocyte maturation. This will elucidate its unique role in Plasmodium
microtubule dynamics, specifically as it contributes to cell shape and facilitates life stage transitions. Additionally,
I will perform immunoprecipitation and proximity-labeling experiments to map the PfFIG interactome, identifying
proteins of interest for future study and characterization. This research will broaden our understandings of the
core cellular machinery utilized by Plasmodium to carry out its unique life cycle. Specifically, study of
Plasmodium-specific cytoskeletal proteins and their role across parasite life stages will bring us closer to
targeting these proteins with antimalarial drugs.

Influenza remains a global health challenge. There is a pressing need for next-generation vaccines that can
protect against a broad range of influenza subtypes, particularly those of pandemic potential (e.g., H5, H7).
Hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) are two surface glycoproteins, which facilitate virion binding and
egress, respectively. While contemporary influenza vaccines are not standardized for NA, recent studies have
underscored the importance of NA-directed antibodies in influenza protection. However, relative to HA, the
immunodominance of NA and its evolutionary response to immune pressure remain largely uncharacterized.
Furthermore, whether an NA-based immunogen(s) can focus the humoral response to conserved sites on NA
has yet to be determined. The NA catalytic site (CS) cleaves sialic acid to enable viral egress and is conserved
amongst NA subtypes. Here, I hypothesize that structure-guided immunogen design can focus the immune
response to the conserved NA CS and augment anti-NA antibody breadth. To elicit a focused, CS-directed
immune response, I will pursue two approaches. 1) l will engineer glycans on the NA periphery to mask variable
epitopes, leaving the conserved CS exposed. 2) I will graft the conformationally complex CS onto antigenically
distinct scaffolds to enrich the CS epitope relative to other epitopes. To elicit broader anti-NA immunity and
augment CS-directed B cell activation, I will increase NA valency using protein linkers and nanoparticle platforms.
I will then test the effects of these NA immunogens in vivo and characterize the resulting serum, germinal center,
and memory B cell repertoires. I further hypothesize that focused anti-NA immunity will complement focused
anti-HA immunity to restrict influenza escape pathways. After passaging an influenza strain with anti-HA
antibodies, anti-NA antibodies, or both, I will characterize viral escape mutants and compare growth kinetics
relative to the wildtype strain. The data generated from this proposal will elucidate the effectiveness of the
proposed immune-focusing strategies as a general approach to vaccine design and particularly inform the
optimization of NA immunogens for next-generation influenza vaccines. These results will also advance our
understanding of NA antigenicity and evolvability.

We propose updating, piloting and testing a socialization and sex education curriculum (STEPS-2) designed
for adolescents and young adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities (I/DD). We will test this
updated curriculum in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) among 856 adolescents and young adults (aged 18-
27 years) with mild to moderate I/DD who receive services from disability providers in four of the five
Developmental Disabilities Regions of the New York State Office for People with Developmental Disabilities.
Randomization will be stratified by region, sex (male/female) and age (18-22, 23-27). Half of the participants
will be randomized to receive the updated STEPS-2 socialization and sex education curriculum in
individualized sessions during home visits, and the other half will receive a group-based intervention on
physical exercise and nutrition in a local community center; only one roommate will be eligible to be enrolled
from any group living arrangement to minimize spillover effects. Regional Coordinat ors will provide the 6-week
long interventions, with interview data collected at baseline (prior to intervention), month 2 (completion of
intervention), month 6 and month 12. We project completing recruitment into the RCT during the second
quarter of year 3, and completion of month 12 assessments in the third quarter of year 4. The primary outcome
will be proportion of participants reporting having had a conversation about sex/reproductive health with a
medical provider by month 12, with secondary outcomes including HPV vaccination status, receipt of sex and
age-specific preventive health screening, social sexual behaviors, agency over decisions, and, among those
sexually active, use of contraception (if not desiring a pregnancy), and use of sexually transmitted infection/HIV
protection. Interim measures will be used to assess knowledge and to reduce the likelihood of recall bias for
the primary endpoint.
Specifically, we aim to: (1) Update and pilot an existing socialization and sex education curriculum (STEPS-2)
for 18-27 year olds with I/DD in New York State through a participatory process centering the voices of diverse
lived experiences; (2) Test the efficacy of this socialization and sex education curriculum in a randomized
intervention trial using intention-to-treat and instrumental variable analyses to adjust for compliance. We
hypothesize that at least an additional 10% of the individuals in the experimental group will have had a
reproductive health discussion with a medical provider by month 12 compared with the control group; and (3)
Test whether the efficacy of the intervention differs by sex and age in stratified analyses. We have powered the
study for sex-specific efficacy estimates and will explore whether efficacy differs by age. The findings from this
translational study will inform practitioners, advocates, and self-advocates about best practices for reproductive
and sexual health education for adolescents and young adults with I/DD as they transition to adulthood.

Human exposure to toxic heavy metals existing in drinking water, food, and the environment is an area of
increasing national and international concern. Heavy metals are significant environmental pollutants because
they tend to persist, bioaccumulate and can result in serious adverse acute or chronic health effects after
ingested or inhaled. Traditionally, trace metals are measured from human tissues or fluids (blood or urine) in
centralized laboratories using complex analytical methods such as high-performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC) or inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS). However, in view of the intensive labor,
analytical costs and long turnaround times associated with centralized laboratory analyses, there is an immediate
need for a portable and inexpensive system for on-site monitoring of human exposure to heavy metals. These
rapid, field measurements of human exposure in the population would greatly help epidemiology researchers to
conduct their studies and also help the regulatory institutions with better determination of safety limits and
prevention of diseases caused by heavy metal exposures.
An important goal of this Direct to Phase II proposal is to develop a technology that meet the technical and
practical needs of environmental researchers, clinicians, and epidemiologists. The ultimate goal is to deliver a
reliable field prototype of a sensing instrument for the current unmet needs for rapid testing of trace amounts of
metals in urine samples, and to accelerate the commercialization of this product. In this Phase IIB study, Giner
will develop and demonstrate the heavy metals monitor prototype from bench-top assay platform to a field-ready
instrument with a portable size, with integrated components for assay operation, electronic units and software
packages for data processing and user interface. Meanwhile Giner will develop and fabricate a series of
disposable microfluidic lab-on-a-chip cartridge for convenient measurements of multiple metal(s) and metal
combinations from large numbers of human subjects. The various cartridge designs will allow the monitor
instrument to determine the presence and concentrations of multiple metals. The overall performances of the
prototype will then be evaluated thoroughly through a large scale of field testing with four renowned epidemiology
collaborators, as well as a team of user experience specialists, which would improve the sensing capabilities,
tool reliability and usability towards commercialization.
This proposed project will achieve a critical step towards the commercial release of a heavy metal field monitor,
which has the potential to become a critical tool to support environmental and public health community for
developing strategies to prevent toxic metals-related diseases. Giner is teaming up with leading commercial
partners which specialize in the development and commercialization of screening and diagnostic technologies.

Opioid use disorder (OUD) contributes to disability, loss of work, and over 100,000 overdose deaths per year
in the U.S., emphasizing the critical need for novel medications for OUD treatment. Ibogaine, a
psychoactive alkaloid from the Tabernanthe iboga shrub, has shown promise in interrupting opioid
dependence, reducing withdrawal symptoms, and increasing abstinence rates, even after a single
treatment. However, ibogaine's cardiotoxicity and neurotoxicity pose significant barriers to its development
as a drug. To leverage ibogaine’s potential as an OUD therapeutic and address the risks to patient safety,
we have developed a new class of synthetic iboga alkaloids, named “oxa-iboga”. These compounds show no
pro-arrhythmic potential, no neurotoxic effects, and enhanced efficacy in OUD-relevant preclinical behavioral
assays compared to ibogaine. We propose to advance one of these compounds, GM-3009, into clinical
studies by advancing GMP-manufacturing and formulation of GM-3009, completing IND-enabling toxicity
studies, and determining the expected therapeutic exposures of GM-3009 and target engagement via
translational biomarkers. These studies will complete the UG3 portion of this grant. If successful, the
proposal will advance to the UH3 portion, which will conduct first-in-human trials, including safety and
tolerability studies in healthy volunteers (a single ascending dose study, SAD) and a safety study with
exploratory measures of efficacy in OUD patients undergoing opioid withdrawal. The endpoint of the entire
project is generation of clinical safety and preliminary efficacy data to support subsequent Phase 2 efficacy
studies in OUD. The development of GM-3009 builds on decades of research on ibogaine and has the potential
to deliver an innovative OUD therapy with rapid and long-term mitigation of acute and protracted withdrawal
symptoms and cravings, which lead to non-medical opioid use.

The clinical studies demonstrating that when people maintain undetectable levels of viral loads, HIV cannot
transmit provided an exciting new direction for HIV management. A central part of HIV health care will be to
develop the technology required for home testing of HIV viral loads similar to diabetes management. There are
several requirements for such a home test. First, sample preparation of virus must cleanly isolate virus-laden
plasma without lysing white blood cells or require any lab equipment. Second, the test must store reagents on-
chip at ambient conditions over long periods. Third, the test must provide accurate and ideally, semi-quantitative
information without requiring extensive manipulation, training, or expensive instrumentation. Current diagnostics
cannot meet these requirements. The highest value test is nucleic acid amplification but the enzymes and buffers
require cold chain storage, trained personnel, and frequently, fluorescence-based instrumentation. Antibody-
based tests for viral capture on lateral flow are hampered by lower analytical sensitivity and specificity values,
are not quantitative, and are hampered by protein rather than nucleic acid-based manufacturing infrastructures.
Here we propose the integration of our novel biogel nanosensors and boron-doped diamond microelectrode
arrays to directly provide actionable, semi-quantitative, HIV viral load information for the home user. Our hydrogel
encapsulates and locks in NAAT tests in aqueous environments without oil or manufacturing additional
compartments. The gel provides safe, on-chip storage of reagents and critically, is printable for rapid fabrication
of arrays for digital quantitation. The gel is also specifically positively charged to attract and concentrate viral
genomes from the raw sample which would improve the LOD95. In our proposed platform, a boron-doped
diamond microelectrode underlies each spot in the array. This will provide an individual, electrochemical readout
for every spot which can be interpreted in a digital format for potential quantification. With this platform, the user
simply adds blood from a fingerstick and uses a membrane to separate out the plasma. A second wicking
membrane with lysis reagents delivers viral genomes to the biogel nanosensor array via lateral flow. Together,
the ease of use, on-chip storage, creation of a digital electrochemical readout, and compatibility with
manufacturing infrastructures to keep costs low yields a promising, viable platform for HIV management at home.

Sex-hormone fluctuations across the ovarian cycle exert powerful effects on female brain and behavior, and are
likely contributors to female-specific risks for neuropsychiatric conditions. This is exemplified by anxiety and
depression, disorders twice as prevalent in women of reproductive age compared to their male counterparts.
However, the mechanisms underlying the dynamic nature of the female brain remain poorly understood, limiting
our ability to design sex-specific treatments for female-biased disorders. The goal of our research is to address
this critical need, and to reveal the molecular mechanisms through which sex hormones dynamically impact
female brain structure and behavior. To this end, we recently made the important discovery that chromatin
organization, a major epigenetic mechanism controlling gene expression, is highly dynamic in the female ventral
hippocampus (vHIP) of mouse, as a function of the estrous cycle stage. We linked these chromatin dynamics to
changes in neuronal gene expression and to variation in vHIP-dependent, anxiety-related behaviors in mice.
Based on these findings, we hypothesize that rhythmic sex-hormone changes induce extensive chromatin re-
organization in vHIP neurons across the ovarian cycle, resulting in cyclic changes in gene activity and
contributing to increased female vulnerability to anxiety-related phenotypes associated with the varying estrogen
state. To address this hypothesis, we designed the current study with three independent aims to reveal estrous
cycle- and sex-specific epigenetic gene regulation in vHIP neurons in mice, and to provide a mechanistic link
between vHIP chromatin dynamics and anxiety-related behavior. In Aim 1, we will use cutting-edge epigenomics
methods to identify estrous cycle- and sex-specific cis-regulatory elements and chromatin mechanisms driving
transcriptional programs in vHIP neurons. In Aim 2, we will use a single-cell transcriptomic analysis and RNA in
situ hybridization to reveal vHIP neuronal clusters that are transcriptionally responsive to cycling hormones and
possible drivers of cyclic changes in chromatin and behavior. In Aim 3, we will genetically manipulate a candidate
epigenetic regulator identified by bioinformatics approaches, to identify a functional role of these sex-specific
chromatin dynamics in gene regulation and anxiety-related behavior. Overall, these studies will reveal chromatin-
dependent molecular mechanisms controlling neuronal gene expression and anxiety-related behavior across the
estrous cycle. These findings will provide a necessary first step to identify candidate, sex-specific targets for the
treatment of female-biased disorders such as anxiety and depression.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Emerging adulthood represents a uniquely sensitive period for studying social determinants of health in the
United States (US), as young people begin to establish their own paths towards higher education, careers, and
financial independence. College, specifically, is a time of changing socioeconomic position (SEP) that is not
often clearly captured in health research, despite strong ties between SEP and health. Over 40% of all young
adults aged 18-24 are enrolled as full-time college students in the US, and they increasingly represent the
diversity of the country in terms of SEP, race, and ethnicity, particularly colleges classified as Hispanic-Serving
Institutions (HSIs). (The 539 HSIs in the US serve over two-thirds of all Latinx, 40% of all Asian, and 22% of all
Black college students in the US.) Despite perceptions that emerging adult college students are at the peak of
health, over one-third of college students report being overweight or obese, and the incidence of
cardiovascular disease outcomes among young adults has been an increasing cause of concern. This risk is
exacerbated for low-SEP students, and students of color, especially since the COVID-19 pandemic began.
Therefore, emerging adult college students are a priority population to promote cardiovascular health, and
reduce health disparities, before the onset of chronic disease. The proposed longitudinal research addresses
these important scientific gaps by creating and studying a de novo, longitudinal cohort of 4,000 racially,
ethnically, and socioeconomically diverse young adult college students recruited as first-year students from two
HSIs in California and followed over three years, including if they leave college. The study will incorporate
anthropometric, institutional administrative, smartphone, behavioral, and self-reported data. The specific aims
are: (1) To determine the contribution of emerging adults’ economic stressors (e.g.,income, wealth, financial
stress, basic needs, residential environment, subjective social status) to cardiometabolic health outcomes
(e.g., weight-related measures, blood pressure) over time; (2) To determine the contribution of educational
protective factors (e.g., use of social supports, academic supports, basic needs supports) to cardiometabolic
health outcomes over time; (3) examine weight-related behaviors (i.e., sleep, physical activity, diet, disordered
eating, smoking) as mechanisms of associations between economic stress, educational protective factors, and
cardiometabolic health. This large, diverse sample will have sufficient statistical power to examine how
racialized and gendered identities may modify associations between economic and educational exposures and
cardiometabolic outcomes, which will help increase understanding of the complex interplay between different
social determinants of health and help inform potential interventions to reduce health disparities. Identifying risk
and protective factors that could affect weight and blood pressure among diverse emerging adult college
students can help inform novel interventions and support services to promote cardiometabolic health in a
significant portion of the young adult population.

Single cell genomics has become an essential tool to explore cellular heterogeneity, understand what makes
cells different from each other or in their response to disease and search for cells with valuable therapeutic
properties. Despite tremendous advances in the technologies enabling single cell analysis, combining
sequencing based genomic analysis and more traditional imaging-based cellular assays remains a challenge.
Many projects require to combine several technologies to collect both phenotyping and genotyping information,
making experimental design and execution as well as result interpretation challenging. To overcome these
limitations and allow the direct measurement and correlation of a cell’s phenotype, physiological conditions and
molecular signatures, Flexomics is developing the next generation of cell analysis platform combining imaging
and sequencing-based readouts. Our proprietary platform uses a high-density picowell array specifically
designed for single cell isolation and fluorescent imaging of the captured cells combined with a unique high-
throughput nucleic-acid barcoding system that can be deciphered both by fluorescence microscopy and by
sequencing. This approach allows us to implement gold-standard image-based functional assays to measure
and correlate live cell responses and sequencing data for 100,000s individual cells in parallel. Building on our
promising feasibility result, we propose to demonstrate the flexibility, deployability and commercial potential of
our platform by: (1) demonstrating the ability of our platform to select for cells with specific phenotypes to be
enriched for sequencing analysis, (2) building the required data processing, visualization tools and user interface
combining imaging and sequencing data necessary for the deployment of our platform, (3) generating proof of
concept data at a customer site on complex heterogeneous clinical sample. At the end of this Phase II grant, we
will be ideally positioned to expand our beta testing program to additional customers and engage with strategic
partners and investors to drive the adoption of our platform.

Ovarian hormone fluctuations critically shape the brain and behavior and represent a major contributor to female
specific risks for neuropsychiatric disorders including depression and anxiety disorders. Another female-specific
factor is a double dose of the X chromosome, one of which is typically “inactivated” during development and
stays in a repressed form in somatic female cells including neurons. A subset of genes called “X escapees” are
able to escape this inactivation and contribute to sex-specific gene expression across tissues including the brain.
While some cell-, tissue-, and species-specific escapees have been described, “dynamic X escapees” are
unknown. However, in our recent study, we described putative “estrous cycle-dependent X escapees” associated
with substantial dynamism in 3D genome structure of the X chromosome across the mouse estrous cycle.
Intriguingly, we have a strong indication that the volume of the inactive X chromosome (Xi) changes in response
to fluctuating ovarian hormones. We hypothesize that Xi undergoes conformational changes in neurons across
the ovarian cycle, which can alter both X-linked and autosomal gene expression and contribute to behavioral
adaptation in response to reproductive hormone changes. In this project, we will perform two independent aims
to test our hypothesis, by studying the estrous cycle effects in two mouse genetic models. In Aim 1, we will use
the ΔXist mutant mice that will allow us to perform allele-specific genomics analyses and distinguish between
active (Xa) and inactive (Xi) X chromosomes and confirm hormone-induced Xi plasticity. In Aim 2, we will use
the 39,XO female mice that lack the inactive X chromosome and will allow us to assess the functional role of Xi
and its dynamics in gene regulation and behavior. In both aims, we will use cutting-edge, neuron-specific
genomics assays to characterize gene expression (RNA-seq) and 3D genome organization (Hi-C) in ventral
hippocampal neurons across the estrous cycle. We will also test anxiety-related behavior in XO mice and
compare it to XX and XY counterparts, to determine whether the inactive X chromosome interacts with the
estrous cycle to regulate behavior. Our findings can provide radically novel insights into sex-specific brain
regulation, opening new avenues for sex-and gender-informed treatments of brain disorders, with critical
implications for women’s mental health.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
The Cardiothoracic Surgical Trials Network (CTSN) has made significant contributions in advancing the
evidence base for cardiothoracic surgery. As the population ages and the incidence of cardiovascular disease
remains high, there is an important public health need to expand the capacity of the CTSN. Northern New
England (NNE) is home to the most rural and elderly population in the US. Individuals living in NNE are
medically underserved and face significant socioeconomic challenges. These conditions occur in the context of
higher rates of comorbid conditions, leading to a high cardiovascular disease burden and lower life expectancy.
Importantly, rural patients are underrepresented in cardiovascular clinical trials.
As hospitals located in NNE, Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center (DHMC) and Maine Medical Center (MMC)
share a common goal of improving the health of rural communities. Specific aims are: (1) to expand the
capacity of the CTSN in rural populations with high cardiovascular disease burden and develop strategies for
implementing trial findings in such patients; (2) to support the development and clinical research capacity at
MMC; and (3) to train the next generation of implementation science researchers through the Clinical and
Implementation Research Skills Program (CIRSP). Several unique features of this collaboration will allow
achievement of these aims. First, DHMC and MMC are the major referral centers for cardiac surgery in NNE,
ensuring an ideal setting for recruiting patients with a high cardiovascular disease burden. Second, DHMC is
an international leader in the use of regional and national registries to facilitate population-based research.
DHMC is the data coordinating center for Northern New England Cardiovascular Disease Study Group
(NNECDSG) which collects data on 90% of cardiac surgery in NNE. DHMC also maintains the largest non-
federal repository of Medicare data in the US through the Dartmouth Atlas. Third, Dr. Iribarne has 11 years of
experience with the CTSN and brings significant knowledge of lessons learned on optimal recruitment
strategies for enrolling cardiac surgery patients. Fourth, DHMC and MMC have worked collaboratively in
quality improvement since 1987 through the NNECDSG; the Linked Clinical Research Center (LCRC) program
is a natural extension of this collaboration. Fifth, a group of nationally recognized experts in implementation
science has been assembled to educate CIRSP Scholars in late-stage implementation research.
The expected results are that: (1) the capacity of the CTSN will expand into rural populations with high
cardiovascular disease burden; (2) implementation science will be integrated in future CTSN research; (3)
MMC will be a leading enroller in CTSN trials; and (4) early career investigators will be trained in and perform
late-stage implementation research using the CTSN infrastructure. These results will support the mission of the
LCRC program in expanding the capacity of cardiothoracic surgery research in areas of need.

The Hispanic population in the US is about 60.5 million and comprise 18% of the total US population.
Unfortunately, there number of Hispanic/Latinx Psychiatrists, Psychologists and Social Workers is significantly
less in proportion to non-Hispanic practitioners, with Hispanic physicians representing only 7% of the total
physician workforce. In the mental health field, Hispanic psychiatrists represent 5.8% of the psychiatrist
workforce, whereas Hispanic psychologist represent 5% and Hispanic social workers 14% of their
corresponding workforce. Numbers are similar in the research workforce with only 6% of all NIH funds being
awarded to Hispanic investigators. To mitigate this underrepresentation of Hispanic/Latinx investigators
interested in mental health, we propose to partner with the American Society of Hispanic Psychiatry (ASHP) to
enhance their annual meeting with a personalized and highly focused mentoring program. This mentoring
program will take place annually over one and a half days, in which 12 junior Hispanic/Latinx investigators will
be competitively selected out of a larger pool of applicants and invited to present their work. Mentor-mentee
pairs will be formed based on the area of interest, the type of research being done, and the expertise of the
mentor. In addition, several other didactic activities will take place during the program, including a keynote
lecture, a grant writing workshop, a poster session, and a series of lunch tables for networking as well as to
discuss topics relevant to junior investigators. At the end of the meeting, mentor-mentee pairs will determine
career goals for the mentee and will meet virtually every 6 months to discuss the progress of agreed goals and
to discuss any changes in career trajectory. The specific aims of the program are: 1): To identify 12 junior
Hispanic/Latinx investigators interested in mental health research every year and provide them financial
support to attend and present at the ASHP annual meeting; 2) To engage 12 Hispanic/Latinx investigators
every year in mentorship activities during the ASHP conference; 3) To follow up on the outcome of the junior
Hispanic/Latinx investigators in metrics such as peer-reviewed publications, NIH and other agencies grant
support, scientific presentations, and academic advancement; 4) To develop a network of Hispanic/Latinx
mentors and mentees to support the academic advancement of the mentees. We believe that a highly focused
and personalized mentoring program in the context of the ASHP annual meeting will be a great strategy to train
and mentor rising Hispanic/Latinx investigators. We have assembled a group of prominent Hispanic/Latinx
investigators and mentors in the fields of Psychiatry, Psychology, and Social Work, who will not only provide
the best mentorship experience but also serve as role models for junior Hispanic/Latinx investigators.
Therefore, we are confident that this mentoring program will help increase the representation of
Hispanic/Latinx investigators in the workforce.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Abstract. Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a potentially life-threatening autosomal dominant disorder
characterized by recurrent swelling of cutaneous tissues, gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts. Almost all
cases are caused by deficiency in plasma C1-esterase inhibitor (C1EI, a serine protease inhibitor coded
by SERPING1 which functions to regulate the contact, complement and fibrinolytic systems. The
deficiency of C1EI leads to uncontrolled, spontaneous activation of C1 and consumption of C2 and C4,
resulting in increased levels of bradykinin which promotes vascular leak. Our focus is to restore functional
levels of C1 esterase inhibitor by providing a copy of the human C1EI cDNA by gene therapy. ENYX
Therapeutics, an early-stage biotechnology company, is collaborating with the R. Crystal laboratory at
Weill Cornell to develop adeno-associated (AAV)-mediated gene therapy for HAE. In a murine model of
C1EI deficiency, one-time administration of an AAVrh.10 gene transfer vector expressing human C1EI
(AAVrh.10hC1EI, ENX05) provides sustained C1EI activity levels in plasma, sufficient to prevent
angioedema episodes. AAVrh10.hC1EI-treated mice displayed a marked decrease in dye extravasation in
paws and organs, compared with untreated littermates, i.e., a single treatment with ENX05 has the
potential to provide long-term protection from angioedema attacks. The goal of this phase 1 STTR is the
next step in translation of this therapy to humans: demonstration of the safety of the therapy. As detailed in
the proposal, C1EI deficient mice were corrected with an ENX05 dose of 4x1012 gc/kg, a dose for which
prior studies have shown that the AAVrh.10 capsid should not pose a safety risk. However, there is the
theoretical risk that overexpression of C1EI could evoke dysfunction of the complement system. We will
test this in nonhuman primates. Specific aim 1. To assess the hypothesis that overexpression of
ENYX05 (AAVrh.10hC1EI) will not cause dysfunction of the complement system. We will assess the
complement system (serum CH50, AH50, C3, C4) and other safety parameters in male and female
nonhuman primates (NHP) following high dose (1013 gc/kg) intravenous administration of ENX05 (to
assess ENX05 administration without preexisting anti-AAVrh.10 immunity) and then in the same NHP over
the next 6 wk following a 2nd high dose (1013 gc/kg) intravenous administration of ENX05 (to assess
ENX05 administration in the context of existing anti-AAVrh.10 immunity). Controls will include nonhuman
primates treated with AAVrh.10Null, a vector identical to ENX05 but without the human C1EI coding
sequence. At the end of the study, all major organs will be assessed at the histologic level. With this study,
assuming there is no observed dysfunction in the complement system evoked by ENX05, we will have
eliminated an important theoretical safety issue in the translation of ENX05 to the clinic.

Postpartum depression is one of the most common complications of childbirth. Untreated postpartum depression
can have substantial adverse effects on the well-being of the mother and child, negatively impacting child cog-
nitive, behavioral, and emotional development with lasting consequences. The underlying pathophysiology of
postpartum depression is largely unknown, creating an obstacle to developing improved treatments. The overall
goal of this study is to determine the relationships between GABAergic and glutamatergic neuroactive steroids,
cortical GABA and GLU concentrations and default mode network resting-state functional connectivity in women
with postpartum depression versus healthy postpartum and non-postpartum women. Our central hypothesis is
that high sustained amplitude neuroactive steroid exposure then withdrawal during the pregnancy and the post-
partum period versus the low brief amplitude neuroactive steroid exposure/withdrawal of the menstrual cycle, is
associated with differential cortical GABA and GLU concentrations within the default mode network and their
correlation to network resting state functional connectivity, with further differences between women with and
without postpartum depression. This study is a prospective observational study of 54 healthy peripartum comparison
women and 54 peripartum women with postpartum depression in comparison to a cross-sectional examination of 54
healthy women in the follicular stage of the menstrual cycle. Peripartum mood data and blood specimens will be ob-
tained at 2 antepartum and 2 postpartum study visits. Healthy postpartum comparison women and women with post-
partum depression will undergo a single functional MRI and magnetic resonance spectroscopy scan in the postpartum
period while healthy women in the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle will complete a single study visit including
mood, blood and neuroimaging measures. The study will examine differences in default mode resting state functional
connectivity across groups (Aim 1), differences in GABA and glutamate concentrations across groups (Aim 2), corre-
lations between spectroscopy and resting-state functional connectivity (Aim 3) and explore correlations of spectros-
copy, resting-state functional connectivity, neuroactive steroids and depression in postpartum depression (Exploratory
Aim 1). Finally, half of the women with postpartum depression will complete a second imaging session after successful
postpartum depression treatment (Exploratory Aim 2) to determine GABA, glutamate and resting-state functional con-
nectivity changes associated with treatment. This data can then serve as an objective index against which to predict
response to current pharmacotherapies, identify new postpartum-specific therapeutic targets and measure po-
tential efficacy of newly developed treatments.

Children with proteinuric glomerulopathies are at considerable risk for cardiovascular disease. In addition to the
high prevalence of traditional cardiovascular disease risk factors in this population, more than half of children
with proteinuric glomerulopathies experience nocturnal blood pressure dysregulation, defined by nocturnal
hypertension or a reduced decline in nocturnal blood pressure (non-dipping pattern). Nocturnal blood pressure
dysregulation is independently associated with poor cardiovascular disease outcomes in adults. In this context,
the objective of this proposal is to understand the cardiovascular disease risks, clinical predictors and molecular
markers associated with nocturnal blood pressure dysregulation in children with proteinuric glomerulopathies.
The central hypothesis is that nocturnal blood pressure dysregulation is independently associated with
progression of cardiovascular target organ damage over time in children with proteinuric glomerulopathies. It is
further hypothesized that clinical and molecular markers will be associated with the nocturnal blood pressure
dysregulation phenotype. The specific aims of this proposal are: (Aim 1) To determine how nocturnal blood
pressure dysregulation associates with target organ damage over time in children with proteinuric
glomerulopathies; (Aim 2) To identify sleep- and circadian-related predictors of nocturnal blood pressure
dysregulation in children with proteinuric glomerulopathies; (Aim 3) To investigate molecular pathways, networks
and metabolic alterations associated with nocturnal blood pressure dysregulation in children with proteinuric
glomerulopathies using multi-omic data integration
. The proposed study will investigate nocturnal blood pressure
dysregulation in a multi-center, longitudinal observational study of 120 children with proteinuric glomerulopathies
enrolled from the Nephrotic Syndrome Study Network (NEPTUNE) and Cure Glomerulonephropathy Network
(CureGN). Cardiovascular measures will be followed for three years to determine how the nocturnal BP
dysregulation phenotype associates with progression of cardiovascular target organ damage. Predictive models
will then be developed using machine learning methods to identify the clinical predictors of nocturnal blood
pressure dysregulation, with a particular emphasis on sleep- and circadian-related predictors. Further, a
precision medicine approach will be employed to define molecular markers of nocturnal blood pressure
dysregulation using multi-omic data (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics) integration. To this
end, identifying the health risks, clinical predictors and molecular markers associated with nocturnal blood
pressure dysregulation among children with proteinuric glomerulopathies using innovative bioinformatics
approaches to analyze existing and novel data will fill a significant knowledge gap for a population of children at
great cardiovascular risk. This study will ultimately guide prevention and treatment to meaningfully improve
cardiovascular disease outcomes in these children with proteinuric glomerulopathies.

frequently followed by infection and sepsis. As a result, many patients suffering from HS or HS+sepsis
develop acute lung injury (ALI), a life-threatening complication. We have previously discovered that eCIRP,
a new DAMP, released after HS or sepsis worsens disease severity and lethality. Our preliminary studies
have confirmed elevated levels of eCIRP in the circulation of patients and animals after HS, as well as in the
supernatant of macrophages exposed to hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R). We have also shown that H/R or
endotoxin promotes gasdermin D (GSDMD) cleavage into pore-forming subunits. The release of eCIRP
after endotoxin was decreased by a GSDMD pore formation inhibitor and in cells from GSDMD knockout
mice, implicating an important role of GSDMD in eCIRP’s active release. We have demonstrated that
eCIRP activates stimulator of interferon genes (STING) in vitro and in vivo, leading to the upregulation and
release of type I interferons (IFNs). Furthermore, we have shown that STING activation is critical to the
development of systemic inflammation, tissue injury, ALI, and mortality after HS. We have also
demonstrated that eCIRP promotes mitochondrial (mt) DNA fragmentation, thus providing a plausible
mechanism for how eCIRP activates STING. In addition, we have shown for the first time that type I IFNs
play a pivotal role in the development of ALI after HS. Based on these novel findings, we hypothesize that
eCIRP, released through GSDMD pores, activates STING via fragmented mtDNA and increases the release
of type I IFNs, ultimately leading to ALI and death after HS or HS+sepsis. Moreover, we have predicted in
silico and confirmed in vitro that our newly discovered RNA mimic A12 binds to eCIRP with high affinity, in-
hibiting eCIRP’s ability to induce TNFα release from macrophages. A12 had a long half-life in the circulation
and reduced inflammation and tissue injury after HS. Therefore, we further hypothesize that eCIRP
inhibition with A12 attenuates ALI and mortality in mice subjected to HS or HS+sepsis. In this project, we
plan to establish the role of GSDMD pore formation on the active release of eCIRP, determine the detailed
mechanism by which eCIRP activates STING, and examine the beneficial effects of the novel eCIRP
inhibitor A12 on ALI and survival after HS or HS+sepsis. These studies shall provide novel mechanistic
insights into the pathogenesis of ALI and organ injury after HS or HS complicated by sepsis, as well as a
new potential therapeutic strategy to treat patients under those conditions.

 Lupus nephritis (LN) is a common manifestation of systemic lupus erythematosus that can lead to
irreversible renal impairment. Current immunosuppressive therapies fail to reverse disease in more than half of
treated patients and only 2 new drugs have been approved treatment, both of which confer only modest
improvement. Renal myeloid cells are involved in renal injury in LN, both in humans and animal models.
Macrophages are highly plastic and can mediate both pro-inflammatory and reparative functions. Because
there are so many subsets of myeloid cells and some of them change their function over time, analysis of
single cells is crucial to the study of these cells. Initial studies in Phase 1 and early Phase 2 of the
Accelerating Medicines Partnerships-SLE (AMP-SLE), of which we are all members, have shown that there are
multiple subsets of macrophages in LN kidneys that are analogous to myeloid subsets in mice but the function
of these subsets and whether they are pathogenic, or protective is still not known. Study of kidney tissues in
LN patients is hampered by the small size of the kidney biopsy and the infrequency of these biopsies in
individual patients over the course of their disease. Therefore, animal models, when carefully and rigorously
employed, are especially useful for addressing hypotheses generated by examining human data.
 Our overall hypothesis is that we will identify human-relevant myeloid cell subsets in LN models that
reflect differences in disease pathophysiology, disease stage and responsiveness to treatments and that this
information will help identify new pathways for therapeutic intervention and direct personalized treatment. Our
approach is focused on identifying and testing the function of human-relevant cell subsets and pathways in
vitro and under physiologic conditions in vivo. In Aim 1 we will complete the integration of single cell RNASeq
analysis of myeloid cells from 5 different models of LN with that from AMP-SLE Phase 2 to map both shared
and unique macrophage sub-populations. We will follow the fate of peripheral myeloid cells as they transition
from the blood into the kidneys to define how the nephritis-specific profile of each subset and how they are
related to each other. We will then determine whether there is a particular myeloid cell profile that is associated
with response or non-response of LN patients to standard of care therapy. In Aim 2 we will determine how
renal myeloid cells interact with renal stromal cells both in vitro and in vivo. We will analyze the fate of renal
myeloid cells (in responder and non-responder mice) in human-relevant mouse models treated with remission
induction therapies to identify reparative subsets and pathways. Our focus here will be on both standard of
care therapy and on belimumab (anti-BAFF) since this is the only biologic drug so far approved for treatment of
LN and for prevention of further renal flares. In Aim 3 we will use CRISPR libraries for in vivo targeting of 13
transcription factors we have identified in preliminary studies to screen for new therapeutic approaches to
protect LN kidneys from disease progression, fibrosis, and end stage renal disease.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Survival and growth of cancer cells depend on environmental cues delivered by cell contact and soluble factors.
These shape disease biology and aggressiveness, reflected by the effectiveness of therapeutic regimens in
blocking trophic inputs. This principle is exemplified in the relatively common and still incurable chronic
lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), a disease of clonal CD5+ B cells requiring ongoing signaling from membrane
receptors and cells within the tumor microenvironment. While considerable information has been gleaned about
the bi-directional dialogue between CLL B cells and autologous T cells, little information is available about
individual T-cell subsets, particularly Th17 cells, a unique subset of T helper cells. The scientific premise of
this proposal comes from our findings that in CLL: [1] higher levels of Th17-related cytokines and numbers of
circulating Th17 cells associate with better clinical outcomes; [2] leukemic B cells promote Th17 generation from
autologous CD4 T cells in vitro; [3] expression of miR155, which promotes Th17 cell differentiation, is significantly
higher in Th17 cells from CLL patients than in healthy subjects; [4] Th17 cells modulate CLL B-cell survival and
growth in vitro and in vivo; and [5] treatment of naïve CLL T cells from CLL patients with the PI3K inhibitor
idelalisib, significantly enhances Th17-cell generation. These findings underlie our central hypothesis that CLL
B cells promote the generation of Th17 cells, which exert anti-tumor effects within the leukemic compartment.
We expect that enhancing idelalisib's ability to positively affect Th17 generation and function will significantly
improve its clinical value. Our long-range goal is to define this cellular bi-directional communication more clearly
at the molecular level, so as to manipulate these interactions to therapeutic advantage. To advance our
hypotheses and goal, we propose studies to: elucidate cellular and molecular mechanism(s) whereby leukemic
B cells regulate Th17 cell generation in CLL, focusing on the STAT3/miR155 pathway (Aim 1); determine the
influence of Th17 cells on leukemic B-cell survival, growth and maturation in vitro and in vivo (Aim 2) and
investigate the effects of idelalisib on Th17-cell generation and function in CLL (Aim 3). The proposed work is
innovative as it is the first to explore underlying mechanisms by which leukemic B cells regulate the generation
and function of Th17 cells and the impact this regulation has on clinical outcome; it is also the first study of
genome-wide miR expression in T cells from CLL patients. Also, these innovative studies will have considerable
impact on CLL, since we will identify mechanisms generating Th17s in CLL and the impact this T-cell subset has
on leukemic B cell growth, proliferation and maturation. Finally, we will determine if lower Th17-cell numbers in
CLL patients with poor outcomes results from inherent differences in the CLL T or B cells. This will serve to better
inform future studies on how to enhance Th17 responses in CLL as a therapeutic modality achieved by targeted
drug therapy or adoptive immunotherapy.

Sepsis is now the leading cause of death in US hospitals and there are currently no effective
pharmacological treatments for sepsis. Stromal cell-based therapies have shown efficacy in treating sepsis
in experimental models and have been approved for use in multiple countries for various immune
dysregulation diseases. Fibroblastic reticular cells (FRCs) are a subpopulation of stromal cells existing in all
lymphoid organs including fat associated lymphoid cluster (FALC) in adipose tissue. We have shown that
TLR9 signaling suppresses chemokine production in FRCs. Adoptive transfer of Tlr9-deficient FRCs
decreased mortality, bacterial load, and systemic inflammation compared with wild type (WT) FRCs after
cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). Here, we identified two distinct subsets of FRCs (Ly6Chi and Ly6Clo) in
mesenteric FALCs at baseline and after CLP. Importantly, the Ly6Chi FRC subset express similar top
marker genes as the CD55+ stromal cell subset that was previously described in both mouse and human
subcutaneous adipose tissue. Ly6Chi FRCs are enriched in the innate immune response-related genes after
CLP, whereas Ly6Clo FRCs are enriched in the humoral immune response-related genes. Furthermore, we
found that both Ly6Chi and Ly6Clo FRCs from Tlr9-/- mice increased gene expression associated with
inflammation, proliferation, and extracellular matrix remodeling compared with WT FRCs at baseline and
after CLP. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that TLR9 plays critical roles in regulating the biology of
distinct FRC subsets, and that modulation of TLR9 signaling in a subset-specific manner may improve the
efficacy of FRC-based therapy in sepsis. We will test our hypothesis by pursuing two specific aims: Aim 1:
To determine the mechanisms of TLR9-mediated regulation of FRC biology in mouse and human adipose
FRC subsets. We will take advantage of single cell technologies (single cell RNA-sequencing and Mass
cytometry) combined with the FRC-specific Tlr9-/- mice to determine the role of TLR9 in gene expression,
cell fate, and immunoregulatory functions in individual FRC subset in vivo and in vitro. We will also validate
the findings from mouse FRCs in human adipose FRCs. Aim 2: To determine the impact of TLR9 inhibition
preconditioning on FRC therapy in intra-abdominal sepsis. We will determine the therapeutic efficacy of
TLR9 inhibition preconditioned FRC subsets in two clinically relevant intra-abdominal sepsis models: (1)
CLP-induced polymicrobial peritonitis; and (2) intra-abdominal infection of a human strain of Escherichia
coli. We will also use an LPS-induced peritonitis model to determine the mechanisms underlying the
beneficial effects of FRC-based therapy and the impact of TLR9 on individual FRC subset therapies. Our
study will advance understanding of the diversity and biology of FRC subsets as well as the regulation of
TLR9 in these distinct subsets, which will discover new strategies to modify selective FRC subsets to
improve efficacy of FRC-based therapy for sepsis and other immune dysregulation diseases.

The overarching objective of the proposed mentored patient-oriented career development award (K23) is to
develop an acute kidney injury (AKI) research program that utilizes behavioral science principles and digital
health solutions, fostering Dr. Ng’s development to an independent researcher.
AKI, a sudden decline in kidney function, occurs in 16-25% of hospitalized patients. If AKI is not addressed
during the transition of care from the hospital to outpatient setting, patients are at risk for recurrent AKI and
rehospitalization. Achieving optimal transition of care for AKI is challenging, because AKI information is poorly
communicated both to outpatient providers and patients. Outpatient providers cannot address AKI
complications nor monitor kidney function, when they are unaware of patient’s AKI status. Additionally, patients
lack the knowledge and self-management skills for AKI (e.g., follow kidney-specific dietary restrictions or avoid
medications harmful to the kidneys). To improve AKI information flow to providers and patients, the candidate
proposes to adapt and evaluate: 1) an AKI section for discharge summary; and 2) the feasibility of a text
messages to support patient education and self-management. The Specific Aims are: 1a) adapt existing
discharge summary to include AKI information, and test usability; 1b) design and adapt text messages for an
AKI management and education tool (AKI-MET); and 2) evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary
efficacy of intervention components in a 2 sequential pilot RCTs.
Dr Ng has completed a master’s degree in clinical epidemiology at the University of Pennsylvania, through
which she gained experience in epidemiology, biostatistics, and study design. Her previous training and
experience in AKI epidemiology research and qualitative research have prepared her to engage in the work
proposed in the studies. Dr Ng is positioned to use this award to launch an independent research career in the
rich research and training environment at the Zucker School of Medicine at Hofstra/Northwell. Through her
proposed career development, she seeks to gain skills in: 1) application of health information technology and
digital health intervention; 2) behavioral science and behavioral intervention design; 3) RCT design, conduct,
and analysis, including longitudinal data analysis from the pilot trial; and 4) professional development. Dr. Ng
has assembled a multi-disciplinary mentorship team led by experts in the field. Upon completion of these K23
activities, she will be well-positioned to submit an R01 for a larger RCT to assess the effectiveness of AKI
transition-of-care tool in improving health outcomes.

Neurocognitive deficits represent a core component of several major neuropsychiatric disorders, including
schizophrenia, affective disorders, autism spectrum disorders, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and
are not merely an epiphenomenon reflecting symptom severity, environmental deprivation, or medication side
effects. The centrality of cognition to mental health is reflected in the RDoC matrix, in which “Cognitive
Systems” is one of the six fundamental domains of investigation. Moreover, cognitive deficits are associated
with poor functional outcomes, and are generally not well treated by existing psychotropic medications. Based
on family studies and longitudinal observations, it has long been recognized that cognitive abnormalities are (to
a significant degree) genetically mediated endophenotypes of serious mental illnesses. The Cognitive
Genomics Consortium (COGENT), led by the PI of this application, has conducted a series of genome-wide
association studies (GWAS) of cognitive phenotypes, which have confirmed the significant genetic overlap
between cognitive performance and most forms of psychiatric illness at the molecular level.
During five years of NIMH funding, this project has resulted in 13 publications, including the largest cognitive
GWAS to date (N=373,617 yielding 241 significant loci) and the first large exome study identifying rare variants
associated with cognitive performance in the general population. Moreover, we applied novel approaches to
dissecting the pleiotropy observed between cognition and psychopathology, identifying “meta-loci” which are
regions of the genome that underly specific patterns of pleiotropic overlap between phenotypes. This work has
yielded new treatment targets, as well as biological insights on a dissociation between neurodevelopmental
(prenatal) pathways vs adult synaptic processes underlying distinct forms of cognitive function and dysfunction.
Over the next five years, we propose three main aims to extend our previous work, with an emphasis on
biological interpretability and potential clinical applicability of results. First, we will add new, ethnically diverse
cohorts for further cognitive GWAS and rare variant analysis, and we will seek to identify key subdomains of
cognitive function for further downstream analysis. Second, we will incorporate these cognitive subdomains as
well as newly available, large-scale neuroimaging genomics data in a novel set of analyses, derived from our
“meta-loci” approach, to parse psychiatric phenotypes into biologically coherent subcomponents. Third, we will
construct novel, biologically-informed polygenic risk scores (PRS) and test whether these have greater
prognostic value as compared to conventional, genome-wide PRS based on single-trait GWAS. Thus, our plan
leverages diverse large-scale genomics resources, and a range of expertise, to derive actionable information
(novel treatment targets, biological mechanisms, and biomarkers) relating to a range of psychiatric disorders.

 Red cell disorders affect more than 1 billion people worldwide, are a significant cause of morbidity and
mortality and lead to a substantial economic burden. These disorders can result from a decrease in survival or
in production (or both). Our research is focused on erythropoiesis and how this process goes awry in disorders
such as Diamond Blackfan anemia (SCD), sickle cell disease (SCD) and anemia of inflammation. Our work has
highlighted differences between neonatal and adult human erythropoiesis and used these findings to reveal the
mechanism of steroid resistance in DBA. In parallel, we studied the mechanism of action of immunomodulatory
drugs during erythropoiesis and how they increase fetal hemoglobin production in SCD. We recently identified
the nature of the erythroblastic island in normal erythropoiesis and under inflammatory conditions. Together,
these discoveries have allowed for a better understanding of normal and disordered erythropoiesis.
 Nevertheless, critical basic and translational questions remain in DBA and SCD. The proposed research
program builds upon Dr. Blanc’s productive research track record to determine (i) why the erythropoietic defect
in DBA manifests after birth, (ii) how the erythroblastic island in the bone marrow contributes to the
pathophysiology of DBA and SCD and (iii) identifying new targets and treatments for DBA and SCD.
 To answer these questions, we propose an ambitious research program divided into three projects. The
first will investigate the impact of differential regulation of ribosome biogenesis and cell cycle length in fetal versus
adult erythropoiesis. The second will address the contribution of the newly characterized erythromyeloblastic
island to the pathophysiology of DBA and SCD and the third will focus on identifying and testing new drugs for
the treatment of these two hematologic disorders.
 As a whole this program should (i) offer new models to study ribosomal protein biology relevant to heart
and blood disorders, (ii) explain how the erythroid niche universally contributes to inflammation in hematologic
disorders and (iii) offer new therapies for the treatment of bone marrow failure syndromes and sickle cell disease.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：ABSTRACT/PROJECT SUMMARY
Psychotic symptoms that occur in advanced age in the absence of an acute medical condition or prominent
mood symptoms can represent the late appearance of primary psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia or
delusional disorder or can presage the appearance of a neurodegenerative condition such as Alzheimer’s
disease (AD). An episode of non-affective psychosis late in life more than doubles the risk of subsequent
neurodegenerative disease, with an average time from psychosis to AD diagnosis of 18 months. The biologic
mechanisms responsible for the increased risk of dementia in those who experience psychosis are unclear.
One hypothesis is reverse causality, in which inchoate neurodegeneration is responsible for psychotic
symptoms that emerge in the absence of traditional cognitive hallmarks of dementia. The psychosis then
heralds the inception of illness that will eventuate in cognitive decline. An increased burden of tau pathology
has been associated with psychosis in AD. In the current pilot study will utilize PI-2620, a novel tau positron
emission tomography (PET) ligand, together with single molecule array (SiMOA) peripheral fluid
immunoassays to investigate whether there is evidence of elevations in tau biomarkers in a cohort of late-onset
psychosis subjects without cognitive impairment. At the completion of this exploratory study, we will know
whether there is evidence of tau pathology from high-sensitivity biomarkers in late-onset psychosis that would
warrant a larger R01 study that would be focused on longitudinal outcomes assessing the influence of tau
biomarker positivity on the risk of conversion to dementia over time.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：EnClear Therapies is developing new technology for more effective drug delivery to the brain and combining our technology with QurAlis who are developing exciting gene therapy approaches for Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD). Excitingly, recent research has functionally linked TDP-43 to stathmin-2 (STMN2) in FTD patient tissue. It is known that the loss of normal TDP-43 function as a regulator of RNA metabolism causes incorrect splicing of STMN2. STMN2 is essential for axonal and neuromuscular junction maintenance and repair. When STMN2 expression is lost, age-induced neurodegeneration and associated dementias, like FTD, are promoted. This newly discovered link between STMN2 and neuronal plasticity, along with STMN2’s interaction with TDP-43, suggests that STMN2 targeting represents a novel and exciting approach for developing a potential therapy for FTD. QurAlis analyzed the STMN2 RNA sequence to identify regions for splice regulation and developed splice switching antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) that target these sequences. The ASO dose-dependently restores STMN2 mRNA levels. We now aim to deliver the QurAlis ASOs to target affected neurons in FTD. Gene therapies have been plagued with poor tissue distribution and penetration. A number of gene therapies have been “shelved” or failed clinical trials because of the challenge of reaching brain parenchyma in sufficient quantities. The EnClear system is capable of controlling CSF flow precisely by utilizing our sensor array to understand patients’ physiologic responses to adjust drug infusion rate, CSF flow rate, flow direction and to “oscillate” drug concentration over specific tissue targets. This level of CSF flow control is first-in- class and makes the EnClear system unique and potentially capable of personalized drug delivery to patients with CNS diseases. In this Fast Track NIH/SBIR proposal, our aims in Phase 1 are to gain understanding of the flow dynamics of our system using sheep as our animal model. Employing live imaging we will develop the ideal algorithm for precision drug delivery. After imaging, the drug methotrexate used for treating brain cancer, will be administered. At necropsy, CNS drug tissue concentrations will be quantified to confirm our ability for precision drug delivery and to avoid “off-target” drug delivery. This knowledge gained in Phase 1 related to precision drug targeting will be applied to a larger cohort where we will use our insights on precision drug delivery incorporated into our CSF flow algorithm to dose QurAlis’ STMN2 ASO to target the neurodegenerative disease FTD. In Phase 2, we will confirm distribution of STMN2 ASO to relevant areas of the brain. Results will be applied to the development of the STMN2 ASO as a therapy for FTD patients. Results from this grant will go towards FDA approval of EnClear’s delivery technology with data supporting broad applications to benefit drug delivery for small and large molecules, and gene therapies for many CNS diseases including Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Alzheimer’s Disease Related Dementias (ADRD) such as FTD.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is the second most common cause of neurodegenerative dementia after
Alzheimer’s disease (AD). DLB is a more rapidly progressive disease than AD, with a median time from diagnosis
to death or nursing home admission that is half that seen in AD and is associated with extensive burden on both
patients and family caregivers. There is a great unmet medical need, with no approved treatments, only AD and
Parkinson’s disease (PD) drugs used off-label to partially or temporarily relieve some of its severe cognitive and
motor symptoms. The proposed treatment, neflamapimod, an orally bioavailable, highly specific inhibitor of the
intracellular enzyme p38 mitogen activated protein kinase alpha (p38α), is in clinical development by EIP Pharma
with a phase 2a study in DLB and phase 2 studies in early AD already completed. Preclinical data indicate that
neflamapimod, through inhibiting p38α, therapeutically targets specific pathogenic mechanisms underlying
dysfunction and degeneration of neurons in a part of the brain called the basal forebrain, abnormalities in which
are considered to be the major pathogenic drivers of the dementia in DLB. For example, neflamapimod increased
the number of functioning basal forebrain cholinergic neurons in Ts2 transgenic mice that, along with modeling
Down syndrome, develop neurodegeneration in the basal forebrain cholinergic system. Together, such evidence
provides a strong scientific rationale for neflamapimod as a disease modifying treatment for DLB. In accordance
with this, neflamapimod received Fast-Track designation by the FDA for DLB. A recently completed phase 2a
exploratory (i.e., hypothesis-generating) clinical trial (NCT04001517) in 91 patients with mild-to-moderate DLB,
also receiving cholinesterase inhibitor therapy, provided preliminary evidence of clinical efficacy of neflamapimod
on various cognitive, motor, and functional aspects of the disease. The proposed phase 2b trial will confirm and
expand upon these results. The Specific Aims are to, in the context of performing a phase 2b randomized,
double- blind, placebo-controlled, 16-week treatment study of neflamapimod (40mg TID) in 160 subjects with
mild-to-moderate DLB: (Aim 1). Demonstrate that neflamapimod improves cognition and function, based on
primary (Neuropsychological Test Battery) and secondary (Clinical Dementia Rating Scale sum of boxes, Timed
Up and Go test, The Alzheimer’s Disease Cooperative Study – Clinical Global Impression of Change) efficacy
measures in patients with mild-to-moderate DLB receiving cholinesterase inhibitors; (Aim 2). Assess
neuropsychiatric outcomes and safety/tolerability during treatment with neflamapimod in patients with DLB; and
(Aim 3). Assess effects of neflamapimod on electroencephalographic (EEG) measures of DLB, specifically beta
functional connectivity and alpha-reactivity; both markers of basal forebrain cholinergic dysfunction. Successful
completion of this phase 2b trial will inform our pivotal phase 3 trial, advancing neflamapimod as a disease-
modifying treatment for DLB and providing hope for these patients and their families.

This mentored research project focuses on the intersection between two urgent and related threats to older
adults’ health and safety: Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) and elder mistreatment (EM).
Elder mistreatment (EM) prevalence estimates for older adults with cognitive impairment range from 27.5%-
55%. High prevalence of EM among persons with dementia (PWD) is unsurprising considering that many of
the risk factors for EM are related to dependency and caregiving. However, logistical and methodological
challenges as well as the high costs associated with studying mistreatment among PWD have contributed to a
dearth of research on the topic. Existing research has relied on small, cross-sectional studies and have not
provided the data required to produce evidence-based tools for EM screening and intervention tailored to the
growing population of PWD. This project will fill critical knowledge gaps by leveraging an already existing large
longitudinal dataset from UCLA’s Alzheimer’s and Dementia Care Program (ADC Program) to describe the
phenomenon of EM and identify modifiable risk factors for EM among PWD that can be applied in subsequent
intervention generation, refinement, and adaptation. Aim 1 is a qualitative study of expert dementia care
specialists (DCS) experiences with EM to inform revisions to a data abstraction tool used in Aim 2. Focus
groups with DCS from 16 clinical settings across the US will be conducted to examine: perspectives on EM
frequency, severity, and triggers; barriers and facilitators to identifying EM in patients with varying levels of
dementia severity; and ethical and practical implications of addressing EM. Aim 2 will describe EM type and
frequencies among a well-defined sample of PWD from the ADC program. To conduct the analyses, EM data
will be extracted from patient medical records and combined with existing sociodemographic and clinical
measures. Aim 3 will utilize the same ADC program dataset to characterize EM risk and protective factors
among patient/caregiver dyads using hierarchical logistic regression modeling comparing PWD who
experienced EM to those who did not. Kristin Lees Haggerty, PhD, a Project Director and researcher at
Education Development Center (EDC), is in an ideal position to lead this work. Dr. Lees Haggerty has an
academic background in population health and applied psychology, demonstrated productivity in aging
research, and a strong network of collaborators and mentors in academic, clinical, and community settings. Dr.
Lees Haggerty has developed a comprehensive training and mentorship plan that will prepare her to become
an independent investigator devoted to improving older adults’ health and safety. The training plan includes
course work and experiential learning opportunities addressing four key areas: ADRD research; clinical trial
design and implementation science; health care policy making; and manuscript and grant writing. The
interdisciplinary mentorship team includes national leaders with expertise in the identified training areas and
extensive experience mentoring junior investigators who are strongly committed to supporting Dr. Lees
Haggerty’s development into an independent investigator.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Abstract: We have developed ViTrack™, a cuffless, wrist-wearable device that uses a fundamentally new
method to accurately and non-invasively measure BP continuously. ViTrack’s beat-to-beat accurate
measurements, irrespective of patient movement or wrist level to the heart, provide the patient’s circadian BP
pattern, including 24-hr mean BP, nighttime BP, and BP variability (BPV). In addition, ViTrack also measures
heart rate and respiratory parameters and advanced hemodynamics. The hypertensive diseases of pregnancy
(HDP) are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. The current standard for measuring BP in pregnant
women is the periodic use of oscillometric arm-cuff devices. The oscillometric devices indirectly estimate systolic
(SBP) and diastolic BPs (DBP) based on artery wall oscillations during cuff-deflation. Measurement errors
inherent to this indirect method, patient posture/movement, and wrong cuff size lead to unreliable BP
measurements in 50% of routine office visits. Oscillometric device errors are compounded in pregnant women
due to hemodynamic and vascular changes that reduce oscillations of the arterial wall, resulting in BP
underestimation. In contrast, these hemodynamic changes will have less impact on ViTrack measurements
because it utilizes pressure-dependent spatiotemporal skin displacement to measure SBP and DBP directly. In
addition, random clinic measurements during antenatal visits lead to a 30% wrong diagnosis of HDP due to white
coat or masked hypertension. In addition, there is a need for remote and continuous accurate measurement of
BP for prediction and early deduction of preeclampsia. The 24-hour BP parameters, such as 24-hr mean SBP,
nighttime BP, and BPV, are better predictors of preeclampsia than clinic BP measurements. ViTrack, the first
standalone, wearable, connected device, can provide remote, accurate circadian BP data for correct diagnosis
and enable predictive monitoring for better outcomes.
Our objectives in this Phase II study are: (1) to assess the accuracy of ViTrack SBP and DBP measurements in
pregnant women and as well as in women with severe preeclampsia; (2) to evaluate patient tolerance (i.e.,
comfort) and reliability of ViTrack’s beat-to-beat 24-hr BP measurements, and assess usability; (3) to compare
the 24-hr BP profile in pregnant women with and without HDP; and (4) to compare the number of
hypotensive/hypertensive episodes with ViTrack continuous measurements vs. the current standard of care of
intermittent cuff measurements. The data generated will validate ViTrack as the first standalone wearable
technology for accurate and continuous monitoring of BP during pregnancy.

Chemeleon, Inc. is a NYC-based startup that is developing a novel colorimetric biosensor that rapidly diagnoses
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leaks at the Point-of-Care (POC), such as by doctors to diagnose Traumatic Brain
Injury (TBI) patients in the Emergency Department (ED), or the Emergency Medical Technician (EMT) in the
ambulance, or during intraoperative and post-operative care for spinal and otolaryngological surgeries. CSF
leaks occur when the fluid that cushions the brain and spine escapes through ruptures in the surrounding
membranes. These leaks are largely caused by TBIs but are also a risk during spinal surgeries, otolaryngological
surgeries, lumbar punctures and epidurals and they can also be spontaneous. Distinguishing CSF leaks from
other bodily fluids is a well-known problem for ED doctors, EMTs and surgeons as the leaks often present as
unilateral rhinorrhea or otorrhea, a clear watery discharge from the nose or ear, or as a mixture with blood and
other fluids during spinal surgery. Currently there are no POC diagnostics for CSF leaks and existing methods
require patient samples to be sent to third-party laboratories for results that can take 4-7 days. Treatment delays
or misdiagnoses significantly increase the risk for life-threatening meningitis, infections and stroke. Patients with
CSF rhinorrhea that develop meningitis have also have much higher morbidity rates. Additionally, the weeklong
stay not only causes significant distress and discomfort for the patient, but also leads to radically higher
healthcare costs. In this Direct-to-Phase II proposal, Chemeleon aims to advance CSF leak diagnosis by
developing a novel, inexpensive biosensor that requires no additional equipment or personnel training that can
provide results in minutes, enabling medical professionals to make time-sensitive decisions. Chemeleon has
already successfully developed a prototype Binding-Induced Nanostructured Dynamic Surface (BINDS) Assay
that binds the CSF protein biomarker, beta-2-transferrin (b2TR). This BINDS platform technology integrates
nanophotonic reporter surfaces with b2TR-specific aptamer receptors, where binding of b2TR to the sensor
surface alters the surface energy producing a vibrant color change that is visible to the naked eye. Proof-of-
concept experiments revealed that Chemeleon’s BINDS CSF assay could detect 1 µg/ml of b2TR in 10 minutes,
which is higher than the 4-5 µg/ml found in CSF. For Direct-to-Phase II studies, the CSF sensor will be further
developed to achieve the high specificity, high sensitivity and low readout time required for use in clinical and
field settings. Chemeleon will focus on (1) optimizing sensor performance to rapidly distinguish CSF from nasal
fluid and blood samples, (2) finalizing manufacturing processes for efficient scale-up, and (3) designing and
testing a commercial in vitro diagnostic prototype. Chemeleon’s CSF sensor will provide advancements in
decision-making for head trauma, spinal and otolaryngological surgical cases and present a modular platform
for the development of other healthcare diagnostics.

 Hemophilia A results from a deficiency of FVIII-activity and can result in severe bleeding. Head bleeds
can be debilitating and joint-bleeds require major medical intervention. In this Phase IIB (PIIB) effort, we will
leverage our CE-marked FVIII fluorogenic substrate assay (FSA) to develop a cost-effective point-of-
care (POC) solution for measuring FVIII and emicizumab with a 15-minute turnaround time. Hemophilia
A is an X-linked recessive genetic disorder with an incidence of 1 in 5000 live male births. For patients with
hemophilia A, lifelong treatment is required to provide adequate and therapeutic FVIII or emicizumab FVIII-like
levels. FVIII replacement monitoring is essential to maintaining optimal dosing. Acute bleeding and surgeries
require knowledge of FVIII and/or FVIII-like levels for proper management. There are currently no approaches
at the point-of-care for FVIII or FVIII-like measurements, resulting in challenges to implementation and access.
 We have developed three innovations: (1) a high-sensitivity CE-marked FVIII fluorogenic assay
with bovine reagents and an emicizumab assay with human reagents, (2) pilot production test
cartridges that employ 4D microfluidics, a novel innovation we have developed for full sample-to-
answer processing, and (3) a pilot production hemophilia monitoring device and app that meets all CE-
marking and FDA 510k design control requirements. Three aims are outlined to attain data for CE-marking
and FDA 510k clearance: (1) Assess the accuracy and precision of all steps in our CLIA-waivable 4D sample-
to-answer microfluidic cartridge, consumables, and controls. (2) Characterize hemophilia monitoring solution
for turnaround time (TAT), analytical precision, interferences, ranges, limits of detection, and blind sample
analysis for FVIII and FVIII-like activity. (3) Perform clinical validation with Boston Children’s Hospital (N =
300) and a contract research organization (CRO) (N = 1200). In all these studies, we will continue to work with
the World Federation of Hemophilia (WFH) to ensure we have an approach for all patients worldwide.
 The success of developing a hemophilia POC diagnostic will allow a precision medicine approach for
the management of hemophilia A. Home use will allow for more frequent measurement of FVIII levels to
ensure therapeutic levels prior to engaging in physical activity and to assess correct dosage administration,
including potential missed doses. The approach can be utilized to create FVIII activity trends which can be
translated into immediate pK data, which can alert care providers to test for inhibitors. It will allow newer
therapies, including emicizumab, extended half-life PEGylated FVIII, and gene therapies to be monitored. The
results of our efforts will be a human-centered, hemophilia monitoring device and app that will provide accurate
and easy-to-use tests with the goals of decreasing risk of unexpected bleeding and increasing patient care in
all settings.

The synthetic lethal interaction of BRCA deficiency with PARPi is being exploited therapeutically in diverse
clinical contexts, including ovarian, pancreatic, and prostate cancers). However, PARPi resistance has emerged
as a vexing clinical problem for the treatment of BRCA1/2-deficient ovarian cancer carcinomas. Analyses of
PARPi resistance in BRCA1-mutant tumors across independent studies suggest that loss of genes involved in
either promoting NHEJ or suppressing HR leads to the partial restoration of HR in the absence of BRCA1 activity.
53BP1 emerged as the master regulator that brings multiple complexes to the DSB. Loss of any of these factors
causes PARPi resistance in BRCA1 mutant cells. Therefore, further understanding of factors that regulate the
processing of DNA ends that are crucial for pathway choice have tremendous relevance in cancer biology.
 Our lab has previously identified that in ovarian cancer cells, loss of DYNLL1, a factor that is constitutively
bound to 53BP1, also results in enhanced HR and PARPi resistance. We found that DYNLL1pS88 directly binds
to and inhibits MRE11, thereby blocking the initiation of DNA end resection. However, how the interaction of
DYNLL1 with MRE11 impairs its nuclease activity or its recruitment to foci remains unexplored. Furthermore,
how this interaction is regulated in the context of the DNA damage response, for example, which
kinase/phosphatase(s) regulates the phosphorylation of S88 residue of DYNLL1 to modulate its interaction with
MRE11 needs to be investigated.
 Our overall objectives in this application are to identify the molecular mechanism(s) regulating repair
pathway choice by further understanding how end resection proteins are regulated. Our central hypothesis is
that cell cycle-specific regulation of DYNLL1 promotes BRCA1/BARD1 mediated ubiquitination of MRE11,
thereby facilitating end resection at DSBs in S phase.
 We aim to understand the mechanism by which DYNLL1 mediates end resection and HR. We will first
investigate the dynamics between BRCA1 and DNA-PKcs and how it regulates the DYNLL1 and MRE11 activity
in the context of the cell cycle. Investigating the dynamics of these end resecting factors and their regulation in
DSB repair bear significant clinical relevance in combating PARPi resistance in BRCA1-mutant tumors.
Therefore, we propose to determine whether alterations in mechanisms involved in attenuated DNA end
resection may drive development of PARPi resistance in the high grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) using
patient derived xenografts (PDXs) and primary tumors. We expect that these studies will further our
understanding of how end resection machinery is regulated to ensure that the appropriate repair pathway is
activated. Further understanding of these end resection factors and how they are dysregulated in cancer may
lead us to a relevant therapeutic target to combat PARPi resistant cancers.

Meiosis is a specialized form of cell division that results in the formation of gametes. Meiotic recombination is a
crucial step in this process during which homologous chromosomes physically interact and exchange genetic
information. The final recombination DNA intermediate in this process is the double Holliday Junction (dHJ). A
major question in the meiosis field is the mechanism through which dHJs are resolved in a biased manner to
create crossover products between homologs. Mlh1-Mlh3, the nuclease responsible for resolving the majority
of dHJs in budding yeast, does not appear to be intrinsically capable of recognizing and cleaving dHJs in a
biased manner. This observation combined with genetic screens revealing a wide variety of crossover
promoting factors indicates that other proteins may interact at the dHJ to promote biased resolution. Here I aim
to interrogate Exo1, a crossover promoting factor with well-established roles as a nuclease in homology
directed repair (HDR) and mismatch repair (MMR). Interestingly, despite playing an important role in crossover
formation previous work shows that catalytically deficient exo1 mutants do not suffer reductions in crossover
frequencies, suggesting a meiotic role for Exo1 that is independent of its nuclease activity. Here, I will
investigate the mechanism through which Exo1 promotes the formation of crossovers. I hypothesize that Exo1
acts as a scaffold at the dHJ to stabilize and orient Mlh1-Mlh3 through direct interaction with both the DNA and
Mlh1. Additionally, I will follow up on my recent work indicating a pro-CO activity of Exo1 independent of Mlh1
Mlh3 functions that acts upstream of resolution. This work will provide insight into long-standing questions in
the meiosis field and open up exciting new paths for future research.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Project Summary / Abstract
 Though CD8+ T cell-based immunotherapies have revolutionized treatment for hematologic cancers and
chronic viral infections, T cell exhaustion remains a barrier to fully realizing their therapeutic potential. T cell
exhaustion is the hierarchical loss of proliferation, cytokine production, and effector function of CD8+ T cells after
chronic antigen stimulation. Not every T cell becomes exhausted to the same degree or at the same rate, but
the factors governing heterogeneity in susceptibility to exhaustion are undefined. The Rudd lab was the first to
show that a previously-overlooked source of heterogeneity within the naïve CD8+ T cell pool—developmental
origin—is deterministic in a CD8+ T cell’s fate after acute infection. We believe that developmental origin is also
consequential in chronic infection, for our preliminary data shows that neonatal CD8+ T cells (derived from the
fetal liver) are resistant to phenotypic and functional exhaustion, whereas adult cells (derived from adult bone
marrow) are more susceptible. We also showed that overexpressing Lin28b, an oncofetal RNA-binding protein
that negatively regulates let-7 microRNAs and is only expressed in fetal liver HSCs, is sufficient to convert the
adult phenotype to the neonatal one. Our objective is therefore to dissect the developmentally-regulated
programs underlying differential responses to chronic stimulation. We will use innovative approaches to test our
hypothesis that adult CD8+ T cells are more susceptible to exhaustion than neonatal cells due to age-related
differences in let-7/Lin28b expression that program metabolism away from aerobic glycolysis. In Aim 1, we will
determine how developmental origin and Lin28b expression impact propensity for CD8+ T cell exhaustion.
Results from this aim will make clear how distinct subsets of exhausted cells arise among differently-aged CD8+
T cells, and shed light on whether developmental pathways protect against irreversible exhaustion. In Aim 2, we
will determine how Lin28b-mediated metabolic programs underlie differently-aged cells’ susceptibility to become
exhausted. These results will provide a mechanistic explanation for how developmental imprinting affects T cell
exhaustion dynamics. By investigating the developmentally-distinct CD8+ T cell response to chronic infection,
and the role that let-7, Lin28b, and metabolic programing play in said response, this proposal will uncover a
previously-unexplored factor in determining T cell exhaustion. Because developmentally-ingrained pathways are
common to all T cells, understanding these pathways—and finding strategies to fine-tune them—will have wide-
reaching implications for neonatal disease, chronic infection, and cancer alike.

Coriell Institute for Medical Research (Coriell) proposes to maintain and expand the NIGMS
Human Genetic Cell Repository (HGCR). The NIGMS HGCR, established in 1972 at Coriell by
the National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS), provides a readily accessible,
centralized resource for biospecimens from individuals with inherited disorders, chromosomal
abnormalities, apparently healthy individuals, and individuals of diverse geographic origins for
use in biomedical research. The primary goal of the NIGMS HGCR is to stimulate and facilitate
biomedical research, teaching, and the diagnosis and prevention of human genetic diseases by
establishing and maintaining a repository of high quality, uncontaminated, well characterized,
and clinically well-documented cell lines and DNA and making these resources available to
investigators throughout the U.S. and abroad. The NIGMS HGCR mission is in line with the
NIGMS mission, which is “to support research that increases understanding of life processes
and lays the foundation for advances in disease diagnosis, treatment and prevention”. The
NIGMS HGCR’s activities, all governed by high standards of quality, will include (1) collection,
establishment, characterization, maintenance, and distribution of cell lines, (2) preparation,
storage and distribution of DNA from cell lines, (3) the development and offering of special
genetic services and biomaterials in response to customer requests, (4) maintenance of a
comprehensive database and online catalog, and (5) publicizing the NIGMS HGCR’s
collections. The NIGMS HGCR will maintain, grow and distribute the current collection of
approximately 11,800 unique cell lines, 6,400 DNA samples, and 54 human iPSC lines in its
online catalog, as well as newly acquired resources. The NIGMS HGCR will continue to create
human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines at Coriell by reprogramming certain NIGMS
HGCR cell lines. Additionally, Coriell is committed to integrating state-of-the-art technologies
into its activities and will continue to offer a wide range of cutting edge services that enhance
the utility of the HGCR collection to the genetic research community.

 hematopoietic stem cell homeostasis and function
Abstract
Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) possess the abilities to both produce stem cells, a
property known as self-renewal, and give rise to all differentiated hematopoietic lineages.
Clinically, HSCs are therapeutically valuable for transplantation in treatment of various
hematologic malignances. Despite remarkable progress made in the research of HSCs
during the past three decades, the molecular mechanisms regulating HSC homeostasis
and function are still not fully understood.
Our previous published showed that GSK3 plays an essential role in regulating HSC
homeostasis. Specifically, knockdown of Gsk3 promote transient expansion and long-term
exhaustion of HSC in vivo. Our new preliminary studies demonstrated that GSK3 functions
through PPAR-δ/FAO/mitophagy pathway to regulate HSC division symmetry; inhibition
of GSK3 induces mitophagy and conversely, blocking PPAR-δ/FAO/mitophagy can
reverse the enhanced self-renewal phenotype that is associated with GSK3 inhibition. In
this study, we will first examine how GSK3 regulates PPAR-δ, which in turn regulates
mitophagy and HSC division symmetry. Secondly, we will investigate whether loss-of-
function of Ppar-δ, Park2 or Pink1 (two mitophagy key regulators) reverse the functional
defect of Gsk3b-deficient HSC in vivo. Lastly, we will explore whether GSK3 controls FAO
and lipid metabolism to regulate HSC function and homeostasis.
Our study will provide significant new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying
GSK3-dependent regulation of HSC homeostasis and function. The knowledge learned
may facilitate bone marrow transplantation for treating diverse hematological diseases.

Abstract
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a malignant hematopoietic disease and the most common type of acute
leukemia in adults. One major obstacle to greater success with target therapy of leukemia is drug resistance.
The mechanisms underlying drug resistance in AML are poorly understood. FLT3 is a cytokine receptor which
belongs to the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) class III. Activating mutations in FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3
(FLT3) are now recognized as the most common molecular abnormality in AML and FLT3ITD mutations are
found in nearly 30% of AML patients. Quizartinib (AC220) is a potent and selective second-generation inhibitor
of FLT3. It is in clinical trials for the treatment of relapsed or refractory FLT3ITD positive and negative AML
patients and as maintenance therapy. Remarkably, those clinical trials have showed very promising result.
However, drug resistance to AC220 has also been reported through the early clinical studies.
To understand the underlying mechanisms of drug resistance to AC220, we undertook an unbiased approach
with a novel CRISPR pooled library to screen new genes whose loss of function confers resistance to AC220.
In our screen, we identified SPRY3, an intracellular inhibitor of RTK signaling, and GSK3, a canonical Wnt
signaling antagonist, and demonstrated that re-activation of downstream RTK/Ras/ERK and Wnt signaling as
major mechanisms of resistance to the FLT3 inhibitor. Furthermore, we also confirmed our findings in primary
AML patient samples. We demonstrated that the expression level of SPRY3 and GSK3A is dramatically
reduced in AC220 resistant AML samples and SPRY3 deleted primary AML cells are resistant to AC220.
Additionally, we treated SPRY3 and GSK3 knockout AML cells with a potent MAP kinase inhibitor and β-
catenin inhibitor respectively, demonstrated that both inhibitors re-sensitized AML cells to AC220. Intriguingly,
we found that expression of SPRY3 is greatly reduced in GSK3 knockout AML cells, which positioned SPRY3
downstream of GSK3 in the resistance pathway.
In this proposal, we hypothesize that Sprouty (SPRY) and GSK3 play critical roles in the response to
tyrosine kinase inhibitor in AML. The Ras/MEK/ERK and Wnt pathways regulated by SPRY3 and GSK3
are important for the acquired drug resistance in AML. Next, we will perform a series comprehensive study
to explore novel downstream effectors/ interacting partners of SPRY3 and GSK3 in AMLs and the molecular
mechanisms of their action. Furthermore, we will examine the possibility to translate our findings into new
clinical therapies.
Taken together, our study identified novel genes whose loss of function confers resistance to a selective FLT3
inhibitor and revealed the underlying mechanism, thereby providing new insight into signaling pathways that
contribute to the acquired resistance in AML. The knowledge learned may lead to the development of more
efficient combined therapeutic avenues for AML.

Testicular germ cell tumors (TGCTs) are exceptionally sensitive to conventional genotoxic chemotherapy. This
is likely due to the distinct DNA damage response (DDR) features of TGCTs and the germ cells from which they
arise. Unlike somatic cells which often respond to DNA damage by arresting the cell cycle and conducting DNA
repair, germ cells as well as long-lived pluripotent stem cells typically avoid the use of error-prone repair
mechanisms and favor apoptosis, reducing the risk of genetic alterations in subsequent generations. Similarly,
the TGCT precursor lesion, germ cell neoplasia in situ, does not show activation of a DDR, whereas precursor
lesions of most somatic cancers express markers of an activated DDR in response to oncogene activation which
serves as a barrier to tumor progression. To study TGCTs, our lab has developed the first genetically engineered
mouse model of malignant TGCTs by conditional activation of Kras, an oncogene, and inactivation of Pten, a
tumor suppressor gene, in germ cells. The malignant teratocarcinomas generated in these mice are composed
of pluripotent embryonal carcinoma (EC) and differentiated teratoma tissue. Interestingly, EC cells, both in vivo
and cultured in vitro, express stem cell markers, have tumor propagating activity, and are readily killed following
chemotherapy treatment. Using cells derived from this model, the experiments proposed here will elucidate the
DDR properties of TGCTs and the cells from which they arise, which will inform the mechanisms underlying their
exceptional chemosensitivity. Specifically, this proposal aims to: understand how the cells that give rise to
TGCTs respond to oncogenic events, apparently avoiding DDR activation (Aim 1), and determine the mechanism
underlying the chemosensitivity of the embryonal carcinoma components of TGCTs and the chemoresistance of
their differentiated counterparts (Aim 2). Aim 1 will be investigated by generating primordial germ cell-like cells
(PGCLCs) and embryonic germ cell-like cells (EGCLCs) from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived
from mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) with conditional Pten and Kras alleles and assessing malignant
transformation, the degree of DNA replication stress, the extent of DNA damage, and the nature of the DDR in
untransformed and transformed cells. For Aim 2, I will analyze differential gene expression in EC and
differentiated cells before and after treatment with genotoxic chemotherapy and investigate the role of
differentially regulated pathways in the chemosensitivity phenotype. It is critically important to study this curable
cancer because understanding the basis of TGCT chemosensitivity will apply broadly to the development of
treatments for the many other cancers that do not respond favorably to conventional chemotherapy. Additionally,
understanding the malignant transformation of pluripotent cell types, including embryonic germ cells and iPSCs,
will be important for the improvement of stem-cell based therapies, which carry the risk of tumorgenicity.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Pancreatic ductal carcinoma (PDAC) is the most common form of pancreatic cancer and is highly lethal and
resistant to therapy. There is a need to explore new, effective, strategies to treat PDAC, given that only ~10% of
the patients survive beyond five years. PDAC overutilize extracellular nutrients to sustain their growth. This
nutrient dependency, coupled with a low blood supply, limits nutrient availability in the PDAC microenvironment.
To achieve therapy and improve patient survival outcome, it is important to understand how PDAC survive in the
nutrient-limited condition and the tumor-intrinsic or microenvironmental factors that sustain their survival. In this
proposal, we show that PDAC cells rely on cysteine at a far greater extent than other amino acids. Metabolomics
profiling revealed that the PDAC cells almost exclusively use cysteine to sustain intracellular glutathione (GSH).
While some PDAC cells rapidly generate GSH when starved of cysteine, others maintain their GSH pool when
starved of both cysteine and arginine, indicating the use of various mechanisms to sustain GSH and survival in
PDAC cells. In addition, we found that under the same cysteine starvation, macrophages produce GSH, which
is an important discovery given the high abundance of macrophages in PDAC microenvironment, their arginine
catabolic function, and that the macrophage-derived GSH could sustain PDAC. In multiple gene expression
datasets of patient tumors, we observed that PDAC express a high level of GSH pathway genes. Based on these
data, we hypothesize that GSH is a core nutrient required for PDAC growth, is potentially sustained by
tumor-associated macrophages, and that disrupting GSH utilization could improve therapy in PDAC. The
aims of this study are 1). to determine the molecular mechanisms driving the dependency of PDAC on GSH –
including the epigenetic regulation of GSH pathway, and 2). to determine the role of tumor-associated
macrophages as a source and modulator of GSH in PDAC. The overarching goal is to explore whether blocking
GSH utilization alone or alongside macrophage activities could be a way to improve PDAC therapy. Aim 1 will
be pursued at the K99 phase, while most of Aim 2 will be pursued at the R00 phase. Methods will include gene
interference (e.g., CRISPR/Cas9, shRNA, siRNA), pharmacological inhibitors of GSH pathways (including the
pentose phosphate pathway), cell culture assays, metabolomics (including stable isotope tracing), dietary mouse
models, bioinformatics, promoter analysis/epigenetic methods, RNA sequencing (single cell and bulk),
immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry and mass cytometry. The project will receive input from a 5-person
mentorship team that have expertise in tumor immunology, metabolism, bioinformatics, and epigenetics. The
expected results could a) offer new insights on disrupting GSH pathway to suppress PDAC growth, b) reveal
new microenvironmental mechanisms that enable tumor adaptation in nutrient-limited state, and c) reveal new
opportunities to overcome resistance to chemotherapy or immunotherapy in PDAC.

 The Golgi complex plays a prominent role in secretory and endocytic trafficking in eukaryotic cells
and is key to the biosynthesis of glycoconjugates (glycoproteins and glycolipids) that are essential for
life. Golgi resident proteins, such as glycosyltransferases and sugar nucleotide transporters, are precisely
distributed across the Golgi stacks by recycling mechanisms that counteract the flow of ongoing vesicular
transport. Dysfunction in these mechanisms, or their hijacking by viruses and toxins, is known to have
serious consequences for human health, leading to congenital disorders of glycosylation, cancers, and
immune dysfunction.
 Membrane proteins residing in various Golgi compartments are well annotated; however, the mecha-
nistic basis of how most Golgi proteins are selected for recycling, or how these processes are regulated
are poorly understood. My lab is interested in uncovering these fundamental mechanisms governing
Golgi homeostasis using a multifaceted approach combining genetics, flow-cytometry, imaging, in vitro
reconstitution, and proteomics. In preliminary results, we have identified novel transmembrane compo-
nents orchestrating recycling of specific subsets of Golgi enzymes. Our findings have opened doors for
interrogating new players and dissecting the mechanisms critical to maintain Golgi identity and function.
Over the next five years, our goals are to (1) identify novel recycling receptors required at different Golgi
compartments and establish a systematic map of the intra-Golgi recycling network, (2) determine how
the transmembrane receptors engage with their cargos, and (3) define the novel functions of a disease-
associated membrane transporter in solute transport and protein recycling in the Golgi. The combined
results of our experiments will elucidate how multiple recycling pathways sustain normal Golgi function,
and how this homeostasis is disrupted in human disease.

DNA mismatch repair (MMR) systems act to excise misincorporation errors that occur during DNA replication.
In eukaryotes MSH proteins recognize these errors in the context of base-base and insertion/deletion
mismatches and recruit MLH complexes to form ternary complexes that work with replication factors (RPA,
RFC, PCNA) and Exo1 to excise the newly replicated DNA strand through the mismatch site. This is followed
by DNA re-synthesis steps. MMR factors also recognize mismatches that form during strand invasion steps in
homologous recombination; they recruit a helicase complex that unwinds (rejects) recombination intermediates
and allows a new homology search. In addition, subsets of MMR factors act in meiosis to resolve
recombination intermediates into crossovers (COs). In baker’s yeast the majority of meiotic COs are formed in
an interference-dependent pathway in which double Holliday junctions (dHJs), thought to be stabilized by
Msh4-Msh5, are resolved through the actions of STR helicase/topoisomerase, Exo1 nuclease, and the MutLγ
(Mlh1-Mlh3) endonuclease. Our work is focused on developing molecular models to explain how the different
MSH and MLH factors act in the above pathways. This work will enable us to understand how molecular
defects in these factors underlie human infertility and hereditary forms of colon cancer, and how chromosomal
rearrangements can lead to disease. We will test these ideas through three distinct research themes. In
Project 1 we are studying how conformational changes in MLH proteins, mediated by ATP binding and
hydrolysis, are linked to strand specificity steps in MMR and meiotic recombination. We will use genetic
(mutations in intrinsically disordered domains in Mlh1-Pms1 and Mlh1-Mlh3 and force dimerization of MLH
proteins), biochemical (in vitro reconstitution reactions to determine specific roles for MLH proteins in MMR and
mass-spectrometry) and single-molecule (examine diffusion along DNA and how proteins bypass barriers)
approaches. Project 2 is focused on understanding how MutLγ acts to resolve dHJs in the ZMM pathway. Our
work in the current grant period is consistent with MutLγ endonuclease being activated in MMR and meiotic
crossing over through the formation of a MutLγ filament. We will use this information and biochemical, mass
spectrometry, and genetic methods that take advantage of our identification of mlh3 separation of function
mutants to identify MutLγ interacting factors. Our early work encourages us to initially focus on MutLγ
interactions with the Exo1 nuclease, after which we will test identified factors alone and in combination for their
ability to interact with MutLγ to cleave model HJ and dHJ substrates. Project 3 is aimed at understanding how
the decision is made to repair or reject recombination intermediates. We will analyze how mutations in histone
chaperones and deacetylases, separately and in combination, affect anti-recombination, and will employ an
inducible system to provide a temporal and physical measure of these effects. This work will also encourage us
to pursue a genome-wide screen to identify new factors that regulate the repair/rejection decision.

Lymphatic vessel (LV) differentiation, development, and morphogenesis are central in maintaining fluid
homeostasis, regulating host immunity, and transporting dietary fat and neuronal waste. All these functions
are governed by lymphatic drainage, a transport of interstitial fluid into the lymphatic system through the initial
LVs and collecting LVs. The initial LVs show permeable button-like junction morphology and are ready to
uptake interstitial fluid; by contrast, the collecting LVs are less permeable with zipper-like junction structure,
so that the collecting LVs transport ‘lymph’ to lymph nodes without leaking. Impaired lymphatic drainage
contributes to many human diseases, such as lymphedema, immune dysfunction, fibrosis, obesity, cancer,
and Alzheimer’s disease. While little is known about why LVs become dysfunctional, clinical studies reveal
that inflammation is one of the leading contributors to the lymphatic dysfunction. Although dysfunctional
collecting LVs has been extensively studied, how inflammation impacts initial LV development and
morphogenesis is unclear, because in our current experimental models, including animal models, we often
cannot decouple multifactorial inflammatory factors in the lymphatic endothelium. Since two-dimensional cell
culture has failed to recapitulate three-dimensional (3D) tissue architecture of lymphatics, researchers have
developed 3D in vitro models of LVs, demonstrating lymphatic sprouting, lymphatic network formation, and
LV interactions with other cells. However, these previous models have not created 3D lymphatic structure
with specialized LEC junction development enabling controlled fluid drainage through the button-like
junctions and physiological inflammatory response. In this proposal, we will use a bioengineered in vitro 3D
lymphatic vascular system, exhibiting button-like junction morphogenesis of the LVs and fluid drainage to
understand the regulation of LEC junction and drainage by focusing on ROCK1/2 and integrin α5 signaling.
In Aim 1, we will examine the roles of ROCKs in LEC junction and drainage. Next, we will scrutinize the
mechanisms of ROCKs-mediated junction zippering in LECs. In Aim 2, we will study integrin α5 mediated
regulation of LEC junction and lymphatic drainage. We will then determine signal transduction through
ROCKs and integrin α5 and evaluate therapeutic efficacy of targeting ROCKs and integrin α5 in lymphatic
dysfunction and inflammation models in vivo. In summary, we will use a bioengineered model of 3D lymphatic
vessels and fluid transport to provide an understanding of lymphatic drainage in normal and inflammatory
conditions.

Viruses that successfully evade clearance without killing the host establish chronic infection.
However, unresolved low-grade inflammation causes morbidity over time, including development
of cancers. How to appropriately modulate immune responses to chronic infection without further
damaging the host represents a major clinical challenge. Type-17 immunity is invoked by
extracellular bacteria and fungi to control resident microbiota and invading pathogens at barrier
surfaces, and to promote tissue repair. Th17 cells have received much attention as drivers of
inflammation in chronic autoimmune diseases. However, there are sparse data regarding the role
of type-17 responses in response to viral infection. Here we have employed the well-characterized
model infection, LCMV clone 13, to test the role of IL-17 during chronic viral infection. IL-17 was
increased systemically during the switch to the chronic phase of infection. Using genetic and
antibody-mediated blockade of IL-17, our data unexpectedly reveal that IL-17 regulates Th1 and
CD8+ T cell activation, exhaustion and immunopathology during LCMV infection. We have
identified lymphoid stromal cells known as fibroblastic reticular cells (FRC) as key intermediaries
of IL-17 effects in secondary lymphoid tissues. Gene expression analysis and antibody-mediated
blockade support a role for excess IFNg in driving T cell exhaustion and immunopathology. These
unexpected findings lead to our central hypothesis that IL-17 has an immunoregulatory role during
chronic infection by limiting antiviral T cell IFNg-mediated exhaustion and immunopathology. This
project is designed to dissect the key elements that we have identified to be required in this
unexplored immunoregulatory pathway in chronic infection by probing the source of critical IL-17
(aim 1), LN stromal cells as targets of IL-17 (aim 2) and IFNg-mediated effects on exhaustion and
immunopathology in absence of IL-17 signaling (aim 3). Together these data will define a novel
and previously unexplored axis operating through IL-17 signaling in stromal cells to regulate IFNg-
mediated pathology, revealing new opportunities for future therapeutic intervention in chronically
infected people.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
Targeted internal radionuclide therapy is a highly efficacious form of cancer treatment that employs
administered radiopharmaceutical agents to destroy malignant cells. Radiopharmaceutical agents of this type
require a biological targeting vector, which selectively recognizes and binds to receptors that are
overexpressed on cancer cells, and a bifunctional chelating agent, which stably binds to and attaches the
radionuclide to the targeting vector. The radionuclide can be chosen and altered to possess different nuclear
decay properties, potentially rendering it valuable for theranostic applications, as long as its coordination
chemistry is compatible with the bifunctional chelator. Conventionally, beta particle emitters have been
leveraged for therapeutic applications, but recent clinical studies have revealed the efficacious nature of alpha
particle emitters for this application. The use of alpha emitters is hindered, however, by a lack of gamma
photon or positron emissions that can be leveraged for theranostic applications and by their unconventional
coordination chemistries, making it challenging to find a suitable bifunctional chelator. This project will address
both of these challenges in alpha particle emitter targeted internal therapy by designing new bifunctional
chelators that can be simultaneously used with diagnostic gamma- or positron-emitting radionuclides. In
Specific Aim 1, new bifunctional chelators for the established highly promising alpha emitter actinium-225 will
be developed. These chelators will be designed so that they can also effectively accommodate the widely
available imaging radionuclide indium-111. With these new chelators, theranostic agents based on actinium-
225 can be easily accessed. Specific Aim 2 will focus on the short-lived alpha emitters lead-212 and bismuth-
213. To make theranostic agents from these radionuclides, bifunctional chelators that can be easily
functionalized with the versatile positron-imaging radionuclide fluorine-18 will be synthesized. Lastly, in Specific
Aim 3, chelators for the unconventional newly arising radionuclides uranium-230, and vanadium-48 will be
developed. Uranium-230 is a therapeutic alpha emitter and vanadium-48 is a diagnostic positron emitter. We
will explore chelating agents that are mutually compatible for these radiometals to enable their use as a
theranostic pair. Through these three aims, this work will increase the diversity of radionuclides with distinct
half-lives and decay chains that can be used for this application. Furthermore, it will give rise to diagnostic
partners for these therapeutic alpha emitters, which is critically important for predicting patient dosimetry,
disease staging, and response. Collectively, the successful execution of this project will give rise to theranostic
alpha-emitting therapeutic agents that can cure and diagnose human disease.

Molecular mechanisms regulating and interpreting BMP signaling
The highly conserved bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling pathway regulates multiple
developmental and homeostatic processes. Malfunction of the pathway can cause a myriad of
somatic and hereditary disorders in humans, including skeletal and cardiovascular diseases,
and cancer. Thus BMP signaling must be tightly regulated to ensure that signaling happens at
the right time, place, level and duration. Due to the vital developmental functions of BMP
signaling, it has been proposed that therapeutically targeting specific BMP modulators is a more
productive way for treating different diseases caused by defects in BMP signaling. C. elegans
provides an excellent model to study the regulation of BMP signaling at single cell resolution
during the development of an intact animal. Using a highly specific and sensitive genetic screen,
we have identified multiple evolutionarily conserved modulators of the BMP pathway. These
modulators include cell surface integral membrane or membrane-anchored proteins,
extracellular secreted proteins, as well as transcription factors. Our research goals under this
MIRA are to determine mechanistically how different BMP modulators function in regulating
BMP signaling, and how BMP signaling is interpreted in specific cellular contexts. We propose
to use a multifaceted approach that combines classical molecular genetic studies with cutting-
edge imaging, proteomic and metabolomic approaches to dissect the functions of the BMP
modulators in C. elegans. Findings from our proposed studies will yield important insights into
the complex and intricate mechanisms regulating and interpreting BMP signaling in a
multicellular living animal. They may also provide potential therapeutic targets for the different
diseases caused by mutations in the BMP pathway.

This proposal requests funds for a Zeiss LSM980 confocal microscope for the Cornell Biotechnology Resource Center (BRC)
Imaging Facility. Currently the imaging facility has two inverted confocal microscopes that are heavily used (average 58
hrs/week for the past two years). The 13-year old Zeiss LSM710 has become obsolete. Though it is still functioning, Zeiss
will no longer guarantee repairs or parts for it. A new confocal microscope is critical to ensuring imaging capacity for our
many NIH researchers at Cornell on the Ithaca campus. Additionally, the requested confocal microscope will have
capabilities that are not currently available on campus, including the fast Airyscan module, the AI sample finder and near-
IR (NIR) detection capabilities. We are requesting a non-linear optical (NLO) capable unit, and will be integrating the
system with an existing multiphoton (NLO) source as well as its associated existing Zeiss beam routing and detection optics.
Data management, scheduling and billing will be accomplished using already established BRC infrastructure. Training will
be carried out by a PhD level staff scientist. The microscope will be available to all researchers on and off campus, and
will advance a broad segment of NIH-funded research programs generally by ensuring sufficient confocal capacity, and
specifically by providing new capabilities for projects requiring fast tiling at high resolution, fast intracellular dynamics,
and the ability for imaging NIR-emitting fluorophores.

We propose to develop a novel therapeutic for respiratory viruses, including all current and predicted SARS-
CoV-2 variants, other coronaviruses, influenza, and paramyxo/pneumoviruses—using a peptidomimetic small
molecule approach targeting TMPRSS2 and other trypsin-like proteases (TTSP) that are essential for virus entry.
We expect our therapeutic platform to be applicable and effective for prophylactic use, and so we will target virus
transmission studies in vivo. As our system is based on simple-to-synthesize peptides, which act outside of the
cell, is it expected to be cost–effective, and our approach is specifically designed to cover a range of distinct
viruses. However, it is important to note that our platform is highly flexible, and be applicable in the face of a
novel viruses that may emerge, without significance anti-viral resistance (as it is host-targeted).

The nucleus is the defining feature of eukaryotic cells; it is also the largest and stiffest cell organelle. Increasing
evidence suggest that these physical properties of the nucleus can affect diverse cellular functions, and that
mechanical forces acting on the nucleus conversely modulate nuclear structure and function, including chromatin
organization, gene expression, and genomic integrity. This ‘nuclear mechanobiology’ is particularly relevant in
the context of cell migration in 3D in vivo environments, where cells frequently move through tight interstitial
spaces that require substantial deformation of the cell nucleus. Examples include cell migration during
development, wound healing, inflammation, and cancer metastasis. Our laboratory previously demonstrated that
the required deformation of the nucleus limits the ability of cells to migrate through tight spaces, with highly
migratory cells often having more deformable nuclei, and that nuclear deformation associated with confined
migration can lead to transient nuclear envelope rupture, DNA damage, and changes in chromatin organization.
These findings point to an exciting new concept in which the deformation of the nucleus as cells move through
tight spaces could activate or suppress transcriptional programs that further enhance migration and modulate
other functions, or that could lead to the selection of cells particularly adept at such confined migration.
Nonetheless, many questions remain. Over the next five years, we will focus on three complementary and
synergistic overarching research areas: (1) investigate how cells generate, apply, and coordinate the large
cytoskeletal forces required to move and deform the nucleus through confined spaces; (2) identify the
mechanism(s) responsible for confined migration induced changes in chromatin organization, and (3) determine
the functional consequences of confined migration on cellular fate and functions, along with the underlying
mechanisms. Towards this goal, we have developed several novel experimental platforms that enable extended
live-cell imaging of cells migrating through precisely-defined microenvironments while visualizing nuclear
deformation, nuclear envelope rupture, DNA damage, and chromatin modifications, and that allow collection of
cells after confined migration for subsequent analysis. We will pair these platforms with molecular biology
approaches and assays for genome-wide analysis of changes in 3D chromatin organization and gene expression
in a range of different cell types, reflecting physiological and pathological scenarios. Our ultimate goal is to
uncover general principles in nuclear mechanobiology that will lead to an improved understanding of the impact
of migration through tight spaces on cellular function and fate, including the activation or suppression of specific
transcriptional programs that may further enhance cell migration or modulate other cellular functions. Insights
gained from these studies may help guide therapeutic approach for a variety of clinical conditions, from wound
healing and immune-responses to therapies targeting metastatic tumor cells.

 Transposons are mobile genetic elements that provide an important mechanism for the acquisition of
pathogenesis functions and antibiotic resistance in bacteria. A family of these elements, Tn7 and Tn7-
like elements, tightly control transposition allowing them to be particularly successful across diverse
bacteria. On five distinct occasions discovered by the lab and collaborators these elements have
coopted CRISPR-Cas systems. CRISPR-Cas systems typically function as adaptive immune systems
in prokaryotes that utilize an RNA-based system to recognize and cleave viruses and other invading
DNA elements. In coopting CRISPR-Cas systems they were naturally adapted for guide RNA-directed
transposition suggesting promising new tools for programable editing. As an editing tool, CRISPR-Cas
transposons (CASTs) direct a single cargo DNA into a pre-programmed position in one orientation
without the negative side effects of inducing a double strand break in the target DNA. CAST enable
genome editing of bacteria, individually and in communities. They also have future potential for human
therapeutic gene editing. Despite the potential promise with the CAST systems, major questions
remain about how they function, which limits their broad application. By advancing our understanding
across diverse CAST systems we provide foundational knowledge to enable important genome and
population editing applications. Each of the four projects focuses on CAST systems based on different
families of Tn7-like elements that use different mechanisms of transposase assembly and activation.
This mechanistic understanding will be critical for optimizing these systems and adapting them to new
hosts. Understanding the basic features of all CAST systems will bring the field closer to the
aspirational goal of setting up a system where associations between a transposon and any CRISPR-
Cas system could be engineered de novo. Our work will additionally provide insight into canonical
CRISPR-Cas systems and the unappreciated widespread use of atypical guides for gene regulation.
The mechanistic understanding we gain with diverse CAST elements will allow also allow us to
understand the outsized role of Tn7 and Tn7-like elements in pathogens for the acquisition of antibiotic
resistance and virulence factors.
Relevance to Public Health: Public health will be served because we will provide the framework for
developing important new genome modification techniques that will be broadly applicable for gene
editing, especially for future human therapeutic gene editing. Fundamental information about these
systems will also help us understand molecular mechanisms that allow the evolution of pathogens and
multidrug resistant bacteria though the transfer of genetic information.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Project Summary. Rapid evolution lies at the core of some of the greatest challenges humanity faces today,
ranging from the evolution of drug and antibiotic resistance to the rapid emergence of new Covid variants.
Researchers are now envisioning even faster evolutionary dynamics brought about by CRISPR gene drives.
This fascinating new technology could be used to directly suppress wild populations, or to rapidly spread an
engineered allele through a population, for example a gene that reduces pathogen transmission in mosquitoes.
Unfortunately, current population genetic models are not well-suited to describing such rapid processes,
because they are often still grounded in simplistic assumptions such as a homogeneous, randomly mating
population. Research in my lab centers on the development of new population genetic models and
computational tools for studying rapid evolutionary processes such as CRISPR gene drives that allow us to
better predict their expected outcomes. Over the past five years, my lab has developed a comprehensive
modeling framework for gene drive dynamics. Here, we propose to incorporate increasing levels of biological
realism into this framework to address three broad questions: (1) How can we systematically identify the
features and parameters that are most critical for determining the outcome of a drive release in our
simulations? (2) Is it possible to reliably confine a gene drive to an intended target population, and how could
this be achieved? (3) Could a suppression drive in a mosquito population eradicate diseases such as malaria
or dengue even when it does not achieve complete suppression of the mosquito vector? As gene drive
technology comes ever closer to field experimentation, answers to these questions will be essential for a
realistic evaluation of the expected outcomes of a drive release into a wild population. Motivated by insights
from our modeling work on gene drives, we propose a second line of research focusing on the question of how
continuous space can affect the dynamics of other rapid evolutionary processes, such as strong selective
sweeps, which conceptually resemble the spread of a gene drive in many ways. We hypothesize that similar to
what we found for gene drives, continuous spatial structure could also have a profound impact on the
population dynamics of strong selective sweeps, and thus the signatures they leave in population genomic
data. We plan to study this question using forward genetic simulations together with recently developed
methods for inferring sweep parameters based on supervised machine learning. Finally, we plan to implement
critical improvements in our SLiM evolutionary simulation framework, enabling forward simulation of
populations of billions of individuals, so that we can predict the outcomes of the release of a CRISPR gene
drive into a mosquito population with sufficient accuracy and robustness to facilitate a well-informed discussion
about the feasibility, reliability, and risks of such approaches.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Abstract: Research in my laboratory has centered on the development and application of multi-disciplinary
approaches to study signal transduction pathways important in normal physiology and, when de-regulated,
contribute to a number of diseases. This began with our discovery and cloning of a novel signaling partner for
the epidermal growth factor receptor, the human Cdc42 protein, a small GTPase highly conserved from yeast to
humans, and continued with the identification of many Cdc42 regulatory proteins and signaling targets. The
conservation of Cdc42 throughout evolution accounts for the many fundamentally important roles it plays in cell
biology and organism development, including the regulation of cell growth and migration, and the establishment
of cellular polarity. We then discovered an unanticipated but highly significant function of Cdc42 in directing the
upregulation of glutamine metabolism and metabolic activities that generate building blocks for biosynthetic
processes required in a wide range of cellular functions. This also provides a mechanism for connecting the
various intracellular processes regulated by Cdc42 to the surrounding environment by directing the biogenesis
of extracellular vesicles (EVs), which have been implicated by our laboratory and others in mediating intercellular
communication across the evolutionary spectrum from bacteria to higher organisms. Recently, we found that
Cdc42 activates these metabolic activities through the assembly of large protein complexes. Understanding how
these metabolic/signaling nodes are assembled holds important clues to their regulation and function, as well as
sheds light on a long-standing question of how Cdc42 activates a critically important protein kinase, mTOR
(mechanistic Target of Rapamycin), which is a necessary step for cap-dependent mRNA splicing, the neuronal
differentiation of embryonic stem cells (ESCs), and the survival of cancer cells under stressful conditions.
Elucidating the biochemical and structural features of these large complexes that activate glutamine metabolism
and mTOR, which are essential for cell growth and survival, and helping to move forward the field of EVs
represent major research goals for our laboratory in the next 5 years. Key gaps in our knowledge surrounding
these broad areas of study will be addressed. We want to understand how Cdc42 directs the formation of
metabolic/signaling nodes that not only play such important roles in cell biology but also have significant
implications for disease, define the mechanisms responsible for their regulation, and determine their 3D
structures. We also will set out to address challenging questions to further the development of the EV field, by
identifying the biochemical determinants and signaling cues that dictate the loading of essential EV cargo and
determining the structural features of EVs that enable their various biological functions. To achieve these goals,
we will leverage our expertise in signal transduction and benefit from a strong group of collaborators.

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) perform dual roles in cells, acting as both destructive and constructive agents.
At high levels, intracellular ROS facilitate irreversible macromolecular damage and are associated with a range
of disease pathologies. At lower physiological levels, ROS play important roles in the activation of beneficial
signaling events through the reversible post-translational modification of cysteine and methionine residues.
Despite the emerging appreciation for ROS as constructive signaling agents, and the importance for functional
redox signaling in managing cellular ROS, relatively few redox-signaling pathways have been characterized.
Many proteins susceptible to oxidation have been cataloged. However, the consequences of oxidation and the
physiological outcomes have been established for only a limited number of these targets. We argue this central
knowledge gap limits larger efforts towards the development of effective therapeutics to help manage cellular
ROS. Since its inception, our research program has focused on broadening our knowledge of ROS-based
signaling events. Our overarching goal is to elucidate individual pathways activated by the modification of
protein cysteine and/or methionine by ROS. Our intent is to uncover and to characterize redox-signaling
components, including ROS sources, redox targets, and oxidation regulators, as well as the consequences
(outcomes) for signaling at the protein and physiological level. Our research efforts center on two focus areas:
(1) an analysis of the role for cysteine oxidation in managing ROS within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and
(2) the study of the consequences of protein methionine oxidation (MetO) formation and reduction. Our prior
work established that oxidation of a conserved cysteine in the Hsp70 BiP alters its chaperone activity to sustain
ER function under elevated ROS conditions. Our ongoing work intends to broaden our understanding of redox
signaling at the ER and BiP oxidation, answering the questions: What are the local endogenous sources of
ROS in the ER that are sensed by BiP? How does BiP oxidation influence known ER stress response
pathways? In addition, we intend to bolster the fundamental understanding of MetO formation and resolution
in cells, focusing in parallel on what we consider the most prominent gaps in our knowledge of MetO: What are
the physiological targets of MetO? What is the role for methionine sulfoxide reductases in regulating individual
protein MetO events throughout the cell? By answering these questions, we intend to provide insight into the
basic cell functions used to manage cellular ROS and avert cellular damage. We anticipate that our experience
and expertise, coupled with a diversity of personnel and scientific approaches, will allow us to make sustained
research progress over this MIRA award.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Environmental issues like exposure to air pollution or pesticides and their link with cancer development are at
the forefront of current public health research. Animals have long been recognized as sentinels for environmental
pollutants that can be hazardous for human health. Interestingly, and despite the fact that domestic animals like
horses and dogs share comparable habitats, and thus, are exposed to similar environmental risk factors as
humans, their susceptibility to develop certain types of cancer, like mammary cancer, differs greatly. The
overarching goal of this research is to use a comparative species approach to identify the responses of horses
(a species resistant to mammary cancer) and dogs (a species susceptible to mammary cancer) to environmental
carcinogens, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) that are linked with increased breast cancer risk.
Published work from our lab has shown that equine mammary cells undergo apoptosis while canine mammary
cells continue to proliferate when exposed to 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]-anthracene (DMBA), a synthetic PAH
derivate commonly used to induce mammary cancer in rodents. These data led to our hypothesis that mammary
cancer-proof mammals eliminate DNA-damaged cells through apoptosis, while damaged cells from mammary
cancer-susceptible mammals are repaired and persist, allowing for the accumulation of potential malignant
mutations. However, it is difficult to test this hypothesis in vivo due to logistical challenges of treating horses and
dogs with DMBA. To address this, we established a mammary xenograft model by transplanting mammary tissue
fragments from equine or canine donors into the cleared mammary fat pads of immunodeficient mice. We
confirmed that these transplanted tissue fragments are proliferative, hormone-responsive, and recapitulate the
architecture and function of the donor gland. We now propose to use this novel model to assess the effects of
DMBA on equine and canine mammary xenografts to further evaluate mammary cancer resistance and
susceptibility mechanisms in vivo. Following DMBA treatment, the mammary xenografts will be assessed for
histopathological features, DNA damage, and necrotic/mitotic rate. Activation of apoptotic and tumor-associated
pathways will be assessed using a spatial transcriptomics approach, which maintains spatial context of the tissue
while providing complete transcriptomic data. Successful outcome of this proposal will (i) improve our
understanding of histopathological responses of mammary glands from sentinel species to DMBA and (ii)
corroborate whether increased apoptosis is indeed a mechanism driving mammary cancer resistance in equine
mammary glands. Evaluation of this potentially conserved mechanism of mammary cancer resistance in
response to PAH exposure will help define important regulatory mechanisms that can ultimately result in the
identification of biomarkers of exposure and breast cancer risk.

Breast cancer accounts for nearly a quarter of all cancers in women and it remains the second leading cause of
cancer deaths in the US, despite substantial changes in standard of care treatments. Identifying evolutionary
mechanisms that naturally protect species from developing cancer is becoming an increasingly appreciated
approach to develop therapeutic strategies that are both efficient and non-toxic. We recently identified a cancer-
suppressing mechanism based on the secretion of bioactive factors with anti-cancer activity by mammary cells
(aka. mammosphere-derived epithelial cells or MDECs) from domesticated mammary cancer-proof mammals.
Specifically, these bioactive factors were shown to (i) induce triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell death,
without affecting normal human breast cells, in vitro and (ii) reduce tumorigenicity in a xenograft TNBC mouse
model in vivo. These findings led to our central hypothesis that the MDEC secretome from mammary cancer-
proof mammals has significant potential for the development of novel effective and non-toxic therapies to treat
and/or prevent breast cancer, especially the aggressive and hormone therapy-unresponsive TNBC. We now
propose to follow up on these interesting findings by further characterizing the anti-cancer activity of the MDEC
secretome in greater depth (Aim 1) and evaluating the therapeutic and/or preventative effects of the MDEC
secretome in mouse models of TNBC (Aim 2). The significance of this application lies in the novelty of the
approach being used to identify non-toxic efficient breast cancer therapeutic and/or preventative interventions
by focusing on bioactive anti-cancer factors produced by normal mammary cells from mammary cancer-proof
mammals. The proposed experiments will increase our knowledge of novel cancer-suppressing mechanisms
and will provide a solid basis for the design of effective and non-toxic therapies that can be used to fight
aggressive TNBC and/or for the development of protective factor-based therapeutics to eliminate or reduce
TNBC in high-risk populations.

The immunogenicity of nanomaterials is directly related to their performance and toxicity. However, there is still
a lack of systematic studies of how nanomaterials interact with the immune system. In this work, we will focus
on the immunogenicity of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs). Various studies have raised concerns about the adverse
event of LNPs from PEG lipids, ionizable lipids, and even helper phospholipids, such as anti-polyethylene glycol
(PEG) antibodies found in BioNTech/Pfizer and Moderna COVID vaccines. During our recent studies of LNP-
based mRNA cancer vaccines, the side effects, including ulcerative dermatitis, were also found on vaccinated
mice after subcutaneous administrations. Most studies of LNPs via screening or design today have mainly
focused on LNP efficacy while few on LNP immunogenicity. Very limited human data on very limited formulations
in the context of COVID-19 vaccines following intramuscular administration have very limited scope in
immunogenicity such as accessing the overall outcome of immunogenicity only. The investigations have not
extensively delved into the underlying causes of the widely reported adverse effects associated with LNP-based
mRNA vaccines, the specific immunological pathways of immunogenicity, and the underlying relationship
between immunogenicity and components of LNPs. Currently, the mechanism of how LNPs induce adverse
events is yet to be fully understood. Here we will formulate three libraries of LNPs covering widely used lipids
and vary chemical properties of each component. We will perform immunological assays on primary murine cells
to evaluate cytokine secretion and profile inducible gene expression. Similar tests will be performed in human
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (hPBMCs). Toll-like receptor (TLR) and NOD-like receptor (NLR)-dependent
immune response will be evaluated by reporter assays and validated in deficient mouse primary cells.
Furthermore, the immunogenicity of LNPs will be profiled in the setting of intramuscular injections by assessing
local inflammatory responses at the injection sites, and intravenous injections by evaluating the systemic
response including accelerated blood clearance effects. Through these studies, we will identify key components
that are responsible for LNP immunogenicity, understand how the chemistry of each LNP component alters the
level of immune activation, and discover any synergistic effects on the immunogenicity among the components.
The success of this work will advance current LNP technologies and provide clinical benefits for applications
from vaccines to therapeutics.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer and a leading cause of death worldwide. The degree
of CRC invasion into the large intestinal wall is associated with patient prognosis. White light endoscopy (WLE)
is used to evaluate lesions of interest within the colon, however WLE provides only morphological information,
often failing to efficiently evaluate the required resection margin or extent of tumor invasion. There is a significant
need to develop an endoscopic approach that can address these challenges. We believe this could be achieved
using spatially offset Raman spectroscopy (SORS) in combination with surface enhanced resonance Raman
scattering (SERRS) contrast agents (CAs). The combination of the two approaches is referred to as surface
enhanced spatially offset resonance Raman spectroscopy (SESORRS). In the proposed preclinical study, I will
test the hypothesis that SESORRS endoscopy could improve existing practices for the detection, staging and
surgical resection of CRC. During the K99 mentored phase, I will build and validate the efficiency of a SORS
endoscope using ex vivo phantoms (SA1.1, SA1.2). Using Apcfl/+ and Apcfl/+;KrasG12D/+ mouse models of CRC,
we will evaluate the efficiency of SESORRS endoscopy to detect and stage CRC in vivo. Results will be
correlated with MRI, PET, and ex vivo histology (SA2.1). The biodistribution and pharmacokinetic profiles of
radiolabeled SERRS CAs will be evaluated using PET imaging (SA2.2). As an independent investigator, I will
determine the optimal dose of SERRS CAs required for SORS endoscopic imaging of CRC (SA2.3). In SA3 I
will determine and validate the advantage of using molecularly targeted-SERRS CAs over non-targeted SERRS
CAs, together with the ability of SESORRS endoscopy to assist in the surgical resection of lesions of interest by
detecting residual tumor cells on the surface, and beneath, the resection bed. If successful, SESORRS
endoscopy could be very useful in the screening, diagnosis, and treatment of CRC. This project will enable us
to predict the potential success of clinical SESORRS endoscopy and increase the likelihood of achieving
eventual clinical translation. I have a unique set of expertise in SERRS, SORS and SESORRS imaging and
believe I am highly qualified to lead, and conduct, the proposed project here at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.
I also have identified the following key areas which require additional training in order to support my transition to
independence: (1) mouse models of CRC; (2) understanding the cancer biology of CRC and the influence of
genetic mutations on CRC invasion; (3) radiochemistry and PET imaging and; (4) requirements for clinical
translation. I have deliberately chosen and carefully assembled a world-class committee of mentors and advisors
including my primary mentor Dr. Kevin Haigis, as well as Dr. Conor L. Evans and Dr. Norman Nishioka who will
serve as co-mentors. My mentors are in full support of my research and career goals. I am committed to this
award and strongly believe that it will help me gain the necessary training required to enable my long-term career
goal of being an established investigator in the field of molecular imaging.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
 Genetic alterations in cancer cells can cause activation of regulatory factors that bind chromatin at target
gene loci to turn on transcription programs that drive tumor initiation and progression. However, despite
identification of these oncogenic regulatory factors in multiple tumor types, a gap in this rapidly evolving field is
the delineation of molecular mechanisms that open opportunities to target those regulators. Thus, my long-term
goal is to define interaction surfaces within chromatin-bound regulators critical for their oncogenic functions.
 In the F99 phase of this proposal I will focus on the transcription regulator KAP1 and its previously
unprecedented role in activating oncogenic WNT signaling in colorectal cancer (CRC). Despite the well-
established knowledge that WNT signaling drives CRC transformation and promotes tumor progression, a
therapeutic arm that successfully inactivates WNT in CRC has yet to be employed. Potentially addressing this
gap in knowledge, my studies have discovered that KAP1 is required for expression of WNT target genes in
response to oncogenic WNT stimulation. Importantly, compelling preliminary data support two non-mutually
exclusive mechanisms explaining how KAP1 may regulate WNT signaling. First, KAP1 could directly activate
WNT by scaffolding key transcriptional machinery to WNT target gene promoters using its chromatin reader
module. Second, KAP1 could interact with and regulate β-Catenin stability (the WNT transcription effector). I will
test these two models and then evaluate whether perturbing the KAP1–chromatin and/or KAP1–β-Catenin
interactions will block WNT-induced CRC phenotypes.
 In the K00 phase, I will shift focus to another biomedically relevant chromatin regulatory complex (SWI/SNF).
SWI/SNF normally remodels nucleosomes on chromatin to activate target gene expression, but its dysregulation
in cancer can cause aberrant activation of oncogenic programs. Likewise, in the soft-tissue malignancy Synovial
Sarcoma (SS), the transforming genetic alteration is translocation of SS18, a member of SWI/SNF, to the SSX
transcription factor. Because SSX, but not SSX18, normally binds modified nucleosomes, SSX abnormally
redirects SS18 to a cancer-specific set of genomic sites, causing upregulation of genes that promote
tumorigenesis. Despite this mechanistic understanding, the molecular and structural basis of the SS18-SSX–
nucleosome interaction remains unclear, and a strategy to target SS18-SSX is currently undefined. To achieve
these unmet needs, I will biophysically characterize the SS18-SSX-nucleosome interaction and then identify
small-molecule inhibitors that disrupt the SS18-SSX-nucleosome interaction. Finally, I will test lead inhibitor
candidates in hallmarks of cancer assays (proliferation and invasion).
 The training obtained under both phases will fulfill my long-term goal of running my own lab with an emphasis
on molecular mechanisms of gene regulation, allowing me to have a positive impact on cancer patients.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
Approximately 8,000 people in the U.S. are diagnosed with germ cell tumors (GCTs) each year, and the vast
majority are young men who develop testicular GCTs. Most patients are cured with conventional
chemotherapy, although 30% recur, and half of such patients ultimately succumb to their disease. Given the
long life expectancy of these patients, when death from GCT occurs, it accounts for among the greatest
number of life years lost of any non-childhood malignancy representing. Our previous studies have
demonstrated that GCTs exhibit an extreme burden of reciprocal loss of heterozygosity (RLOH) and high
degree of mitochondrial priming for apoptosis. The goal of this proposal is to dissect the molecular features
that initiate RLOH in GCTs, determine the relationship between RLOH and defect DNA checkpoints as tumors
progress, and evaluate the ability of functional assays to identify highest risk disease prior to chemotherapy
initiation. The long-term objective is to enable new mechanisms of patient stratification and identify new
therapeutic targets for chemoresistant GCTs, currently an area of unmet medical need with extremely limited
therapeutic options under investigation. This proposal is unique in that it leverages the extensive and novel
resources at both the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute/Harvard Cancer Center and the Broad Institute of MIT and
Harvard, along with an international team of collaborators, to overcome limited preclinical models of this
disease and incorporate patient-centered assays focused on human tumor samples to address the hypotheses
outlined herein. The proposed specific aims are: 1) To define the genetic defects associated with reciprocal
loss of heterozygosity in primary germ cell tumors, 2) To identify the molecular features of tumor evolution
leading to chemoresistant germ cell tumors, and 3) To assess the clinical utility of pluripotency markers as
prognostic for GCT outcomes. These studies will define the meiotic defects underlying RLOH in GCTs, identify
the secondary molecular defects that initiate lethal chemoresistance, and reveal targets for enhanced patient
stratification and therapeutic development. In addition, these efforts will accelerate development of new
computational algorithms that explore integrative molecular analyses of both the genome and epigenome to
address specific hypotheses regarding oncogenic development and progression to chemoresistance that may
have broad applicability. Finally, this project will accelerate the clinical and molecular characterization of GCTs,
explore the underlying biology driving this rare tumor type, and serve more broadly as an innovative model for
studying rare cancers.

Project Summary / Abstract
Now in its 22nd year of operation, Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center (DF/HCC) was the first consortium
model, NCI-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center. The consortium is comprised of 1,100 members from
five principal Harvard-affiliated hospitals and two Harvard health science schools: Beth Israel Deaconess
Medical Center (BIDMC), Boston Children’s Hospital (BCH), Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH), Dana-
Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI), Harvard Medical School (HMS), Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health
(HSPH), and Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH). Our overarching goals are to identify the genetic,
biological, environmental, and behavioral bases of cancer and to develop effective strategies to reduce risk
and improve preventive and treatment outcomes. Our catchment area is the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.
Our steady progress over the last two decades has depended on the combined resources and talent at the 7
institutions; the unique consortium structure that enables collaborative bench-to-bedside translational research
by population, basic, and clinical members; and well-coordinated Center leadership. DF/HCC embodies: 1) an
integrated structure that aspires to excellence in research and accelerates clinically effective discoveries, 2) a
cohesive research community for cross-institutional and transdisciplinary collaborations, and 3) a collectively
large patient population that expedites the conduct of innovative clinical trials. Our work occurs in 18 Research
Programs that cross scientific and institutional boundaries and span the gamut of population, basic, and clinical
cancer research; members excel in each sphere. Two entities, a Center for Cancer Equity and Engagement
(CCEE) and an Office for Cancer Research Education and Training (OCRET), help fulfill our responsibilities to
the catchment area and to train future leaders in cancer research. The Center supports 14 Shared Resources
that provide members with quality research services that cannot easily be duplicated in individual laboratories
or institutions. A unified clinical research infrastructure serves all seven consortium institutions and makes it
possible for members to conduct innovative early-phase (proof-of-concept and Phase I/II) clinical trials across
the consortium. A portfolio of grants that transcend organizational and disciplinary boundaries (e.g., SPOREs,
Program Projects, SU2C Dream Teams) reflect our collective translational and collaborative ideals.
Our next phase of work is guided by a multi-part Strategic Plan that emphasizes mechanistic understanding of
cancer, early cancer detection, equity, new therapeutic avenues, and a renewed commitment to education and
mentorship. Underlying these goals are a culture and infrastructure streamlined for collaborative investigation
of populations, fundamental cellular and molecular mechanisms, primary tumor specimens, and the barriers to
improved cancer-related outcomes in all segments of society.

 REV7/FANCV is a versatile DNA repair protein. It binds to REV3 in the Fanconi Anemia/BRCA
pathway, and it binds to SHLD3 in the NHEJ repair pathway. REV7 has at least one additional seatbelt-binding
partner, CHAMP1. CHAMP1 is a little-known but highly conserved zinc finger protein, first identified as a REV7
interactor. CHAMP1 localizes to chromosomes, recruits REV7 to spindles, and plays a role in kinetochore-
microtubule interactions. Germline heterozygous mutations in CHAMP1 are associated with a rare syndromic
form of intellectual disability and dysmorphic features in humans, with some cellular and clinical similarities to
Fanconi Anemia, though the relevance of this disease to FA has previously been unexplored. We have very
recently shown that the binding of CHAMP1 to REV7 promotes DSB end resection and HR repair (Li et al,
2022). The CHAMP1 protein binds to the seatbelt domain of REV7, thereby increasing Homologous
Recombination repair and competing with the binding of SHLD3 or REV3 to REV7. CHAMP1 is a component
of a large, multisubunit heterochromatin complex, containing CHAMP1, POGZ, and HP1α (the so-called
CHAMP1 complex). We have shown that patient-derived mutations in the CHAMP1 protein disrupt the
CHAMP1 complex and disrupt HR repair, leading to a characteristic phenotype and drug sensitivity of the
peripheral blood lymphocytes of CHAMP1 patients. Interestingly, we have now shown that the CHAMP1
complex accumulates at telomeres (i.e., critical concentrated sites heterochromatin) and maintains telomere
length via its HR activity. Although most human tumor cells rely on telomerase to maintain telomere length,
many other human tumors use the ALT (Alternative Lengthening of Telomeres) Pathway, an HR-driven
pathway, to maintain telomeres and to avoid replication senescence. Importantly, we have now shown that
ALT tumor cells depend on the HR activity of the CHAMP1 complex, providing a molecular basis of the
CHAMP1 syndrome. Knockdown of the CHAMP1 complex in ALT tumor cells results in accelerated telomere
shortening. Accordingly, the ALT pathway and the CHAMP1 complex are now highly attractive targets for
cancer therapy. The Specific Aims of the current application are to analyze the structure of the CHAMP1
complex and to determine its role in HR repair and Telomere Length Maintenance.

 Liquid biopsies have made significant strides in cancer medicine, with applications spanning early cancer
detection, assessment of therapy effectiveness and drug-resistance, monitoring tumor-dynamics and early
detection of minimal residual disease, MRD. Yet, substantial questions remain, prohibiting translation to clinical
practice on many occasions. For instance, the inability to detect tumor-circulating DNA (ctDNA) in a fraction of
gliomas, gastric and renal cancers, even for advanced stages, has led to the notion that some tumors are ‘non-
shedders’, thus postulating there are biological processes preventing some cancers from shedding DNA in the
blood. If true, this would prohibit the use of ctDNA as a tumor biomarker that precedes imaging and clinical
manifestation of disease. Similar questions apply to early-stage tumors that test negative for ctDNA, but patients
do experience clinical recurrence: was ctDNA never there or was it simply too low to be detected? Yet, improved
detection techniques applied to ‘non-shedder’ cancers have recently led to major increases in the ctDNA
detection rate, converting previously ctDNA-negative samples to positive. This indicates that possibly all cancers
shed DNA in the circulation, but some can only be detected with methods providing extremely high sensitivity.
 This R01 competing continuation builds on two technologies developed during the first grant cycle and
can address the questions. (a) MAESTRO -minor allele enriched sequencing through recognition
oligonucleotides- that enables extremely high sensitivity MRD detection. And (b) Duplex Repair (DR) that
reduces noise during subsequent duplex sequencing. We aim to show that the combined technology, DS-DR-
MAESTRO enables detection of ctDNA as sensitive as a single tumor-cell genome-equivalent circulating in the
~5l human blood pool at the time of blood collection, while retaining specificity. This sensitivity can be achieved
following sequencing of the primary tumor and collecting total circulating-DNA (cfDNA) typically recovered from
a standard 10-40ml blood collection. We will optimize the technology to the level required for subsequent
application in clinical studies. Aims 1-2 will optimize the technical aspects of the technology using serial dilutions
of cfDNA from tumor patients and normal volunteers. Aim 3 will apply the technology for detection of minimal
residual disease in circulating DNA from esophageal cancer patients whose tumors tend to shed very little ctDNA.
Successful technology development is anticipated to extend the use of cfDNA for detecting MRD in low-shedder
cancers and significantly shrink the size of cancers detectable. It will also increase the predictive power for
multiple endpoints, and assist pre/post-surgery ctDNA management decisions, thereby providing a window of
opportunity for many additional patients and improving precision medicine.

Development of covalent drugs for cancer therapy relies heavily on identifying the full spectrum of on- and off-
targets within the proteome, along with the specific site of inhibitor binding to each target. Currently we cannot
predict the set of targetable cysteines for a given inhibitor nor the potential for covalent labeling of off-target
proteins, which can lead to unintended toxicities. These limitations impede 'target discovery' during development
of new covalent inhibitors. Similarly, once a specific protein target has been identified as being selectively bound
by an inhibitor-candidate of interest, it is difficult to ascertain the fraction of target molecules in a cell or tissue
that are covalently bound by the compound ('target occupancy'). Target discovery and occupancy data can be
combined with toxicology and pharmacokinetic results to build more informative risk profiles to ensure that only
the most promising drug candidates are advanced and ultimately nominated for clinical trials.
The objective of our interdisciplinary team (Justin Kim, chemistry and chemical biology; Jarrod Marto, protein
biochemistry and chemical proteomics) is to synthesize and test first-generation reagents designed to advance
covalent inhibitor target discovery and target occupancy studies. Achieving our objectives will validate our
approach and pave the way for an intensive and iterative campaign of probe synthesis paired with
chemoproteomic analysis to systematically optimize our reagents. In the fullness of time we envision a complete
suite of chemoproteomic assay-specific reagents to facilitate target discovery and target occupancy studies.
Aim 1. To optimize new bioorthogonal reagents for proteome-wide inhibitor target identification. In this
aim we will further develop our bioorthogonal chemistry and rationally expand our library of alkylating scaffolds
suitable for cysteine profiling experiments. We will systematically assess the performance of our probes for target
discovery using recently characterized covalent inhibitors of kinases and deubiquitinating enzymes.
Aim 2. To develop multiplexed reporter probes to rapidly quantify covalent inhibitor target occupancy.
We will leverage selective fragmentation of our reporter probe scaffold to develop high-sensitivity, high-through-
put targeted mass spectrometry assays to quantify the occupancy of covalent inhibitors on their primary protein
target. We will carefully assess the performance of our cysteine alkylating probes as universal reagents for pull-
down-based (PD) target occupancy analysis, including linearity, accuracy, and limits of detection/quantification.
Successful completion of our objectives will provide an initial set of reagents with an extensible framework to
support future probe optimization campaigns by us and others in the field. Collectively the output of our program
will accelerate development of new covalent drugs for cancer therapy.

The durability of clinical responses to immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting PD1 has generated tremendous
interest in immunotherapy of cancers. However, not all patients demonstrate a complete or durable response
and thus, there is a need to develop additional therapeutic antibodies (mAbs) that target other immune pathways
and can be used in combination with anti-PD1 therapies. Though the majority of the focus to date has been on
other inhibitory pathways such as CTLA4 and TIGIT, recent developments have suggested a role for mAbs
targeting co-stimulatory receptors, allowing for the introduction of therapies that not only release the proverbial
brakes of the immune system, but also apply the gas to get the immune response moving. One such
costimulatory receptor is GITR (TNFRSF18), a TNFR superfamily member surface receptor that is upregulated
on activated T cells and endogenously expressed on both Tregs and NK, though basal expression on NK cells
is considerably lower. As with many stimulatory receptors, GITR requires receptor clustering to reach the
activation threshold for signal transduction and cellular activation and thus, many studies involving agonistic anti-
GITR antibodies failed to show a significant clinical benefit in humans. Though mutant antibody Fc domains have
been developed that enable spontaneous hexamerization upon cell surface binding, the hexamerization also
enhances C1q binding and complement deposition, leading to an immunodepleting molecule with potent effector
functions. To broaden the applications of this platform, our lab has used a structure guided engineering approach
to identify additional mutations that can abrogate C1q binding, leading to a hexamerizing antibody with negligible
effector functions and one that is suitable for targeting and activating stimulatory receptors. In vitro luciferase
based bioassays demonstrated that when combined with a hexamerizing Fc domain, our agonistic anti-GITR
antibody demonstrates significantly enhanced stimulation and a unique synergistic effect with GITR-Ligand. The
first aim of this proposal looks to examine the in vivo efficacy of this agonistic, hexamerizing anti-GITR antibody
with augmented stimulatory capabilities using an established and well characterized orthotopic renal cell
carcinoma model in a humanized mouse. Additionally, advanced analytical techniques including single cell RNA
sequencing, immunohistochemistry, and multiparameter FACS will enable the in-depth evaluation of the
mechanistic and cellular differences resulting from therapeutic use of hexamerizing antibodies targeting
stimulatory receptors. The second aim further advances the therapeutic potential of this antibody by engineering
and testing in vivo, a hexamerizing bispecific antibody that targets both GITR and PD1. This molecule will both
rescue exhausted immune cells and stimulate activated T cells, allowing for remodeling of the tumor
microenvironment and restoration of anti-tumor immunity. This proposal not only will evaluate the therapeutic
potential of a novel Fc domain and bispecific antibody, but also provide valuable insight into the mechanistic
differences resulting from enhanced receptor signaling and combination therapies.

The conference organizers are requesting support for convening the 2024 Symposium on the Immune System
of Bacteria. An explosion in discoveries explaining how bacterial cells defend against bacteriophage infection
has revolutionized the fields of immunology and microbiology and revealed a direct connection between bacterial
anti-phage defense and the mechanisms that control human antiviral immunity. The planned 2024 Symposium
on the Immune System of Bacteria will be the first to gather the forming international community in the US, and
will be crucial for establishing priority research directions in the field and training the next generation of young
US scientists in a rapidly emerging topic in contemporary microbiology. The topic of the planned symposium
perfectly aligns with NIAID's emphasis on fundamental microbiology, virology, and immunology research into the
mechanisms that control infectious diseases. The conference will convene a diverse panel of 19 invited speakers
that will present along with 15 early-career science speakers selected from submitted abstracts. Additionally, the
conference will have two poster sessions to highlight emerging research from PhD student and science trainees.
The 2024 Symposium on the Immune System of Bacteria will provide a unique opportunity to create a diverse
and inclusive environment and increase representation in the field. A particular emphasis of the conference is
highlighting the next generation of scientists in the field including early career stage scientists and new
investigators to bacterial immunity. Specific initiatives of the conference include a data presentation and live

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Project Summary
Inflammatory bowel disorders and necrotizing enterocolitis represent insufficient epithelial repair,
stemming from failure of proper maintenance and expansion of resident intestinal stem cells (ISCs).
ISCs are housed in invaginations called crypts that expand during development and repair after
damage in a process called crypt fission. Little is understood of how crypt fission is mediated, however,
signaling factors including BMP inhibitors and non-canonical Wnts are implicated. ISCs are regulated
and maintained by similar signaling factors secreted by a surrounding mesenchymal environment called
“the niche”. It is unclear what role the niche plays in mediating crypt fission. The niche is composed of a
myriad of different cell types, including PDGFRA+ intestinal subepithelial myofibroblasts (ISEMFs) and
smooth muscle, that are anatomically, molecularly, and functionally distinct. ISEMFs occur closest to
the epithelial-mesenchymal barrier, express both BMPs and non-canonical Wnts; smooth muscle
populations occur beneath crypts and express abundant BMP inhibitors. Preliminary data suggests that
signaling from both ISEMFs and smooth muscle is required for proper crypt fission. Smooth muscle
ablation reduces crypt fission during development; however, functional co-culture assays show limited
smooth muscle support of organoid growth in vitro. ISEMFs, on the other hand, promote different
organoid co-culture phenotypes depending on level of BMP inhibitor added: in low levels, ISEMFs
promote differentiation, and in high levels, promote increased crypt budding, aka fission. My hypothesis
is that crypt fission is a process coordinated by the signaling activities of both ISEMFs and smooth
muscle. In Aim 1, I will investigate the anatomical and functional profiles of ISEMFs and smooth
muscle in crypt fission. I will determine when these cells occur during instances of crypt fission,
including postnatal development and repair after damage, test the requirement of ISEMFs in promoting
crypt fission in vivo, and sufficiency of ISEMFs and smooth muscle in directing crypt fission in vitro. In
Aim 2, I will test whether ISEMFs direct crypt fission via non-canonical Wnt signaling. Using both
in vitro and in vivo methods, I will determine the specific function of ISEMFs in directing crypt fission via
non-canonical Wnt5a. Together, these studies will provide fundamental insights into the collective
regulation of crypt fission via distinct mesenchymal niche populations during development and epithelial
repair, aiding our understanding of fundamental intestinal biology and disease.

There is a fundamental gap in our understanding of how mutations in the cohesin complex, a multimeric protein
complex essential for sister chromatid cohesion, chromatin organization into loops and gene regulation, cause
myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Continued existence of this gap represents an important problem because
despite the high frequency of cohesin mutations in MDS and its association with high risk of disease and poor
outcomes, there are currently no treatment strategies to specifically target cohesin-mutant cells in MDS. STAG2
mutations are mutually exclusive with mutations in the splicing factor SF3B1, the most commonly mutated gene
in MDS. Furthermore, cohesin proteins have been shown to bind SF3 splicing factors and RNA binding proteins
(RBPs) and are dependent on normal spliceosome function for their survival. New genetically engineered models
of cohesin-mutant MDS offer a unique opportunity to test the contribution of disease alleles to splicing
abnormalities and therapeutic response, and to dissect the interaction between the cohesin and splicing
complexes. The long-term goal is to improve outcomes in cohesin-mutant MDS by deeper mechanistic
understanding of disease biology. The overall objective of this application is to determine why splicing is a genetic
dependency in cohesin-mutant MDS. The central hypothesis is that an RNA-mediated interaction between
cohesin and splicing complexes is disrupted in cohesin-mutant MDS and leads to splicing deregulation and
dependency of cohesin-mutant cells on proper splicing, which can be exploited therapeutically. Guided by strong
preliminary data from the applicant’s laboratory, the hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific aims: 1)
Determine the splicing changes and the effect of splicing modulation on STAG2-mutant MDS; and 2) Dissect the
interaction between the cohesin complex and the SF3B splicing complex. Under the first Aim, the applicant will
characterize transcriptional and splicing changes in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells of a novel genetic
murine model of progression from Tet2-mutant clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) to
Tet2/Stag2-mutant MDS. They will also test the effect of splicing modulation on MDS progression in vivo and
using cohesin-mutant MDS patient samples. Under the second Aim, a combination of transcriptomic and cross-
linking and immunoprecipitation experiments will be used in several well established in vitro models to identify
specific RNA species that mediate the interaction between the cohesin and splicing complexes. The approach
is innovative through the application of novel murine models. The downstream effects of the interaction between
cohesin and splicing and its disruption in cohesin-mutant MDS have not been clarified, and the mechanisms
driving splicing dependency in cohesin-mutant cells are unknown. The proposed research is significant, because
it is expected to define the biological role of cohesin mutations in a high-risk subset of MDS associated with poor
outcomes. The expected output for the proposed research is that the knowledge gained will be immediately
clinically significant for patients with cohesin-mutant MDS and inform new treatment strategies.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
For decades, researchers have used the log-rank test/Cox's hazard ratio (HR) test/estimation approach as the
standard primary analysis for clinical trials with time-to-event outcomes. The statistical significance test based
on the log-rank or HR-based test statistic offers a dichotomous decision about the superiority of one treatment
over another to support the regulatory approval of new drugs or define the standard of care in a population.
However, patients and clinicians often need additional information to make value-driven treatment decisions,
including the magnitude of risks and benefits of the treatments they are considering. Despite its common use,
the HR does not provide robust, reliable, and clinically interpretable quantitative information about the risks and
benefits of a new treatment; new analytic methods are needed to inform patient-centered cancer treatment
decisions. Our team recently developed a novel two-sample comparison method that has the potential to
change the traditional analytic practice and significantly improve the interpretation of the magnitude of
treatment effect on time-to-event outcomes. The new method utilizes the "average hazard" (AH) --- a new
summary measure of the event time distribution, with three main advantages over alternative methods. First,
the AH can be estimated nonparametrically and has a clear interpretation as the general Censoring-Free
person-time Incidence Rate (gCFIR). Second, it provides treatment effect estimates in both absolute difference
and relative terms, which increases the likelihood that clinicians, clinical trialists, and patients can understand
the treatment effect magnitude correctly. Third, since the between-group treatment effect summaries provided
by this method consist of "hazards", it would be more likely to be accepted in practice than existing alternative
methods by clinical researchers accustomed to Cox's "hazard" ratio. The proposed study aims to establish the
gCFIR approach for use as the primary analysis for treatment risk and benefit estimation and disseminate it to
the clinical research community. In Aim 1, we will develop the following methods that are indispensable for this
approach to be employed as the primary analysis in practice: 1) regression analysis, 2) interim analysis, 3)
adjusted analysis, 4) analysis for competing risks, and 5) analysis for observational studies. In Aim 2, we will
develop dissemination materials, including implementation software, a user-friendly guide with vignettes, and
short video clips. We will provide clinicians and clinical trialists with free webinar courses. The overarching goal
of this work is to use novel analytic methods to enhance communication and clinical interpretability of research
findings, thereby facilitating translation of scientific results from clinical research into clinical practice. Ultimately,
the proposed project can support informed conversations about treatment options between clinicians and
patients.

The goal of this proposal is to develop a comprehensive understanding of the scope and key drivers of racial
and ethnic disparities in opioid management across the cancer care trajectory, and to use this understanding to
design a multi-level cancer pain equity intervention for future testing. Pain is a common and disabling symptom
of cancer, affecting half of patients on treatment, one third of survivors, and over two thirds of those with
advanced disease. Despite their risks, opioids remain a cornerstone of managing cancer pain. Cancer patients
of color receive less potent analgesics than White patients, and consequently experience more severe and
debilitating pain. Yet, there have been few population-based studies of opioid inequities among cancer
populations and much remains unknown about its magnitude and scope, the patients and communities most
affected, and the relative influence of physician, practice, health system, and neighborhood factors.
In preliminary work examining over 300,000 Medicare beneficiaries with poor prognosis cancers, we found that
Black and Hispanic patients received fewer and less potent opioids than White patients, and Black patients
were more likely to undergo urine drug screening near the end-of-life. Disparities disproportionately affected
Black men and those living in urban areas, underscoring the need to better understand the neighborhood
factors and subpopulations most impacted. Here we propose a comprehensive analysis of inequities in opioid
management among Black, Hispanic, Asian, and non-Hispanic White Medicare and Medicaid-insured patients
across the post-operative, active treatment, survivorship, and end-of-life phases of cancer care. By linking
administrative data to comprehensive information about physicians, practices, health systems, and
neighborhoods, we will examine racial variation across versus within these levels, elucidating key mechanisms
by which racism undermines equitable pain management. The project will be informed by an explicitly anti-
racism framework, led by a team with expertise in multilevel analyses of healthcare quality and equity, and
guided by longitudinal engagement of patient stakeholders belonging to communities of color.
After identifying the populations and settings at greatest risk, and the chief drivers of opioid inequities, we will
use a rigorous 4-phase research process to design a multi-level cancer pain equity intervention targeting the
most potent and mutable drivers, and the clinical settings with greatest need. This process will be grounded in
a multilevel model based upon the Racism as a Fundamental Cause of Inequalities in Health and guided by
qualitative feedback from cancer patients and caregivers of color, and from clinicians, staff and organizational
leaders from diverse cancer care systems. This proposal will yield a comprehensive understanding of the
scope and root causes of racial inequities in cancer pain management, and a trial-ready intervention that
addresses strategic sources of inequities at multiple levels. Our findings will also have clear implications for
policy makers, insurers, and health systems leaders committed to providing equitable care for cancer patients.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Summary
Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a highly aggressive skin cancer with an incidence of 3,000 USA cases/year.
MCC carries a 2-year mortality of 40% with clear unmet medical need. Majority (65%) of MCC are virus-positive.
The Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV) is the main driver of virus-positive MCC tumors. Viral T antigens are
highly immunogenic because they are foreign to the immune system. Viral positive MCC can thus be an ideal
setting to develop targeted immunotherapies including cancer vaccines. Several challenges confront our
ability to develop a T cell-based MCC vaccine; i) the lack of knowledge of conserved immunogenic MCPyV-
derived T cell epitopes that bind to diverse human HLA alleles to provide immunity; ii) the lack of a vaccine
platform for generating persistent memory T cells against cancer cells. To overcome these barriers, I have led
efforts for immunopeptidome analysis, leading to the generation of monoallelic class I expressing cell lines
across 95 different HLA alleles. Using this resource, we identified >185,000 HLA class I-binding peptides, from
which we trained highly accurate epitope prediction algorithms (HLAthena) 6,7. We developed robust protocols
to establish patient-derived MCC lines; application of HLAthena to these lines has yielded new MCPyV epitopes,
which we confirmed by LC-MS/MS analysis (Lee JCI, in press). Finally, in collaboration with Dr. Moon we
developed lipid nanodisc immunization to target professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs) that are capable
of raising mucosal memory CD8 T cells to reject tumors.8 We hypothesize that cancer-driving MCPyV viral
antigens can yield highly immunogenic epitopes. We expect that such knowledge can fuel the development
of an effective off-the-shelf cancer vaccine against MCC. Our aims are thus to:Aim 1. Systematically determine
class I presented MCPyV epitopes across human HLA alleles that could provide global population
coverage for a T cell-based cancer vaccine. We have generated 95 single HLA allele-expressing B721.221
cell lines that provide global HLA coverage 7. We will transfect MCPyV LT and ST and seek to identify class I
HLA-presented MCPyV epitopes by LC-MS/MS analysis. We will also predict epitopes using HLAthena. Epitopes
identified from the MS analysis and predictions will be further analyzed to identify conserved promiscuous
epitopes which could be candidates for a universal off-the-shelf T cell-based MCPyV vaccine.Aim 2. Confirm
the immunogenicity of the candidate MCPyV epitopes. Immunogenic validation and characterization of
MCPyV epitopes will enable the discovery of candidate protective MCC-reactive T cell epitopes. We will utilize
already banked HLA typed naïve and MCC patient human PBMCs in these studies to determine T cell immune
memory, de-novo T cell responses, TCR avidity, and cytotoxic activity against MCC tumor cell lines. Aim 3. Test
the impact of T cell-based therapies directed against MCPyV in in vivo models. We will devise multi-epitope
vaccines using the nanodisc platform. These candidate MCPyV-targeting vaccines will be tested in MCC GEM
model for tumor control. We will further characterize MCC GEM model tumor microenvironment +/- vaccine.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
Germline pathogenic mutations and common variants have been implicated in the development of clear cell
renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). Similarly, recurrent somatic alterations are key to ccRCC pathogenesis and
distinct clinical states. Combinations of germline and somatic mutations can directly interact to disrupt the same
gene in ccRCC, traditionally exemplified by biallelic pathogenic coding mutations in VHL. Novel combinations of
different genes and alteration types in germline and somatic genomes may also contribute to pathogenesis and
clinical states (“convergence”); however, studying these relationships remains a major challenge for the cancer
genetics field. For example, the expanding scope of germline and somatic events in noncoding regions, most of
which have uncertain functional impact, significantly complicates discovery of genes that dysregulate convergent
biological processes. Additionally, whether related germline and somatic events promote tumor heterogeneity,
which may also impact clinical outcomes, is largely unknown and historically difficult to study given the lack of
appropriate methodologies and cohorts. Finally, certain germline and somatic alteration types (e.g. structural
variants) remain poorly understood in ccRCC, but determination of their impact on actionable genes is necessary
to maximize precision oncology approaches. Our team has developed strategies to overcome these significant
challenges, and our subsequent preliminary findings indicate that ccRCC exhibits previously unappreciated
forms of convergence. These include combinations of germline and somatic events that: (i) alter transcriptional
states of biologically related genes through noncoding variation; (ii) impact chromatin regulatory complexes to
result in clinically relevant histologic heterogeneity; and (iii) indirectly disrupt actionable genes through novel
structural mechanisms. Broadly, hypothesis-driven investigations of these unconventional germline and somatic
relationships may inform how they promote ccRCC pathogenesis, unique histopathologic states, and distinct
clinical outcomes. Building on our extensive preliminary data and longstanding expertise in computational and
functional cancer genomics, the overarching hypothesis of this project is that novel biologically convergent
germline and somatic alterations contribute to ccRCC pathogenesis, and these convergent properties jointly
shape tumor heterogeneity and clinical states. We will evaluate this hypothesis through the following independent
Specific Aims: 1) Determine the convergent germline and somatic noncoding events that contribute to
oncogenesis; 2) Define the germline and somatic alterations that jointly influence clinically relevant spatial
heterogeneity; and 3) Dissect the clinical actionability of germline and somatic structural variants in inclusive
cohorts. This hypothesis-driven proposal will reveal relationships between germline and somatic events, tumor
heterogeneity, and clinical actionability in ccRCC via a suite of innovative cross-disciplinary approaches. Overall,
this proposal will enable a new understanding of how germline and somatic genomes jointly shape tumor initiation
and evolution in ccRCC, and potentially across cancers.

producing CD11c+ microglia has divided Disease-Associated Microglia (DAM) that surround Aβ plaques into two
opposing subsets that together regulate AD pathology. A pathogenic CD11c+OPN+ microglial subset promotes
proinflammatory responses and drives AD development, and a protective CD11c+OPN− microglial subset
degrades Aβ fibrils and inhibits disease pathology. We find that genetic deletion of OPN (a) inhibits microglial
proinflammatory responses, (b) enhances TREM2/TAM-dependent uptake and lysosomal breakdown of Aβ
plaques and (c) markedly improves cognitive function. Analyses of clinically and neuropathologically
characterized brain tissue from AD patients and controls (Mt. Sinai Brain Bank and the Rush Alzheimer’s Disease
Study) confirm these murine findings. In addition, administration of α-OPN mAb markedly ameliorates the
microglial proinflammatory responses and reduces Aβ plaques in 5XFAD mice.
Here we propose Osteopontin (OPN) as a novel and tractable target based on preclinical studies of the 5XFAD
model of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) (performed at DFCI) and analysis of well-characterized human brain tissue
(performed at Mt. Sinai and Rush Alzheimer’s Disease Center) (Aims 1 and 2). We also test the therapeutic
impact of mAb-based approaches that target OPN in the 5XFAD mouse model in Aim 3. The overarching goal
of our therapeutic approaches is conversion of proinflammatory microglia into a non-inflammatory phenotype
with enhanced ability to engulf and digest Aβ fibrils. Identification of a pathogenic (CD11c+OPN+) microglial
subset in both murine and human brain tissue provides new insight into the pathogenic pathway that may drive
clinical AD and a foundation for the development of therapeutics that target this pathology and halt or reverse
disease progression.

Overview: 1.8 million people die of lung cancer each year across the globe. Immunotherapy, particularly using
immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), has revolutionized lung cancer treatments over the last years projecting a
significant improvement in cancer prognosis; however, response rates of ICIs are only 15-25%, which is in part
due to the lower levels of functional immune cells and insufficient infiltration of immune cells into the tumor.
Furthermore, about 70% of patients with NSCLC receiving ICIs experience immunotherapy-related adverse
events (irAEs) (e.g., metabolic dysregulation, myalgia, and cardiopulmonary disease). An effective intervention
that can enhance treatment responses as well as ameliorate irAEs would be a significant advance in clinical care
for patients with NSCLC on ICIs. Exercise has been emerging as a novel approach that can enhance response
to immunotherapy and reduce irAEs. Exercise can increase the infiltration of neutrophils in the target cells and
circulating levels of T cells and NK cells as well as induce tumor angiogenesis in preclinical settings, which has
the potential to induce a better response to ICIs and cancer suppression. Furthermore, exercise is proven to be
feasible in patients with lung cancer and to increase cardiopulmonary/muscular fitness and metabolic regulation,
which also suggests the potential benefits of exercise to reduce irAEs. However, no exercise clinical studies, to
date, have been conducted in patients with lung cancer receiving ICIs. Also, it is unclear which exercise
prescription, particularly regarding exercise intensity, would yield better immunological and treatment-related
outcomes. Therefore, I propose multi-level clinical research where a pilot randomized clinical trial (K99) will
explore the preliminary efficacy and mechanisms of different exercise training on immune function, which will
inform a larger Phase II trial (R00) to examine the effects of exercise on immunotherapy response rate and irAEs.
Research Plan: The K99 study is a three-arm pilot randomized clinical trial that will compare high-intensity
interval training (HIIT) vs. moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT) vs. usual care (UC) to explore the
preliminary efficacy of exercise on immune function (Aim 1) and provide a proof-of-concept of the mechanisms
by analyzing biomarkers of immune function, exercise-induced cytokines, and cancer progression (Aim 2). These
findings will inform the R00 study, which is a two-arm phase II randomized clinical trial to examine the effects of
exercise (most efficacious training from K99) on immune function (Aim 3a), tumor biomarkers (Aim 3b), and
immunotherapy response and irAEs (Aim 3c).
Career Development Plan: The proposed comprehensive and transdisciplinary training, involving coursework,
mentorship, research involvement, and seminars/meetings, will enable me to (1) obtain the fundamental
expertise necessary to comprehend the roles of exercise in lung cancer immunotherapy and (2) become an
independent researcher who will lead a research group to pioneer the field of ‘Exercise Immuno-Oncology’.

 Most applications of genomics in modern oncology focus on somatic mutations acquired during tumor
evolution and selecting drugs to target these tumor-specific mutations. While effective, these approaches usually
do not consider the broader context of a patient’s inherited (i.e., germline) genetics, which is a major source of
cancer risk that can modify the effects of somatic mutations and alter therapeutic responses. This focus on
somatic mutations is also a major limitation for cancers driven by the RAS oncogene family, which are recalcitrant
to virtually all targeted therapies. Somatic RAS alterations are common in many cancers—especially pancreatic,
colorectal, skin, and lung tumors (hereafter: “RAS-driven cancers”)—but are difficult to inhibit pharmacologically.
These cancers comprise 39% of all cancer-related deaths in the USA each year, many of which could be
prevented if their cancers were intercepted at earlier stages. This reflects an urgent opportunity to reduce cancer-
related mortality by unifying germline and somatic genetics to prioritize high-risk individuals for screening or early
intervention and to identify novel targets for therapeutic development. In this proposal, I outline a strategy to
dissect the impact of germline genetics in RAS-driven cancers. During the K99 phase, I will discover germline
factors that modify RAS oncogenicity in a unique collection of somatic, germline, clinical, and/or transcriptomic
data for >35,000 individuals. During the R00 phase, I will nucleate an independent research program around a
comprehensive computational framework for the genome-wide detection of germline risk factors for cancer
spanning the full spectrum of variation accessible to genome sequencing, with an emphasis on understudied
classes of variation like structural and rare noncoding variants. I will apply this method to systematically map
genetic risk factors for RAS-driven cancers in a diverse set of >10,200 patients and >17,100 cancer-free controls.
 My long-term career goal is to usher in a new era of preventative precision oncology by unlocking the
potential of human genomics to illuminate the heritable causes of cancer initiation and progression. My mentors
and I have developed a comprehensive training plan in cancer biology and medical oncology for my K99 phase
that will prepare me to launch a successful independent career at the intersection of genomics, cancer, and data
science in the R00 phase. My postdoctoral training will be supervised Dr. Eliezer Van Allen, who is a world-
leader in computational oncology. I will also benefit from the complementary expertise of two co-mentors in Drs.
Alexander Gusev (statistics) and Kevin Haigis (RAS biology), who will buttress Dr. Van Allen’s mentorship and
ensure I build a well-rounded skillset during the mentored K99 phase to lay the foundation for a highly productive
independent R00 phase. Finally, my proposed research plan will be facilitated by the outstanding scientific
environment at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, which is the ideal ecosystem to support my postdoctoral phase.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：RPL3L, or ribosomal protein L3-like, is a highly conserved, vertebrate-specific duplicated paralog of the
ubiquitous ribosomal protein L3 (RPL3). While most ribosomal protein gene duplications are silent pseudogenes,
RPL3L is highly and exclusively expressed in adult striated muscle and is the predominant form in cardiac (~95%)
and skeletal (~60%) muscle. Such a tissue-specific paralog switching is intriguing especially given that striated
muscle comprise ~50% of body weight and 50-75% of all body protein, and that RPL3 is one of the most
important ribosomal proteins: it is the closest protein to ribosome catalytic center, functions as a gatekeeper to
the decoding center, and is required for the first step of 60S subunit assembly. Furthermore, the development-
and tissue-specific RPL3-to-RPL3L switch is reversed during muscle growth when the demand for protein
synthesis is high. We and others recently reported bi-allelic heterozygous missense mutations in RPL3L co-
segregating with severe neonatal dilated cardiomyopathy and fatal heart failure in five unrelated families. Despite
the evolutionary, physiological and pathological significance, it remains unclear why the genetic code in half of
human body mass is interpreted by ribosomes differ by a key component, i.e., RPL3 vs. RPL3L, in a highly
regulated manner. The mechanistic details of whether and how RPL3L ribosomes function differently from
ubiquitous RPL3 ribosomes remains poorly understood, due in part to the lack of in vitro and in vivo systems
where the relative expression of RPL3 and RPL3L are perturbed. To address this barrier, we have generated
human cell lines and mouse models predominantly expressing either RPL3 or RPL3L in cardiomyocytes. Our
preliminary results support a model that RPL3L ribosomes promote protein homeostasis in striated muscle cells.
We will use a combination of biochemical, imaging, genomics, and computational approaches to test our
hypothesis. By answering the long-standing question of why the heart needs a special ribosome, our study will
reveal how heart functions at the molecular and cellular level and establish a new paradigm for how ribosomes
specialize in tissues. From the disease perspective, our study may shed lights on the pathogenesis of dilated
cardiomyopathy and lay the foundation for the development of new therapies.

Bioprosthetic heart valves (BHV), made from glutaraldehyde-fixed xenografts, are widely used for surgical
(SAVR) and transcatheter valve interventions (TAVR), but suffer from limited durability due to Structural Valve
Degeneration (SVD). Advances in BHV device engineering and delivery have created the possibility to provide
state-of-the-art care to heart valve disease patients that were once deemed inoperable due to their risk score
and advanced co-morbidities. However, the same class of devices is offered to all patients, irrespectively of their
co-morbidities and susceptibility to structural valve degeneration. Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a common
comorbidity in patients who require BHV and is a known risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. Our published
and preliminary results show the enhanced susceptibility of bio-implantable materials to oxidation, glycation, pro-
calcific proteins, and crosslinkers in patients with Metabolic Syndrome or rodent model of MetS, using Zucker
Diabetic Fatty (ZDF, Obese fa/fa). We have also shown that poly-2-methyl-2-oxazoline (POZ) functionalization
of clinically graded BHVs and bovine pericardium mitigates SVD by reducing protein absorption, decreasing
glycation, and oxidation products accumulation, and enhancing thromboresistance. Notably, POZ
functionalization reduces calcification using human serum-incubation assays and subcutaneous implants in ZDF
rats. In MetS patients, both surgical (SAVR) and percutaneous (TAVR) approaches are valid treatment options,
although some recent studies raise the possibility that, in the long term SAVR could exhibit higher survival rates.
Finally, given their conditions, MetS patients are often pharmacologically treated to control hyperglycemia and
high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Therefore, SVD - in the clinical setting of Metabolic Syndrome - is driven by
three main factors: a) the biochemical profile of the patients, b) device selection and the susceptibility of the
implanted material to degradation, and c) the pharmacological treatments that MetS patients are receiving. This
application will address these three aspects and test the hypothesis that a combination of POZ-modified surgical
or transcatheter bioprosthetic valve and pharmacological management of MetS is needed to mitigate SVD and
improve durability. Once completed, the expected outcomes are to identify the main driving factors responsible
for the accelerated structural degeneration and calcification of implantable materials in patients with MetS.

Atherothrombotic cardiovascular disease (ACD) remains the major cause of morbidity and
mortality in the US. Increased number and activation of neutrophils and eosinophils are
associated with increased risk of ACD. The underlying mechanisms of these associations are
incompletely understood, and no therapies specifically address these risk factors. Human GWAS
have unraveled association of a common polymorphism of LNK/SH2B3 (T allele, R262W) with an
increased risk of ACD and increased neutrophil, platelet and eosinophil counts. This LNK variant
is carried by ~75% European, ~50% Latin American and ~30% African American populations. We
have shown that LNK(R262W) reduces LNK function and LNK deficiency in blood cells promotes
atherosclerosis in mouse models. More recently, we have shown that enhanced neutrophil
extracellular trap formation promotes atherothrombosis in Lnk-/- mice. Mechanistically, activated
LNK deficient platelets present increased oxidized phospholipids, priming neutrophils for NETosis.
While eosinophils represent a small fraction of white blood cells, there is accumulating evidence
that they play an important role in thrombosis and atherosclerosis. We have preliminary data
showing prominent eosinophilia and reversal of accelerated thrombosis in Lnk-/- mice by antibody
mediated eosinophil depletion. The preliminary data suggests a major role of eosinophils in
eosinophil, neutrophil and platelet interactions that promotes thrombosis in hematopoietic Lnk-/-
mice. The broad goal of this project is to investigate mechanisms connecting LNK deficiency to
atherosclerosis and thrombosis. A major new hypothesis is that hematopoietic LNK deficiency
promotes arterial thrombosis, plaque erosion and atherosclerosis at least in part via increased
eosinophil production, eosinophil activation and interaction with platelets and neutrophils. In this
proposal, we will follow the leads and generate novel mouse models including a mouse line with
floxed Lnk to explore the mechanisms underlying the role of eosinophils in atherosclerosis and
atherothrombosis in hematopoietic LNK deficiency. A better understanding of these mechanisms
may lead to development of new therapeutic approaches to managing ACD risks, probably in
populations with defined genetic background, e.g. LNK(R262W) polymorphism.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY - Nearly half of the U.S. population sometimes or always experiences loneliness.
This is alarming, in part, because loneliness confers risk for negative mental and physical health outcomes.
Extensive research suggests loneliness is characterized by subjective isolation: many lonely individuals maintain
a number of relationships but still report feeling lonely. Thus, a neurobiological account of loneliness requires
that we understand how the brain represents our subjective connections to others and how loneliness alters
these representations. The long-term goal of this proposal is to identify how subjective isolation is represented
in the brain in order to identify novel ways to intervene on this representation to attenuate loneliness. We propose
that medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) and posterior cingulate (PC), which comprise a functional network in the
brain, organize our representations of people based on our subjective connection to them and that loneliness
systematically alters this organization. In Specific Aim 1, we will determine whether subjective closeness
organizes self and other representations in MPFC/PC. While undergoing fMRI, participants will complete tasks
in which they reflect on their own and other people’s personalities and mental states. They will also report on
their subjective closeness, similarity, and familiarity to the other people. Representational similarity analysis
(RSA) will test 1) whether the brain organizes mental representations of the self and one’s own social network
members based on subjective closeness and 2) whether the subjective closeness model better explains the
organization of self and other representations than the alternative possibilities of perceived similarity, familiarity,
or trait-dimensions. In Specific Aim 2, we will determine how loneliness modulates self and other representations
in MPFC/PC. We predict that trait loneliness corresponds with MPFC/PC patterns reflecting 1) greater
differentiation between self and others and/or 2) less differentiation between close others and acquaintances.
Individual difference measures that are related, but non-redundant, with loneliness (i.e., self-esteem, depression)
will also be collected to isolate the specificity of our findings to loneliness. In Specific, Exploratory Aim 3, we will
determine the cognitive consequences of altered self and other representation in loneliness. Participants will
also complete fMRI tasks designed to test novel hypotheses generated by our pilot data regarding the
neurocognitive processes altered by loneliness. Participants will be asked to judge the interpersonal closeness
and similarity in personalities between self and social network members. We predict that loneliness will be
associated with exaggerating the difference between self and other personalities while also overgeneralizing the
similarity of other people’s personalities, both of which will be underpinned by aberrant responses in MPFC,
given its role in person-knowledge and/or 2) difficulty judging the interpersonal distance between other people,
underpinned by aberrant responses in PC, given its role in processing interpersonal distance. Our proposal is
imperative for ultimately revealing neurocognitive mechanisms to intervene on to reduce loneliness.

The proposed research program aims to develop innovative computational tools for the analysis and
integration of data from emerging spatially-resolved genomic technologies, which have the potential to uncover
the role of interactions with the environment in normal development and disease. Existing analytical tools for
analyzing spatial omics data are limited in their interpretability and are not capable of integrating multi-modal
data.
Leveraging our extensive experience in computational modeling of single-cell data as another
high-dimensional genomic data type, we will design machine learning frameworks in the form of probabilistic
and deep generative models to tackle the analytical challenges of spatially-resolved genomic data and
importantly integrate multiple data modalities. This framework will enable the identification of neighborhood
patterns defined as regions with a unique composition of cell states, from the integration of spatial profiling of
mRNAs, proteins, and histological imaging (Aim 1). We will build on a foundation of modeling gene regulatory
networks to develop the first computational tool for inferring spatially-varying regulation from the integration of
spatial ATAC-seq and RNA-seq (Aim 2). Additionally, we will develop a computational tool for inferring the
spatial distribution of cells with distinct copy number profiles, and their associated gene programs (Aim 3).
We highlight the versatility and generalizability of our computational methods by applying our techniques in
multiple biological systems with our collaborators. These applications will provide novel insights in
understanding the basis of spatial patterns in human and mouse embryonic development, brain organoid
models, as well as disease systems such as neuropsychiatric disorders, glioblastoma and breast cancer. Our
goal is to disseminate our computational toolbox as open-source software to the broader genomics community
to unlock novel insights about the spatial organization of cell types, their interactions, and mechanisms in
various biological systems.

Gene expression is tightly controlled at both the RNA and protein level by mechanisms involving chromatin
modification, transcriptional regulation, mRNA splicing, processing, translation and degradation. Each of these
processes are regulated by nucleic acid-protein interactions (DNA-protein and RNA-protein). Accordingly, there
have been tremendous efforts in the scientific community to comprehensively map these interactions, including
major international research efforts (e.g. ENCODE, RoadMap Epigenomics) focused on generating reference
maps for specific cell types. However, because these binding maps are highly specific for individual cell types,
there is a critical need to enable the generation of comprehensive genomic maps for any cell type of interest –
including primary cell types, disease models, or other rare cell populations – within an individual lab. This goal
remains challenging because existing assays can only map interactions of a single protein at a time and are
therefore prohibitively expensive.
To address these issues, this proposal will develop a highly innovative technology based on our split-pool
barcoding strategy (SPRITE) that maps multiway protein-nucleic acid interactions using high throughput
sequencing. The proposed Hi-P technology will be used to establish: (i) a highly multiplexed eCLIP-seq method
to map up to hundreds of RNA binding proteins simultaneously to their RNA binding sites, (ii) a highly multiplexed
ChIP-seq method to map up to hundreds of DNA binding proteins and histone modifications to their DNA binding
sites, and (iii) methods to map these multiple protein-nucleic acid interactions across many samples, among
these rare cell types, simultaneously.
The proposed technology represents a major advance – it will dramatically increase the scale of existing methods
and create new capabilities that are currently not possible. These tools will empower individual researchers to
generate detailed genomic datasets in specific biological and disease contexts that are comparable in size and
complexity to those generated by the ENCODE project at a tiny fraction of its cost. More generally, we anticipate
that these tools will lead to critical new insights into gene regulation and human disease.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
Meiotic recombination is a fundamental genetic and evolutionary process, initiated by the
deliberate infliction of numerous double strand breaks (DSBs) on the genome. In most mammals,
these DSBs are specified by PRDM9, which binds DNA through a zinc finger (ZF) array and
makes two histone modifications that together serve to recruit the DSB machinery. In these
species, the ZF binding affinity is rapidly-evolving. Intriguingly, PRDM9 is not only found in
mammals but throughout vertebrates, and may be directing meiotic recombination there too.
Despite its broad phylogenetic distribution, the gene has been lost independently many times; in
these cases, the determinants of DSB location are less well understood but are associated with
promoter features. We propose four analyses that address these gaps in our understanding: Aim
1. Do non-mammalian species with an intact PRDM9 use it to direct recombination? We will test
this hypothesis in corn snakes, a vertebrate species that carries a complete and rapidly-evolving
PRDM9. We will infer a genetic map from linkage disequilibrium (LD) data as well as by End-
seq, a recently-developed approach to assay meiotic DSB frequencies in the genome. We will also
collect genomic data about salient histone marks, chromatin accessibility and expression levels.
These data will help us to establish if PRDM9 is used to direct recombination. The generality of
our findings will be evaluated by building and examining an LD-based map in a fish species with
an intact PRDM9, the Northern pike. Aim 2. What mechanisms direct the location of DSBs in
species lacking an intact PRDM9? Here, we will focus on two vertebrates: zebra finches, which
(like other birds) lack PRDM9 entirely, and swordtail fish, which lack the two N-terminal
domains. We will combine existing LD-based genetic maps with data that we will collect on DSB
frequencies, salient histone marks, chromatin accessibility, and expression levels. We will then
ask which genomic features influence local recombination rates and if they also play a role in
species with an intact PRDM9. Aim 3. What genes co-evolve with PRDM9? We will test 246
candidate genes for their co-evolution with PRDM9 across the vertebrate phylogeny. As a
byproduct, we will make available a pipeline to identify orthologs of interest. Aim 4. What drives
the evolution of PRDM9 binding? To answer this question, we developed a generative model,
from PRDM9 binding to population dynamics. We will extend our model, notably to characterize
conditions for the loss of PRDM9, and test key predictions with genomic and comparative data.
Thus, we will combine population genetic, phylogenetic and experimental approaches in four vertebrate
species to learn how DSBs are localized in the genome and how and why the mechanism differs among taxa.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
Everyday experience requires humans to make plans in a hierarchical fashion, so they can anticipate visual
events that might occur seconds, minutes, hours, or longer in the future. For example, when walking through a
city, individuals must track their immediate surroundings (e.g., the movement of pedestrians around them),
intermediate sub-goals (e.g., landmarks along their route), and long-timescale goals (e.g., their final destination).
Despite the ubiquity of such hierarchical anticipation in behavior, it is unclear how the brain can simultaneously
anticipate events at multiple timescales. Our aim is to uncover the mechanisms underlying hierarchical
anticipatory signals in the brain’s visual system, by determining how these signals form, what they represent,
how they are updated, and how they guide future-oriented behavior. This will be accomplished with functional
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), neuropsychological studies, naturalistic stimuli, computational models, and
sophisticated analytic approaches for characterizing the dynamics of brain activity. These methods will determine
the conditions under which the visual system generates hierarchical anticipatory signals, the content and
flexibility of those signals, how they arise, and their consequences for behavior. Aim 1 will establish how
hierarchical anticipatory signals form and what they represent. We hypothesize that such hierarchical anticipation
depends on input from memory systems, is informed by pre-existing schema, and is flexible in the visual features
and timescales represented. Aim 2 will determine how hierarchical anticipatory signals may be affected by top-
down goals to simulate the future, and how these signals relate to future-oriented visual behavior at a range of
timescales. We hypothesize that the visual hierarchy differentially updates its anticipatory signals when the
environment or goals change, and generates predictive signals in novel situations by linking separate episodic
memories. Finally, Aim 3 will test competing theories of the structure of anticipatory representations. We
hypothesize that anticipatory representations are influenced by both temporal and semantic relationships within
an event sequence, and propose a computational model for predicting anticipatory event representations learned
from a temporally-structured stimulus. Together, the findings will elucidate the mechanisms by which the visual
system forms and flexibly updates anticipatory representations at multiple timescales, and how these
representations relate to anticipatory behavior in naturalistic conditions. Such insights are important because
expectations are instrumental in allowing individuals to behave adaptively, and disruption of visual anticipation
might broadly impair goal-directed behavior. This work will therefore shed light on how the capacity to anticipate
upcoming events to adaptively guide behavior might be impaired following damage to different parts of the visual
system, including higher-order areas whose damage is not associated with primary visual deficits. Together, the
results will provide empirical tests of the structure and development of anticipatory signals across the visual
hierarchy, informing theories that consider the brain to be a fundamentally predictive organ.

Fast gradient-echo MRI is the preferred method to visualize iron deposition in human brain tissue with
susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI), to map functional activity with echo-planar imaging (EPI) and to assess
cranial nerve disorders with steady-state free precession (SSFP) MRI. However, its high susceptibility towards
B0 magnetic field inhomogeneity poses serious challenges. Particularly strong and localized B0 deviations are
observed above the sinus cavities in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), a brain area involved in many higher order
cognitive functions, and the orbits comprising, among others, eyes and cranial nerves. Spatial image
deformation and signal dropout induced by inhomogeneous B0 conditions can severely limit gradient-echo MRI
quality and even render results useless, thereby fundamentally limiting its diagnostic potential. We have
recently made major advances in the ability to obtain high levels of B0 homogeneity throughout the brain,
including difficult-to-shim areas such as the PFC using a novel multi-coil hardware in combination with rapid B0
optimization methods and dynamic shimming. B0 shimming with this Dynamic Multi-Coil Technique
(DYNAMITE) provides dramatically better B0 homogeneity than standard methods and in the future should
close to completely eliminate B0 inhomogeneity as a problem. Our objective in this proposal is to combine
DYNAMITE B0 shim with clinical RF technology to establish the first integrated multi-coil B0 and radio-
frequency (MC/RF) setup dedicated to clinical diagnostics and workflow. Specific Aim 1: Electromagnetic field
(EMF) simulations will be used to compare and optimize the potential of generating DYNAMITE B0 shim fields
with a dedicated multi-coil B0 setup separate from the employed RF coil, by driving elements of an RF phased
array with DC currents or a combination thereof in a hybrid approach, considering electromagnetic coupling
and safety. Specific Aim 2: Computer-aided design (CAD) methods comprising electromagnetic, thermal and
mechanical modeling will be used to realize the optimized MC/RF constellation for a clinical 3T MR scanner
environment, providing diagnostic MRI capability in an efficient, reliable and safe fashion. Moreover,
DYNAMITE B0 shimming tailored to routine clinical MRI protocols is expected to improve the overall image
quality throughout the human brain compared to conventional spherical harmonic-based B0 shim technology.
Specific Aim 3: DYNAMITE B0 shimming will be applied to diagnostic imaging of optic nerve diseases as part
of routine protocols and workflow in a fully automated fashion transparent to the medical staff to test the
hypothesis of enhanced diagnostic potential and a true clinical benefit due to MRI artifact mitigation. The
approach is innovative because the best available B0 shimming and RF technologies are combined to provide
unprecedented clinical MRI capabilities. The research is significant because it is expected to fundamentally
leverage the diagnostic potential of gradient-echo MRI in the ventral PFC and orbits, setting the stage for
widespread clinical use of state-of-the-art B0 shim technology and true translation from bench to bedside.

allows for the genetic programming of living cells to intelligently sense and respond to environments, ultimately
adding specificity and efficacy that is otherwise unattainable with molecular-based therapeutics. Due to recent
microbiome studies indicating the prevalence of bacteria within the human body and specifically in tumor tissue,
bacteria have generated significant interest as cancer therapies. Additionally, a multitude of empirical studies
have demonstrated that administered bacteria home and selectively grow in tumors due to reduced immune
surveillance of tumor cores. Given their presence and selectivity for tumors, bacteria present a unique oppor-
tunity to be engineered as intelligent delivery vehicles for cancer therapy.
The objective of this proposal is to engineer and optimize S. typhimurium for metastatic colorectal cancer
therapy. Since animal based-testing regimes limit the rate of clinical progress, we will use a high-throughput,
bacteria-spheroid platform to rapidly test therapeutic payloads and production and release strategies. We will
also assess the effect of therapies on colorectal genetic backgrounds, and investigate spatio-temporal hetero-
geneity in 3D spheroids with the use of engineered cell reporters. We will then test lead candidates in mouse
models of primary and metastatic colorectal cancer to evaluate safety and efficacy. We will focus on colorectal
cancer due to several proof-of-concept studies from our lab demonstrating efficacy in colorectal spheroids and
animal models. In particular, we showed that oral delivery of bacteria can specifically colonize colorectal liver
metastases, providing an attractive delivery route as a cancer therapy. Since these metastases are often con-
fined to the liver, this approach can have a significant impact on tumor growth and survival. The research in this
proposal will help to establish a framework to genetically engineer microbes for cancer therapy, and significantly
accelerates tools that will impact the broader cancer and synthetic biology communities. If successful, future
lead candidates for potential clinical trials will be identified on the basis of therapeutic efficacy and safety studies
from this proposal.

This is a continuation of an existing program funded by an RO1 that seeks to understand fundamental
questions about the nature of the olfactory stimulus and its discrimination by primary sensory receptors, in
order to better grasp the nature of the signal being forwarded to the brain. We supplement the standard
organic chemistry approach to odor classification with one that includes a biological perspective based in
principles of medicinal chemistry pioneered in the pharmaceutical industry and drug development. This allows
us to not only consider physical chemical characteristics of molecules but also how they interact with the many
olfactory receptors. This work, like much of olfactory cellular studies, utilized monomolecular stimuli to probe
receptor function. However the olfactory system is usually confronted with complex stimulus blends of
between tens and hundreds of components. To better understand the complexity of mixture discrimination we
have begun utilizing a novel microscopic technique, SCAPE – that allows us to visualize large numbers of
individual neurons in an intact tissue with single cell temporal and spatial resolution. Preliminary data from that
work showed a remarkable and unexpected degree of inhibition and enhancement of responses by one
component of the mixture on other components of the mixture. This raises a fundamental issue in olfactory
discrimination as there appears to be considerable interaction between stimuli at the primary receptor, raising
crucial questions about how the brain perceives and manages signals that differ depending on the presence of
particular odors in a blend. It appears that many, if not all, odors can act as either an agonist or antagonist at
different receptors. Thus depending on whether or not an antagonist to odor X, for example, exists in the
blend, the signal from odor X will appear different to the brain. This level of complexity is unusual in sensory
systems where signal processing of this sort occurs in the brain not the primary receptors. Understanding
higher brain processing olfactory signals will require a greater understanding of the initial events at primary
receptors. The olfactory code is more than the additive contributions of the olfactory receptors.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
The efficiency with which messenger RNAs (mRNAs) are translated into proteins by the ribosome is a
fundamental determinant of gene expression. This efficiency is often determined during the mRNA recruitment
step of translation by the ribosome. Consequently, this step is a crucial point of control for gene expression. In
eukaryotes, mRNA recruitment is an elaborate, multi-step, and highly regulated process that depends upon the
activities of ~13 eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs). Dysregulation of eIF activity and mRNA recruitment has been
causally linked to tumorigenesis, tumor growth, drug resistance, and metastasis in an increasing list of human
cancers. Consequently, several eIFs and their roles in mRNA recruitment are emerging as very attractive
anticancer drug targets, with an existing, FDA-approved, eIF-targeting compound already having been
successfully repurposed as an anticancer therapy. In order to expand and fully exploit this therapeutic potential,
however, it is necessary to understand the molecular events that underlie eIF function and mRNA recruitment.
 Here, we will use a highly purified, fluorophore-labeled, Saccharomyces cerevisiae in vitro translation
system that we developed and that includes a full-length, site-specifically labeled eIF4G and a fully reconstituted,
site-specifically labeled eIF3, reagents that have been difficult to generate. With these reagents in hand, we will
use state-of-the-art, single-molecule fluorescence microscopy and cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM),
including a pioneering, time-resolved cryo-EM approach developed by our collaborator, Dr. Joachim Frank, to
directly observe and characterize the dynamics of mRNA recruitment during eukaryotic translation initiation.
 In Aim 1, we will investigate the mechanism through which the multi-component eIF4F complex activates
different classes of mRNAs for loading onto ribosomal 43S pre-initiation complexes (PICs), and how changes to
the composition of the eIF4F complex can alter which classes of mRNAs are activated. We hypothesize that the
structural dynamics of the activated mRNA complex are critical for mRNA loading and will quantify how these
dynamics contribute to mRNA selection. In Aim 2, we will investigate how the multi-component eIF3 complex
interacts with different classes of mRNAs and/or the 43S PIC in order to facilitate mRNA activation and/or loading
onto a 43S PIC, as well as how biologically active subcomplexes of eIF3 can modulate these activities. A large-
scale structural rearrangement of 43S PIC-bound eIF3 is thought to control its mRNA loading activity and we will
therefore characterize how this rearrangement facilitates formation of the 48S PIC on mRNAs of different
classes. In Aim 3, we will investigate the mechanism through which eIF1A and eIF5B mediate mRNA start-codon
recognition within a 48S PIC. Start-codon recognition by eIF1A has recently been associated with a large-scale
rearrangement of the 48S PIC in which eIF5B and initiator transfer RNA (Met-tRNAi) are repositioned in
preparation for joining of the large subunit to the 48S PIC to form the elongation-competent 80S IC. We will
characterize these 48S PIC dynamics and determine their role in start-codon recognition and subunit joining.

The effects of long-term locus coeruleus stimulation on amyloid/tau pathology, synaptic plasticity, and
memory during Alzheimer’s disease progression
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease and accounts for up to 80% of all dementia
diagnoses. Despite the immense burden that AD imposes on society, there is currently no effective method to
prevent or treat AD. Severe degeneration of the locus coeruleus (LC) is a ubiquitous hallmark in AD. The LC is
the primary source of norepinephrine (NE) to the whole forebrain and regulates many aspects of normal brain
function. An aberrant form of tau is found in the LC in young healthy adults, making the LC the first region with
AD-like neuropathology in the human brain. Previous work has suggested that NE facilitates the immune-
mediated removal of Aβ through regulation of microglial phagocytosis. In addition, the anti-inflammatory effect
of NE has been demonstrated in many studies. Therefore, the LC-NE system is a promising therapeutic target
in AD. However, the consequences of long-term LC stimulation during AD progression remain unknown. In this
project, using a synthesis of chemogenetic manipulation, retrograde Cre-dependent viral ablation,
immunohistology, and behavioral paradigms, we will examine the effects of long-term locus coeruleus
stimulation on amyloid/tau pathology, synaptic plasticity, and memory in Aβ and tau mouse models. In Aim 1,
we will determine the extent to which long term direct LC stimulation delays the deterioration of memory
function and improves synaptic plasticity. In Aim 2, we will characterize the effects of long-term LC stimulation
on amyloid and tau pathology during AD progression. In Aim 3, we will examine the role of non-uniform LC
degeneration in structure-specific amyloid and tau pathology in the brain. This project will provide much-
needed insight about the extent to which long term LC stimulation mitigates amyloid and tau pathology and
rescues memory functions during AD progress. Such information will likely lead to the development of new
therapeutics for AD that utilize both non-invasive and invasive brain stimulation technologies to directly engage
the LC-NE system.

Gene expression is tightly controlled at both the RNA and protein level by mechanisms involving chromatin
modification, transcriptional regulation, mRNA splicing, processing, translation and degradation. Each of these
processes are regulated by nucleic acid-protein interactions (DNA-protein and RNA-protein). Accordingly, there
have been tremendous efforts in the scientific community to comprehensively map these interactions, including
major international research efforts (e.g. ENCODE, RoadMap Epigenomics) focused on generating reference
maps for specific cell types. However, because these binding maps are highly specific for individual cell types,
there is a critical need to enable the generation of comprehensive genomic maps for any cell type of interest –
including primary cell types, disease models, or other rare cell populations – within an individual lab. This goal
remains challenging because existing assays can only map interactions of a single protein at a time and are
therefore prohibitively expensive.
To address these issues, this proposal will develop a highly innovative technology based on our split-pool
barcoding strategy (SPRITE) that maps multiway protein-nucleic acid interactions using high throughput
sequencing. The proposed Hi-P technology will be used to establish: (i) a highly multiplexed eCLIP-seq method
to map up to hundreds of RNA binding proteins simultaneously to their RNA binding sites, (ii) a highly multiplexed
ChIP-seq method to map up to hundreds of DNA binding proteins and histone modifications to their DNA binding
sites, and (iii) methods to map these multiple protein-nucleic acid interactions across many samples, among
these rare cell types, simultaneously.
The proposed technology represents a major advance – it will dramatically increase the scale of existing methods
and create new capabilities that are currently not possible. These tools will empower individual researchers to
generate detailed genomic datasets in specific biological and disease contexts that are comparable in size and
complexity to those generated by the ENCODE project at a tiny fraction of its cost. More generally, we anticipate
that these tools will lead to critical new insights into gene regulation and human disease.

To what extent is adaptive evolution predictable? Despite its importance in understanding the biology of human diseases,
including the evolution of viral and bacterial pathogens, the dynamics of genetic adaptation are still poorly understood. In
particular, few examples yet exist that have been dissected to the molecular level. Examples of adaptations from natural
systems and the use of model organisms are powerful tools that can be combined to make progress on this difficult
question. We have employed instances of “parallel evolution”, involving assemblages of species experiencing a common
regime of natural selection, to evaluate multiple outcomes of the process of adaptation. With this information, we can
learn about recurrent features of adaptation and infer constraints and regularities in the adaptive process. Our work
focused on the biomedically-important interaction between Na+,K+-ATPases and their regulatory steroidal-glycosides that
a large variety of plants and animals use as toxins to defend themselves from being eaten. Using a diverse set of animals
that have independently evolved resistance to steroidal-glycoside toxicity, including insects and vertebrates, we
discovered these diverse species most often evolve resistance via a small number of possible options (i.e. involving only
three of 41 possible sites in the protein that could be modified to confer resistance). These findings suggest that adaptive
evolution is often path-dependent, implying that the individual components of an adaptation must evolve in a prescribed,
and ultimately predictable, order. They also raise numerous questions about the nature of this path dependency, including
the extent to which it emerges from interactions among residues within a protein, or from the genomic background of the
species; whether it similarly constrains adaptation over short and longer time scales, and how generally it applies in
adaptive protein evolution. Here we propose three aims that address these questions, by combining approaches from
evolutionary genomics and molecular genetics. In Aim 1, we will use genome engineering in Drosophila to elucidate the
path dependence of the steroidal-glycoside resistance adaptation both at the level of its primary target (Na+,K+-ATPase)
and at the level of the whole genome. In Aim 2, we will determine which and how many genomic factors contribute to
naturally occurring variation within Drosophila populations. This information will reveal the relationship between within-
population and between-species genetic variation underlying the same trait, connecting short- and long-term dynamics of
the adaptive process. In Aim 3, we will use principles learned from molecular adaptation at Na+,K+-ATPase to
computationally predict and use genome engineering to functionally validate path dependent adaptation dynamics in
Drosophila for a diverse group of proteins, many of which (like Na+,K+-ATPase) have important roles in neurological
development and homeostasis. Together this work will greatly increase our understanding of the constraints on adaptive
protein evolution and the predictability of the genetic changes by which novel phenotypes emerge.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
Everyday experience requires humans to make plans in a hierarchical fashion, so they can anticipate visual
events that might occur seconds, minutes, hours, or longer in the future. For example, when walking through a
city, individuals must track their immediate surroundings (e.g., the movement of pedestrians around them),
intermediate sub-goals (e.g., landmarks along their route), and long-timescale goals (e.g., their final destination).
Despite the ubiquity of such hierarchical anticipation in behavior, it is unclear how the brain can simultaneously
anticipate events at multiple timescales. Our aim is to uncover the mechanisms underlying hierarchical
anticipatory signals in the brain’s visual system, by determining how these signals form, what they represent,
how they are updated, and how they guide future-oriented behavior. This will be accomplished with functional
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), neuropsychological studies, naturalistic stimuli, computational models, and
sophisticated analytic approaches for characterizing the dynamics of brain activity. These methods will determine
the conditions under which the visual system generates hierarchical anticipatory signals, the content and
flexibility of those signals, how they arise, and their consequences for behavior. Aim 1 will establish how
hierarchical anticipatory signals form and what they represent. We hypothesize that such hierarchical anticipation
depends on input from memory systems, is informed by pre-existing schema, and is flexible in the visual features
and timescales represented. Aim 2 will determine how hierarchical anticipatory signals may be affected by top-
down goals to simulate the future, and how these signals relate to future-oriented visual behavior at a range of
timescales. We hypothesize that the visual hierarchy differentially updates its anticipatory signals when the
environment or goals change, and generates predictive signals in novel situations by linking separate episodic
memories. Finally, Aim 3 will test competing theories of the structure of anticipatory representations. We
hypothesize that anticipatory representations are influenced by both temporal and semantic relationships within
an event sequence, and propose a computational model for predicting anticipatory event representations learned
from a temporally-structured stimulus. Together, the findings will elucidate the mechanisms by which the visual
system forms and flexibly updates anticipatory representations at multiple timescales, and how these
representations relate to anticipatory behavior in naturalistic conditions. Such insights are important because
expectations are instrumental in allowing individuals to behave adaptively, and disruption of visual anticipation
might broadly impair goal-directed behavior. This work will therefore shed light on how the capacity to anticipate
upcoming events to adaptively guide behavior might be impaired following damage to different parts of the visual
system, including higher-order areas whose damage is not associated with primary visual deficits. Together, the
results will provide empirical tests of the structure and development of anticipatory signals across the visual
hierarchy, informing theories that consider the brain to be a fundamentally predictive organ.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
The nervous system of most bilaterian animals consists of two classes of cells, neurons and glia, each of which
comprised of many different types. While great strides have been made in understanding the gene regulatory
mechanisms that specify the fate and identity of distinct neuronal cell types, comparatively little is known about
how glia cell types differentiate into distinct types and subtypes and how their differentiated state is maintained
throughout the life of the animal.
The restricted size and complexity of the nervous system of C. elegans has enabled the discovery of broad,
overarching organizational themes of neuronal cell fate specification. Specifically, we have recently described
that all neuronal cell types of the worm are uniquely defined by neuron type-specific combinations of
homeodomain protein expression and, consequently, that the vast majority, if not all, neuronal cell types require
homeodomain proteins for their proper identity fate specification. Moreover, most homeodomain proteins work
as master-regulatory terminal selectors to coregulate the many distinct identity features of a given neuron types.
In this grant proposal, we set out to test the hypothesis that similar gene regulatory principles operate to specify
the identity and diversity of the complete set of 17 distinct glial cell types in C. elegans. Leveraging the unique
opportunities offered by the C. elegans model system, we ask whether each of the 17 distinct glial cell types of
the C. elegans hermaphrodite is uniquely defined by a glial-type specific signatures of homeodomain proteins.
Using rigorous loss of function analysis, in combination with gain of function analysis, we will ask whether
homeodomain proteins operate in a master regulatory-type manner to specify the fate of all the distinct glial cell
type of C. elegans. Lastly, we will integrate the function of homeodomain proteins with potential pan-glia
regulators of glial fate specification.
This approach presents the first nervous system-wide view of glia cell fate specification, potentially carving out
general regulatory principles about glial identity specification and maintenance. Our analysis may provide
insights into potential evolutionary trajectories of glial cell type specification and may reveal candidates for
future functional analysis in the vertebrate system.

Precisely mapping the structure of synaptic connectivity offers a pathway to understanding the function of
neural circuits and how they go awry in neurological disease. Holographic optogenetics has recently emerged
as a revolutionary technology capable of optically probing the synaptic structure and function of neural circuits
through the stimulation of neurons with near single-cell precision. However, despite its success, this technology
is currently greatly underutilized due to a lack of computational methods capable of modeling these complex
experiments and interpreting the data they generate. Thus, there is a need for new computational methods to
maximize the scientific impact of holographic optogenetics in neuroscience research.
In recent work, I have created a machine learning algorithm for inferring monosynaptic connectivity from
holographic stimulation of specifically targeted populations of neurons. This algorithm increased the rate of in
vitro monosynaptic connectivity mapping by more than an order of magnitude over existing approaches using
optogenetic stimulation, demonstrating the transformative effect that computational methods can have in this
scientific domain. Building on this advance, I now propose to develop a set of computational methods enabling
holographic control and mapping of neural circuits in vivo and at unprecedented detail, scale, and precision.
In Aim 1 of this proposal, I will develop a real-time target optimization algorithm to select holographic
stimulation parameters that eliminate the unintended activation of non-target neurons when attempting to
probe the connectivity or function of neural circuits (K99). In Aim 2, I will extend my earlier connectivity
mapping inference approach by using calcium imaging to discriminate the presynaptic origin of postsynaptic
responses at extremely fine detail (K99/R00). Finally, in Aim 3, I will develop a computational approach that
leverages voltage imaging to all-optically map tens of thousands of potential recurrent connections between
hundreds of neurons (R00). Together, these aims provide practical tools enabling high-throughput collection of
large-scale maps of synaptic connectivity within individual experiments. Using these tools to probe the
structure and function of neural circuits could ultimately shed light on the etiology of neurological diseases.
During the K99 phase, this work will be conducted at the Zuckerman Mind Brain Behavior Institute at Columbia
University, where I will receive scientific training in computational neuroscience under Dr. Liam Paninski, a
leading authority in computational methods for neural data. Additionally, I will receive training in experimental
neuroscience from Drs. Hillel Adesnik and Adam Cohen, who are experts in holographic optogenetics and
voltage imaging. Their combined scientific expertise and impressive track record of transitioning postdoctoral
scientists to faculty positions make them the ideal mentorship team for my goal of becoming an independent
group leader working on computational methods for the optical interrogation of neural circuits.

The molecular processes of RNA transport and local translation are crucial in many aspects of
neuronal biology, including axonal growth and synaptic plasticity. Although some RNAs – such
as ACTB and ARC – have been well-studied and are known to be regulated in response to neural
activation, the underlying mechanisms governing them in space and in time are poorly understood.
RNA binding proteins (RBPs) are key regulators of RNAs, involved in all aspects of RNA biology
from processing and nuclear export, to transport, translation, and degradation. Current estimations
are that over 2,000 genes in the mammalian genome encode for RBPs, however, the molecular
function of most of these predicted RBPs remains unknown. Understanding RBP function is
challenging due to the complexity of RBP-RNA interactions. A single RBP can interact with
thousands of target transcripts, and each transcript can be targeted by many RBPs. In addition,
RBP-RNA interactions are dynamic – the association and dissociation of an RBP from its target
can drive functional changes. This complex and dynamic nature suggest that RBPs do not function
in isolation and are rather forming higher-order complexes to exert their functions. Here, I
hypothesize that RBPs form functional ‘modules’, by interacting with each other directly or by
binding on the same RNA molecule and propose a novel approach to study RBPs using a network
perspective. I aim to characterize the network of RBP interactions and how it rewires following
neuronal activity, in attempt to define functional modules and to identify the most promising
candidate regulators. To do so, I propose to use a combination of approaches. One is an RNA-
centric approach, focusing on two well-studied RNAs, discovering the complement of RBPs that
bind them and comparing between them, followed by detailed follow-up experiments investigating
whether and how those RBPs affect the target RNA (Aim 1 – K99). The other, a protein-centric
global approach, studying RBP interactions in an unbiased manner and describing how they
change in response to stimulation, in order to define regulatory modules and to identify candidate
regulators for mechanistic follow up (Aim 2 – K99). The combined results of these studies will
shed light on the architecture of RBP interactions and will define modules, which will advance our
understanding of these crucial molecules and will set the stage to investigate their functions in
depth in my independent lab (aim 3 - R00).

The “Netrin system” has well-studied roles in axon pathfinding and less studied roles in synapse
formation in animals from worms to humans. I propose to study the relative contribution of UNC-
6/Netrin derived from multiple neuronal and non-neuronal sources by characterizing the expression
and phenotypic effects of cis-regulatory alleles of unc-6 in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. We
hypothesize that deleting different sections of the cis-regulatory region of unc-6 will result in alleles
that lose expression in subsets of neurons and non-neuronal cells, depending on the locations of
transcription factor (TF) binding sites that regulate expression in these cells. This work will enable me
to identify circuit organizer TFs and their binding sites that regulate unc-6 expression in different cell
types and neuronal circuits, and may enable me to distinguish between unc-6-expressing cells required
for axon guidance and synapse formation. To achieve these goals, I will pursue two specific aims.1)
Generate cis-regulatory alleles of unc-6. 3) Assess the functional consequence of neuron-type specific
expression of unc-6. I have identified the neurons expressing unc-6 in WT worms expressing an unc-
6::sl2::gfp::h2b reporter allele generated by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome engineering, using the
NeuroPAL system to identify individual neurons. I will generate cis-regulatory alleles of unc-6 by using
CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome engineering to delete portions of the unc-6 cis-regulatory region, and
assess the which neurons lose expression in each cis-regulatory mutant. To assess the functional
consequences of neuron-type specific expression of unc-6, I will use reagents that enable the
visualization of neurites and synapses of neurons to assess the circuit-specific effects of unc-6 cis-
regulatory alleles on axon pathfinding and synapse formation. Through this work, I will elucidate the
regulation of unc-6, as well as its function in axon guidance and synapse formation in various neuronal
circuits. Through the pursuit of this project, I will develop skills in rigorous hypothesis-driven research,
literature review, written and oral communication of research results, and mentorship that I will need

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
 Chemical modification of proteins is an important strategy for understanding their structure/function and
has guided the design of new pharmaceutical products and targeted therapeutics. Accordingly, new technologies
that target amino acid side chains in both selective and unselective fashions are necessary to gain advanced
biochemical information. In bioconjugation processes, amino acids are selectively targeted and modified.
However, classical bioconjugation strategies rely upon the inherent nucleophilicity of amino acid side chains,
rendering the selective modification of less nucleophilic sites a significant challenge. At the same time, the ability
to rapidly modify a variety of amino acids is necessary for proximity labeling, a strategy where proteins are tagged
with reactive probes for mapping the cellular microenvironment to better understand spatial connections and
relationships between biomolecules. Visible light photoredox catalysis has emerged as a powerful platform for
modifying amino acids through redox events. The use of visible light as a sustainable and non-invasive stimulus
not only facilitates the mild generation of reactive intermediates, but also enables spatiotemporal control over
chemical reactivity, a desirable feature particularly in the treatment of disease. Nevertheless, the extension of
photoredox catalysis into biological applications is underexplored because photocatalyst activation requires high-
energy blue light, which penetrates tissue poorly and can result in background activation of molecules.
 This proposal describes the development and biological applications of red light bioconjugation and
proximity labeling platforms using Os(II) photocatalysts that proceed via the conversion of small molecules into
reactive probes that can react with amino acids selectively or promiscuously. A method for selective
bioconjugation of aspartic acid (Asp) and glutamic acid (Glu) is described wherein red light-photoexcited Os
photocatalysts activate vinyl azides into strained 2H-azirines, molecules that have been demonstrated to
undergo selective reactions with carboxylates instead of other more nucleophilic groups. A unique mechanism
is proposed upon reaction of a carboxylate group with photocatalytically-generated 2H-azirines to produce
oxazole-derived products in the covalent modification. A variety of Os catalysts with high triplet energy values
will be synthesized and evaluated in this method, which can then be translated to chemoselective labeling of
these residues on peptides and proteins. The ability of this class of photocatalysts to generate carbenes from
(trifluoromethyl)aryl diazos will also be explored. Reactivity will be established in the context of O–H insertion,
reactions with amino acids, and in isolated proteins. Due to their reactive nature, the carbenes react with a variety
of side chains rapidly, a feature that will be leveraged in tightening labeling radii in proximity labeling on cell
surfaces. Proximity labeling mediated by low energy red light presents two significant advances: (1) the use of
tissue-penetrating and noncytotoxic red light, and (2) minimization of any background substrate activation,
enabling high precision in spatiotemporal labeling.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
Investigating genetic differences that lead to significant variation in pain sensitivity and behavioral
responsiveness have contributed to the thorough mapping of the peripheral pain pathway. In contrast, the pain
pathway in the brain and the neural mechanisms underlying affective pain are relatively underexplored. By
looking beyond the commonly used C57BL/6J (6J) mouse line, I have identified a C57 subline, C57BL/10SnJ
(10SnJ), that shows a novel affective pain phenotype of increased pain-linked escape behavior in comparison
to 6J mice. Preliminary work has found that 10SnJ mice show increased neural activity in the ventral lateral
periaqueductal grey (vlPAG) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) during pain-linked escape behavior. A wealth
of prior research has shown that the PAG is responsible for escape behavior initiation, and studies have identified
a glutamatergic circuit from the ACC to vlPAG that modulates pain. My hypothesis is that 10SnJ mice have
heightened ACC to vlPAG circuit activity that drives their massive pain-linked escape behavioral response. This
proposal will utilize the 10SnJ outlier strain and existing genetic tools in 6J mice to elucidate the role of the vlPAG
in pain-linked escape behavior. Studying this novel behavioral phenotype will increase our knowledge of the
circuits and cell types that govern affective pain and heightened pain states. In Aim 1, I will elucidate the vlPAG
cell type responsible for increased pain-linked escape behavior using first RNA in situ of known vlPAG specific
cell types to identify a target. The sufficiency, necessity, and specificity of this cell type for pain-linked escape
behavior will then be determined using excitatory and inhibitory Cre-dependent opsins and an associated 6J Cre
line. Next in Aim 2 I will determine the contribution of the ACCGlu → vlPAG circuit to increased pain-linked escape
behavior. I will first trace the circuit with anterograde and retrograde viral tracers in 10SnJ and 6J mice and
compare the circuit activity during pain-linked escape behavior using cFos immunohistochemistry. A 6J VGlut
Cre mouse line will then be used to determine the correlation of the ACCGlu → vlPAG circuit with pain-linked
escape behavior using in vivo fiber photometry targeting the vlPAG measuring a Cre-dependent calcium indicator
delivered via an anterograde tracer injected into the ACC. Finally I will determine the sufficiency and necessity
of the ACCGlu → vlPAG circuit for pain-linked escape behavior by stimulating in the ACC either an excitatory or
inhibitory cre dependent opsin delivered via a retrograde tracer injected into the vlPAG. The proposed study
would identify a vlPAG cell type and circuit responsible for the novel behavioral type escape behavior in
specifically painful situations. This proposal would add significantly to the field's understanding of how the vlPAG
contributes to the affective aspect of pain, and prepare me for a career as an independent researcher.

 Calcium (Ca2+) is a critical regulator of neurotransmission in both axons and dendrites of neurons. Ca2+
fluctuations during neuronal activation are usually attributed to influx through voltage gated Ca2+ channels, but
in vitro evidence suggests that intracellular Ca2+ handling, particularly by the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), could
shape cytosolic Ca2+ signals and therefore neurotransmission. Our preliminary data indicate that the ER in
neurons of the Drosophila visual system displays Ca2+ fluctuations in response to visual stimulus in vivo. Given
that altered ER Ca2+ signaling has been implicated in neurodegeneration and retinal degeneration, the objective
of this work is to determine the role of ER Ca2+ signaling in Drosophila visual system neurons and determine the
molecular basis of compartment specific ER Ca2+ signals in motion vision circuits. The first aim is to determine
the underlying mechanisms governing compartment specific ER Ca2+ signals using in vivo 2-photon microscopy.
Findings from this aim will help elucidate the functional roles of ER Ca2+ signals in axons and dendrites. The
second aim is to determine the role of ER Ca2+ handling neurotransmission and in motion vision circuit function,
leveraging genetic perturbations in well-defined circuits. These studies will determine if ER Ca2+ signaling shapes
cytosolic Ca2+ fluctuations, linking it to circuit function and neurotransmission in the visual system. The fellowship
training plan includes in vivo 2-photon imaging, Drosophila genetics, programming, and career guidance.
Through training opportunities during this project, I will develop the skills to complete this work, and continue in
a career in academic research.

 Notch signaling is a fundamental regulator of lymphatic growth, function and vessel homeostasis. Lymphatic
dysfunction is associated with many acquired human diseases, including liver fibrosis, psoriasis, metabolic
diseases, and cancer. The postnatal lymphatic endothelium dynamically expresses both Notch1 and Notch4, as
well as the Notch ligands, Jag1 and Dll4. Numerous therapies that target Notch pathway components are in
clinical development or trials. Thus, it is essential to understand the role of the distinct receptors and ligands of
the Notch pathway in the adult lymphatic vasculature.
 Downstream of Dll4- and Jag1-activation, we found that Notch1 and Notch4 have overlapping and distinct
transcriptional profiles in lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs), suggesting a dynamic role for Notch in LECs. Our
studies of Notch4-/- mice indicate that Notch4 regulates dermal lymphatic vascular patterning, while it is
necessary specifically in adult females for the regeneration and maintenance of dermal lymphatics. Using in vitro
studies, we show that Notch4 regulates proliferation, and VECADHERIN expression posttranslationally, which
in turn may affect LEC growth, responses to flow and barrier function. Postnatal deletion of LEC Notch4 using a
novel transgenic model led to reduced dermal capillary lymphatics and LEC proliferation and altered
VECADHERIN expression. Analysis of male N4LECKO mice revealed increased hepatic portal lymphatics
associated with multiple hallmarks of pathological liver disease and fibrosis.
 We hypothesize that Dll4 and Jag1 dynamically signal via Notch1 and Notch4 in capillary lymphatics
to maintain lymphatic vessel homeostasis and regeneration in the adult. To address these hypotheses, we
propose to 1) transcriptionally profile lymphatic endothelial Notch1 and Notch4 signaling downstream of Dll4 and
Jag1 activation using in vitro and in vivo approaches, 2) determine the mechanisms by which Notch4 functions
in the dermal lymphatic endothelium of the adult mice, and 3) determine the role of lymphatic endothelial Notch4
in the liver and a mouse model of dietary-induced non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). The goal is to
understand LEC Notch4 functions in lymphatic vascular maintenance and homeostasis and how its loss
contributes to pathogenic phenotypes in the skin and liver.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：SUMMARY
This project aims to establish a novel mechanism of human stem cell pluripotency control through nucleolar
structure integrity for functional ribosome biogenesis (RiBi) and proper genome organization/gene expression,
regulated by the nucleolar DEAD-box (DDX) RNA helicase DDX18. This paradigm contrasts with the extensively
studied direct transcription and translation control by well-established transcription factors and translation
regulators in the nucleoplasm and cytoplasm. The nucleolus has mystified the research community for centuries
due to the elusive biophysical principles governing the well-known subcompartmental organization and limited
molecular tools interrogating their nuclear functions. Much work on the nucleolus has focused on its role in
regulating RNA polymerase I (RNA Pol I) transcription and ribosome biogenesis; however, emerging evidence
points to the nucleolus as an organizing hub for many nuclear functions, accomplished via the shuttling of
proteins and nucleic acids between the nucleolus and the nucleoplasm. As a result, we know very little about
how the nucleolus maintains its membraneless structural integrity necessary to control stem cell-specific RiBi
and translation rates, as well as genome organization and gene expression. With the new technology that is
becoming available in studying biomolecular condensates and the realization of the roles of DDX RNA helicases
in cellular RNP condensates and RNA metabolism, this project will address novel nucleolar functions in
controlling conventional hESC pluripotency. Notably, nucleolar functions beyond the RiBi, such as the regulation
of nuclear architectures and genome stability in shaping cellular identities, have just begun to be appreciated,
providing a window of opportunity to explore a paradigm of pluripotency control beyond the well-established
nuclear transcription and cytoplasmic translation machinery. DDX18 is unique among many RNA helicases as it
is strictly nucleolus-specific, and its depletion alters gene expression through the impairment of the nucleolus
integrity pericentromeric heterochromatin reorganization, providing new evidence supporting the functions of the
nucleolus as an inter-chromosomal hub for 3D chromatin organization within ESCs. We hypothesize that DDX18
interacts with specific nucleolar partner proteins and snoRNAs/rRNAs to maintain nucleolar integrity and genome
architecture for controlling the pluripotency of hESCs. We propose two aims to test this hypothesis. 1) Define
the molecular traits of DDX18 in modulating LLPS for nucleolar structure integrity in hESCs. 2) Establish the
nucleolar functions of DDX18 in the organization of chromatin and gene expression to maintain hESC
pluripotency. 3) Dissect the roles of nucleolar DDX18 protein partners and RNA targets in maintaining nucleolar
structure integrity and hESC pluripotency. Upon the completion of this project, we will establish a novel paradigm
in which a nucleolar RNA helicase, namely DDX18, coordinates phase separation and chromatin organization
through its unique biophysical properties and functional partnerships with nucleolar cofactors and RNAs in
controlling human pluripotency.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Children born in the context of poverty have 10 years lower life expectancy and an increased likelihood of having
compromised health and development, highlighting the urgent need for effective interventions to reduce health
disparities. Supportive perinatal interventions reduce health risk disparities rooted in early experience, but to
evaluate interventions’ effects on offspring development, researchers must either wait years for health outcomes
to emerge in offspring, or use high-cost, labor intensive assessments such as MRI. Causal evidence of perinatal
interventions’ effects on a biological level could provide mechanistic insight into interventions’ influence,
contributing non-invasive, proximal indicators to evaluate, compare, and refine interventions for specific
populations. However, existing studies on perinatal biological embedding are based primarily on observational
data and do not provide the requisite experimental leverage for causal inference. The proposed project
capitalizes on a randomized trial of an evidence-based perinatal intervention, the Nurse Family Partnership
(NFP) to a) experimentally test the hypothesis of perinatal biological embedding via the mechanism of DNA
methylation (DNAm) in offspring and b) identify non-invasive biological indicators that could be used to evaluate
perinatal interventions’ early effects on child development. Studies in rodents causally implicate DNAm in in the
biological embedding of perinatal adversity. Novel potential biomarkers of perinatal biological embedding in
humans include 1) a cross-tissue DNAm signature of glucocorticoid (GC) exposure, developed using
hippocampal progenitor cells, and validated using neonatal blood samples and 2) the Pediatric Buccal Epigenetic
clock (PedBE), derived from buccal cells, which provides a measure of epigenetic aging, which is associated
with compromised infant brain growth and neurodevelopment. Leveraging these two methodological advances
and a new funded trial of the NFP, we will implement minimally-invasive buccal cell biosampling from 446 infants
born to pregnant individuals (>50% Black), participating in the NFP trial (n=223 randomized to receive the NFP,
n=223 control) at baseline and 24 months. We will generate DNAm biomarkers across infancy and paired genetic
data using low pass whole genome sequencing. We propose that maternal NFP participation, versus care as
usual, will alter the biological embedding of perinatal adversity, as reflected by DNAm biomarkers of GC exposure
and pediatric epigenetic aging over infancy, which will correlate with infant development at 24 months. Aim 1:
Test whether the NFP causes variation in DNAm at GC-sensitive sites in infants over the first two years of life.
Aim 2: Determine whether NFP causes differences in epigenetic age in infants over the first two years of life.
Aim 3: Identify DNAm signatures as predictors of infant development at 24 months of age. The results would
provide causal evidence for perinatal biological embedding of supportive intervention via DNAm, and contribute
to direct, proximal indicators of perinatal interventions’ salutary effects against developmental risk in the context
of adversity. This would refine intervention evaluation and inform policy decisions to redress health inequities.

Maternal exposure to complex metal mixtures during pregnancy may impair child growth and development to
impact later health. In New York City (NYC), pregnant individuals from low-income and Hispanic communities
are at risk of toxic metals exposure and children from these communities are also more likely to be born small-
for-gestational age (SGA) or with low birthweight, dictating later child growth trajectories, educational attainment,
and socioeconomic advancement. The placenta is the master regulator of fetal development and a first line of
defense against toxic metal exposures. Direct and indirect interactions between toxic (e.g., arsenic [As],
cadmium [Cd], lead [Pb]) and essential (e.g., manganese [Mn], selenium [Se], zinc [Zn]) metals in placental
tissue may result in cellular and molecular damage that can impact placental function. Defining concrete
mechanism(s) for the effects of metals on the placenta will advance efforts to protect millions of children from a
widespread threat. Yet, our insight into placental mechanisms linking prenatal metal exposures to impaired
growth is limited. The discovery of post-transcriptional modifications of RNA, collectively named the
epitranscriptome, as key regulators of placental gene expression provide an innovative avenue to address this
gap. N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most prevalent epitranscriptomic modification on messenger RNA (mRNA)
and modulates mRNA splicing, stability, and translation. m6A and its reader, writer, and eraser proteins (RWEs)
that interpret, add, and remove m6A marks, are responsive to toxicant exposures and regulate the cellular
response to oxidative stress and inflammation, which are key processes governing metal toxicity to the placenta.
These changes in m6A can subsequently regulate downstream proteomic responses to toxicant exposure. We
hypothesize that essential (Mn, Se, Zn, etc.) and toxic (As, Cd, Pb, etc.) metals accumulated in the placenta
directly influence child health in utero by dysregulating the m6A epitranscriptome and downstream proteome. We
will test our hypotheses with a discovery-replication design in two NYC-based, low income, Hispanic birth
cohorts, Fair Start (FS) (N=400) and Sibling-Hermanos (Hermanos) (N=100). In Aim 1, we will use placental
tissue to investigate 19 metals and their associations with expression of 18 m6A RWEs, transcript-level m6A from
m6A-sequencing, and the inflammation and metabolism-related proteome. In Aim 2, we will identify placental
m6A epitranscriptome and proteome alterations associated with birth outcomes (SGA, birthweight, gestational
length, head circumference, ponderal index) and early child growth trajectories (height, weight, BMI) at ages 0.5,
1, 2, 3, 5, 7, and 9 years. In Aim 3, we will construct a placental “metallome” – a network of the m6A
epitranscriptome and proteome linking prenatal metals to birth outcomes and child growth trajectories. Together,
these aims will lead to novel insight into the mechanisms linking placental metals, the placental epitranscriptome,
and the ensuing effects on child growth and development. It will open new avenues for metals risk assessment
and the development of placenta-based therapeutics to avert the harmful impacts of metals on child health.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：ABSTRACT
Increasing evidence indicates that air pollution is a relevant risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) even
at low exposure levels. American Indian populations experience the highest burden of CVD compared to other
racial/ethnic groups in the US and thus may be particularly vulnerable to air pollution. Further, although air
pollution exposure levels have decreased in recent decades in the general US population, these decreases are
less pronounced in American Indian populations, suggesting environmental disparities in air pollution
mitigation. However, there is currently a lack of relevant data to comprehensively characterize air pollution
levels, components, and sources in American Indian and other rural populations, which are needed to inform
effective mitigation and intervention strategies. We propose to study the associations of air pollution exposure
with CVD as well as with subclinical risk factors for CVD (blood pressure) in American Indian communities in
the Southwest and Great Plains. We will leverage data from the NHLBI-funded Strong Heart Study (SHS)
cohort to study short-term and long-term cardiovascular effects of air pollution in American Indian communities.
Aim 1: We will characterize ambient air pollution via measurements and spatio-temporal modeling in the three
SHS study regions (Arizona, Oklahoma, North and South Dakota). For four years, we will use filters and
pumping boxes at a central site in each study region to obtain two-week average concentrations of ambient
fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and its components including black and organic carbon, metals, and acids. We
will also obtain two-week averages of ozone (O3) levels using passive samples. In a subset of 240 SHS
participants (80 per region) in three different seasons, we will measure ambient real-time PM2.5 levels for one
week. Our measurements and other available PM2.5, nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and O3 data will be used to build
spatio-temporal air pollution models for SHS regions. Source apportionment will be used to identify pollution
sources. Aim 2: We will determine short-term cardiovascular effects of air pollution exposure in these
communities. We will evaluate associations between ambient PM2.5 levels and composition, NO2, and O3 (from
Aim 1) with measures of ambulatory blood pressure monitoring in 240 SHS participants in three repeated
measurements over 18 months. Aim 3: We will determine long-term cardiovascular effects of ambient air
pollution exposure. We will evaluate associations between long-term exposure to PM2.5, NO2, and O3
(estimated with our model in Aim 1) and incident CVD (coronary heart disease, stroke, heart failure) in the SHS
cohort (N = 2,736) and its family expansion (N = 2,769) using high-quality data for 2000–2024. This study will
comprehensively characterize air pollution exposures and associations with clinical CVD outcomes in

Periodontitis is a common, chronic, inflammatory disease, triggered by subgingival microbial agents, which can
lead to tooth loss and contribute to systemic inflammation. Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) is an important systemic
modifier of periodontitis, associated with increased severity and progression of periodontal destruction in affected
individuals. Of note, there are large disparities in the prevalence of both periodontitis and T2DM, with minority
and low socio-economic status individuals, especially Blacks, being disproportionately affected.
Although pro-oxidative and pro-inflammatory signaling have been described as mechanisms underlying
enhanced periodontal destruction, especially in the presence of T2DM, the specific, upstream events involving
innate immunity and immune cell recruitment are still not fully understood. Recent studies at the single-cell level
from our group revealed that: 1) there is heterogeneity in resident immune cells in gingival tissue and in
circulating monocytes/macrophages in periodontitis and T2DM; 2) there is a systemic pre-programming of
circulating monocytes towards a pro-inflammatory state in patients with periodontitis and T2DM; 3) there are
race-specific cellular changes in gingival tissue in periodontitis, including a decrease in immune tolerant PD-L1+
monocyte/macrophages in Blacks, associated with reduced anti-inflammatory macrophage phenotype; and 4)
the epigenetic regulator JMJD3 can control macrophage polarization and function in periodontitis.
These preliminary findings strongly support the feasibility and significance of the three specific aims in the
present application. The proposed work is original and innovative as it seeks to shift current thinking in the field.
We plan to build upon our previous work and test our overarching hypothesis that periodontitis, on its own and
especially when complicated by T2DM, significantly affects the cellular composition, transcriptomic profile, and
monocyte/macrophage activation and function locally (gingival tissue) and systemically (circulation), and that
race plays an important role in this setting. First, we propose to dissect the single-cell transcriptomic signature
and functional network of myeloid-derived cells in periodontitis patients without or with T2DM. Using single-cell
RNA-sequencing, we will identify the transcriptional networks associated with immune cells in gingival tissue and
blood samples of periodontitis patients versus healthy controls, and the added burden conferred by T2DM. Then,
we propose to identify the effects of race on monocyte/macrophage signaling and function in periodontitis
patients without or with T2DM. We will explore the biological basis for the observed periodontal health disparities
in Blacks, namely differences in immune cellular composition, function, and signaling locally and systemically.
Lastly, we aim to identify the role of the epigenetic regulator JMJD3 in modulation of macrophage phenotype
and function in periodontitis. Taken together, several notable conceptual and methodological innovations have
been introduced in this application to move the field forward. The proposed studies, with a focus on health
disparities, will assist in increasing our understanding of the pathogenesis of periodontitis and its link with T2DM.

Alopecia Areata (AA) is a chronic autoimmune disease of the hair follicle that results in hair loss. The exact cause
of AA is unknown, genetic predisposition and environmental triggers might play important roles in the disease.
We previously identified CD8+NKG2D+ T cells as the key pathogenic drivers in AA and our findings led to
targeting pathogenic CD8+ T cells through blocking the gamma chain signaling pathway with JAK inhibitors in
AA treatment. Recently, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) together with single-cell TCR
sequencing (scTCRseq), and found that the most highly clonally expanded CD8+NKG2D+ T cells were also
positive for the inhibitory receptor, NKG2A. NKG2D is a critical activating receptor in both innate and adaptive
immune responses.. In contrast, the inhibitory receptor NKG2A, along with its co-receptor, CD94, engages the
nonclassical MHC class I molecule HLA-E in humans, or the Qa-1 molecule in mice. Engagement of NKG2A
results in the attenuation of the effector activity of CD8+ T cells. Our discovery of clonally expanded
NKG2A+NKG2D+CD8+ T cells is profoundly significant in AA, since it provides a crucial new insight into the nature of
the dysregulated effector responses in AA. We postulate that the inhibitory signal from NKG2A/CD94 is not sufficient
to attenuate the ongoing immune response AA, and/or that the activating signals such as from NKG2D are too potent
to be suppressed by NKG2A signaling. The work outlined in this proposal will interrogate the role of NKG2A in AA
pathogenesis, the regulation of ligand expression in the hair follicle, and targeting NKG2A to enhance inhibitory
signaling and/or dampen the effector activity of NKG2A+NKG2D+CD8+ T cells as a potential therapeutic strategy
for disease. These studies will expand our knowledge of therapeutically enhancing signaling by inhibitory
receptors, such as NKG2A, in the setting of autoimmunity, where there is a clear knowledge gap. Our results
will have broad relevance to autoimmune diseases that share common genetic causes, common therapeutic
targets, and potentially common treatments with AA.

Efforts to effectively treat and control Plasmodium falciparum malaria in Africa now face the critical issue that
parasites in East African countries have acquired resistance to artemisinin (ART), the core component of the
primary first-line therapy combination therapy of artemether plus lumefantrine (LUM) known as Coartem. Recent
studies have observed the rapidly increasing prevalence of K13 mutations (C469Y, R561H, R622I and A675V)
in isolates from Uganda, Rwanda and Ethiopia, which associate with in vitro and in vivo ART resistance. Gene
editing studies have shown that K13 mutations alone are generally insufficient to mediate ART resistance in
African parasites, and alternative pathways to resistance are likely. Recent reports have also observed reduced
susceptibility to LUM in Northern Uganda, which may signal the impending loss of Coartem treatment efficacy in
this region that may well spread across Africa. Our study is designed to elucidate the genetic basis of emerging
multidrug resistance in Uganda and evaluate how resistance mediators can affect parasite proliferation and
transmission potential, as these factors govern the spread of ART resistance in high-transmission settings
frequently found in Africa. Our first aim is to study k13-mediated and k13-independent ART resistance in
Ugandan parasites, which will provide insight into the complex genetic architecture and elucidate alternate
mediators of resistance. We will achieve this by implementing two genetic crosses using the humanized FRG-
NOD mouse model. Our first cross will be between an ART-resistant K13 mutant Ugandan isolate and the drug-
sensitive NF54 African line to elucidate secondary genetic modulators that interact with k13 to generate
resistance. Our second cross will employ an ART-resistant K13 wild-type Ugandan isolate crossed with NF54 to
identify markers for ART resistance that evolved independently of k13. We will establish phenotypic and genomic
profiles of recombinant progeny and apply quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping to locate primary and secondary
determinants of ART resistance, confirm causal and secondary determinants using gene editing, and examine
their epistatic interactions. Our second aim is to understand the genetic basis of decreased LUM sensitivity in
Northern Uganda by exploiting the second cross, whose Ugandan parent displays high LUM IC50 values. Our
complementary genetic mapping approaches of applying bulk segregant analyses of recombinant pools coupled
with clone-based QTL mapping will identify candidate markers that we will validate using reverse genetics. Our
third aim is to study the impact of Ugandan K13 mutations and other resistance markers on parasite growth and
transmission to Anopheles vectors, and identify mutations that compensate for fitness defects in drug-resistant
lines. This will be achieved by measuring fitness using competitive growth mixed-culture assays and bulk
segregant analyses, and quantifying mosquito infectivity of edited mutant and wild-type isogenic lines. Our
findings will provide robust molecular markers to track and inform efforts to mitigate emerging multidrug
resistance in Africa and delineate the relationship between drug resistance, parasite fitness and transmission.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-PE) have become widespread
in recent years, posing a serious threat to the treatment of common bacterial infections. Increased use of "last
resort" carbapenem antibiotics to treat ESBL-PE infections has fueled the emergence of carbapenem-resistant
Enterobacterales. Whole genome sequencing (WGS)-based prediction of antibiotic resistance phenotypes may
enable early initiation of appropriate treatment options for ESBL-PE infections, including selection of
carbapenem-sparing beta-lactam regimens. However, existing genomic prediction models have had relatively
poor accuracy for predicting resistance to beta-lactams in ESBL-PE. The genetic environment of ESBL genes,
including their location in the bacterial genome and association with mobile genetic elements (MGEs), is
unaccounted for in these models. These structural factors may contribute to beta-lactam resistance by providing
promotors modulating the expression of ESBL genes and enabling their duplication and mobilization within and
between Gram-negative bacteria. We hypothesize that including MGEs in genomic prediction models will
improve detection of beta-lactam resistance phenotypes in ESBL-PE. The objectives of this proposal are to 1)
determine how MGEs modulate beta-lactam minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) in ESBL-PE and 2)
develop and optimize multivariate regression models for predicting beta-lactam resistance from WGS data in
ESBL-PE. Our multidisciplinary research team has the necessary expertise in bacterial genomics, molecular
biology, infectious diseases epidemiology, and biostatistics to ensure successful completion of the proposed
studies. To characterize the genetic environment of ESBL genes, we will take advantage of the ability of
nanopore WGS to resolve structurally complex genomic regions including MGEs and plasmids. We will test our
hypothesis through the following three aims: 1) we will comprehensively genotype and phenotype a large
collection of clinical ESBL-PE isolates (n=450) to test the association between specific MGE genotypes and
beta-lactam MICs; 2) we will evaluate potential mechanisms whereby MGEs may affect beta-lactam resistance
phenotypes, focusing on the role that MGE-associated promotors play in modulating ESBL gene expression and
the impact of ESBL gene copy number on beta-lactam MICs; 3) we will use machine learning to build and
optimize multivariate regression models incorporating MGE genotypes and other genetic factors to predict beta-
lactam resistance phenotypes and validate our resulting models in a prospective collection of 200 ESBL-PE
isolated from urine cultures. The development of rapid diagnostic methods that predict antibiotic treatment
options to ESBL-PE should be a research priority. In addition to determining how MGEs contribute to ESBL-PE
resistance phenotypes, the proposed research will help enable integration of nanopore WGS into surveillance
and diagnostic approaches to detect beta-lactam resistance in ESBL-PE and facilitate the selection of
appropriate carbapenem-sparing regimens for ESBL-PE infections using genomic prediction models.

 Sociality is a fundamental part of our rich life as social animals. Notably, abnormalities in social cognition
are a hallmark of various psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and autism. Understanding the social
brain, the neural basis of social behavior, is an essential step toward addressing these issues. One of the
building blocks of social cognition is social memory, which comprises familiarity, the sense that an individual was
previously encountered, and recollection, the detailed storage and recall of social episodes. However, these two
processes have conflicting computational requirements: while familiarity requires abstraction and generalization,
recollection involves the creation of specialized representations to efficiently memorize many complex, multi-
sensory experiences. The question of how the brain implements these two processes to achieve social memory
is still open. One hypothesis is that these two processes are simultaneously implemented, and used in synergy
to optimize memory, by the hippocampal-cortical network. Here, I will test this hypothesis using artificial neural
networks and neural recordings from mice and human subjects exposed to social stimuli.
 In the first aim, I will analyze data from the entorhinal cortex (EC), the main input region to the hippocampus,
of mice interacting with familiar and novel conspecifics and compare it to previous hippocampal data to reveal the
specific roles of these regions during social cognition. In the second aim, I will develop a modular computational
model inspired by the connectivity structure of the hippocampus with the EC and the neocortex, and use it to test
how specialization and abstraction can be used in synergy to achieve efficient memory. This model will be trained
to reproduce the mouse data and used to make testable predictions on how social representations in hippocampal
and cortical regions change during learning. Finally, in the third aim, I will extend the analysis to human cognition
by first analyzing previous single-cell recordings of human patients exposed to familiar and novel faces. I will
then co-design a new experiment to reveal the coordinated change of the neural code in simultaneously-recorded
hippocampal and cortical regions and directly test how the synergy between abstraction and specialization can
improve memory.
 Given my quantitative training and extensive experience in collaborating with experimentalists, I am in a unique
position to conduct this work at the interface between computational modeling and cross-species data analysis.
The K99 phase of this work will take place at the Zuckerman Institute at Columbia University, a vibrant and immer-
sive scientific hub hosting world-class theoreticians and experimental neuroscientists. Thanks to the mentorship
of Drs. Fusi, Siegelbaum, and Rutishauser, all of whom are leaders in their fields, this project will allow me to
complete my training and start an independent group in interdisciplinary computational neuroscience.

Research: Despite the recent groundbreaking discoveries in the field of nanomedicine, tumor-specific delivery
of therapeutics still poses a big hurdle for translation of nanoparticle-based approaches. Engineered bacteria
have recently emerged as a novel delivery vehicle against cancer by producing therapeutics such as bacterial
toxins and checkpoint blockade to take advantage of their capability to produce therapeutics in situ. However,
their therapeutic efficacy has been limited against tumors and unable to accommodate non-biological
therapies. This project aims to understand interaction between bacteria and nanoparticles in tumor
microenvironment to enable coordination of these two platforms for cancer therapy through synergy between
synthetic biology and nanomedicine. Aim 1 will engineer bacteria to reprogram tumor microenvironment to
enhance penetration of nanoparticles. Bacteria will be programmed to reorganize aberrant extracellular matrix
of tumor by producing proteases and inhibitor of the upstream pathway. Aim 2 will program in situ interaction
between nanoparticles and bacteria for enhanced delivery of nanoparticles in tumor. Bacteria will be
engineered to display peptide tag that nanoparticle can target, and this programmable interaction will allow
spatial coordination between bacteria and nanoparticles for drug delivery. The data generated here will reflect
potential opportunities and challenges of combining two platforms to create biohybrid systems for cancer
therapy. The completion of these aims will generate strategies to program bacteria and nanoparticles that can
spatially and temporally coordinate with each other to develop biohybrid cancer therapy.
Candidate: Jaeseung Hahn, PhD, is a postdoctoral research scientist at Columbia University. Dr. Hahn
obtained his PhD in Medical Engineering and Medical Physics through the Harvard-MIT joint program. The
proposed career development plan will augment his previous training to prepare his independent career: (1)
experiential learning in synthesis of therapeutic nanoparticles, (2) technical experience in design and
construction of bacterial gene circuits, (3) scientific knowledge and technical skills in cancer and immunology,
and (4) leadership and professional skills for transition to independence.
Mentors/Environment: Dr. Hahn has assembled a strong team of mentor (Kam Leong), co-mentor (Tal
Danino), and collaborators (Nicholas Arpaia, Simone Schürle, Kenneth Olive, Minah Kim) to guide him through
the proposed research and training activities. The proposed career development plan utilizes expertise of the
mentorship team and intellectual and technical resources available through Columbia University. In addition,

necessary training. Columbia University is committed to supporting postdoctoral research scientists through
various courses, workshop, and professional development seminars organized by Office of Postdoctoral
Affairs. All mentors have agreed to meet biannually to ensure Dr. Hahn’s progress toward training goals.

The number of Americans aged 65+ living with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) is
projected to double in the next 30-40 years, particularly for minoritized groups, widening existing
disparities in ADRD. Poor financial wellbeing is a major source of stress, and the cumulative impacts
of financial strain may harm cognition. Life course experiences of financial strain are common,
especially for adults from minoritized groups (e.g., Black Americans) who often also face greater ADRD
burden. Given the pervasiveness of life course financial stressors in the U.S. and growing financial
disparities for groups inequitably burdened by ADRD, there is a critical need to examine how and when
poor financial wellbeing harms cognition and contributes to ADRD risk and disparities over the life
course. The central hypothesis of this application is that poor financial wellbeing across the life course,
particularly starting in early life, increases risk of cognitive decline and ADRD. Stress likely plays a role,
as financial hardship causes stress which may accelerate biological aging and, in turn, lead to cognitive
decline. Interventions to improve financial wellbeing would likely reduce ADRD burden, but what such
interventions should be and when they should occur is unclear. Previous research has lacked the
longitudinal data ideally suited to answer these questions. Leveraging three datasets that, together,
span the life course, the scientific objective of this study is to (Aim 1) build a synthetic cohort to examine
(Aim 2) the life course relationship between financial wellbeing and ADRD outcomes and disparities,
(Aim 3) its potential mechanism via biological aging, and (Aim 4) the components and timing of
hypothetical interventions to reduce ADRD burden and disparities associated with poor financial
wellbeing. The proposed work will use data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult
Health (ages: 12-43), Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (ages: 18-60), and the Health
and Retirement Study (ages: 50-100+). The research addresses NIA strategic directions to better
understand social determinants of ADRD across the life span and their mechanisms. Understanding
how and when financial wellbeing most impacts cognition could inform actionable strategies to reduce
ADRD burden, especially among financially disadvantaged groups. Complementing this research plan
is a training plan that builds on the applicant’s background and prior training in life course epidemiology
and foundational causal inference theory and includes new training in 1) applied data fusion and
advanced causal inference techniques, 2) financial wellbeing and social policy, 3) neuroscience and
measurement of ADRD, and 4) biological aging. The strong mentorship team and research and training
plans will prepare the applicant for a successful independent research career investigating the life
course timing and pathways via which socioeconomic stressors harm cognition and impact ADRD risk.

In the United States, 10% of infants are born before 37 weeks’ gestation and considered premature. Although
survival has improved, preterm infants remain at increased risk for impairment in neurodevelopment, including
language development. Nearly 35% of infants born between 31- and 34-weeks’ gestation and 50% of infants
born at fewer than 30 weeks’ gestation demonstrate compromised auditory memory and expressive and
receptive language, which persist into adolescence. It is hypothesized that prematurity, which often results in
physiologic insults and white matter injury, as well as the atypical auditory environment of the Neonatal
Intensive Care Unit (NICU) impact language development during critical periods. The aberrant auditory
environment is of particular interest because it can be modified to promote experience-dependent plasticity and
improve long-term language outcomes in premature infants. The primary objective of this K23 Mentored
Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award is to characterize the influence of the NICU’s sensory
environment on auditory processing of maternal voice as well as auditory cortex maturation and circuitry while
accounting for variables known to influence language development including gestational age, sex, medical
condition, socioeconomic status, and maternal stress and depression. To achieve this, Dr. Hammond will
recruit a group of pregnant women and their fetuses who are subsequently born at term and a group of
premature infants. In the first aim, attention to maternal voice will be compared in fetuses and premature
infants using HR responses to a maternal voice stimulus. In the second aim, auditory recognition memory for
maternal voice and auditory cortex maturation will be compared in term and preterm infants using auditory
event-related potentials. In the third aim, infants born preterm and at term will return at a corrected age of two
months and resting-state functional connectivity in the language regions of the brain will be compared. In all
three aims, the impact of characteristics of the auditory environments in utero and in the NICU on these
outcomes will also be evaluated. The findings from the proposed work will advance the field of developmental
neuroscience’s understanding of critical periods for language development and will identify the characteristics
of the auditory environment that promote or impede language development. The results will be used to design
developmentally-appropriate interventions in the NICU that improve the outcomes of premature infants.
Through the proposed work, Dr. Jennifer Hammond, a clinical neonatologist, will acquire mentored training in
developmental neuroscience as well as neurobehavioral, neurophysiologic, and neuroimaging assessments of
fetal and infant brain development to become a successful, independent physician-scientist. Dr. Hammond will
have the support of a rich institutional environment and the commitment of her mentorship team including Dr.
Catherine Monk, Dr. Patricia Kuhl, and Dr. Rachel Marsh, who will ensure that she transitions to independence
and becomes a leader in the fields of developmental neuroscience and neonatology.

The long-term goal of this project is to determine molecular mechanisms of heteromeric ionotropic
glutamate receptor (iGluR) gating and modulation by ligands and auxiliary subunits. iGluRs are
ligand-gated, tetrameric ion channels that mediate fast neurotransmission in the central nervous
system (CNS). iGluRs are critical for learning and memory, and their mis-regulation is implicated
in neurological disorders like epilepsy and Alzheimer’s disease. The α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-
4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR), the fastest subtype of the iGluR family, assembles
as a tetrameric combination of four distinct, principal subunits, GluA1 to GluA4. AMPARs can be
further classified into GluA2-containing, Ca2+-impermeable (CI) receptors, and GluA2-lacking,
Ca2+-permeable (CP) receptors, which are involved in Ca2+ influx-mediated excitotoxicity. While it
is known that AMPAR formation is primarily heteromeric in the CNS, most research has focused
on homomeric assemblies. Furthermore, AMPARs co-assemble with a broad range of structurally
diverse auxiliary subunits that regulate their synaptic localization, trafficking, pharmacology, and
ion permeation. Structural and functional characterization of heteromeric AMPARs, CP-AMPARs
and their complexes with auxiliary subunits, which regulate the vast majority of excitatory
neurotransmission in glutamatergic synapses and are involved in devastating neurological
diseases, thus representing promising pharmacological targets, will provide novel insights into
iGluR function in physiological conditions as well as aid in the rational design of therapeutics
targeting these receptors in disease states. We will study AMPAR structure and function with the
following Specific Aims: Aim 1. Determine the high-resolution cryo-EM structure of heteromeric
AMPARs. Aim 2. Characterize structure and function of Ca2+-permeable AMPARs in complex
with auxiliary subunit transmembrane AMPAR regulatory protein (TARP) ɣ7. To achieve these
goals, we will use a combination of biophysical and biochemical methods, including the
fluorescence-detection size-exclusion chromatography (FSEC), whole-cell patch-clamp and
single-channel recordings, and cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). Our results will uncover the
molecular basis of heteromeric iGluR gating and inhibition, provide new insight into translational
pharmacology and aid in the development of treatment of devastating neurological disorders.

In 2020, U.S. electricity customers faced an average of 8 hours without power, the longest duration on record.
Climate change is expected to cause more severe weather events, which can damage electricity grids and dis-
tribution pathways. Outages may be particularly problematic for cardiovascular health, as they disrupt access to
temperature-controlling tools (e.g., air conditioners, fans). Climate change will also result in higher temperatures,
which can exacerbate cardiovascular disease (CVD). CVD affects 126.9 million American adults and is the lead-
ing cause of death and disability in the U.S., with communities color and socially marginalized communities
disproportionately affected. Understanding the impact of power outages on CVD and how this relationship varies
across community sociodemographic characteristics is central to climate and environmental justice. A critical
research gap remains about the health effects of power outages generally and the extent to which they affect
acute CVD risk. Partly due to the lack of high spatiotemporal resolution measures for outage exposure, most
prior studies have not measured neighborhood-level electricity availability. Additionally, previous studies did not
consider the potential dual threat when outages co-occur with anomalous temperatures or whether certain com-
munities may be particularly vulnerable to the effect of power outages. In particular, we will consider whether
individuals living in communities with higher social vulnerability or more racial/economic segregation experience
worse CVD outcomes after power outages. We will use 2017-2020 New York Statewide Planning and Research
Co-operative System (SPARCS) hospitalization data and 30-minute resolution power outage data within 1,831
power operating units statewide to fill this gap. Using diagnostic codes, we will identify hourly hospitalizations for
the acute cardiovascular outcomes, myocardial infarction and stroke. We plan to implement case-crossover
study designs with conditional logistic models, which inherently control for non-time-varying individual-level con-
founding variables. Our overarching hypothesis is that more outage hours are associated with increased risk of
CVD hospitalizations, particularly during anomalous temperature events, and that there will be disparities in this
exposure-response relationship across area-level vulnerability and segregation. We aim to (1) investigate the
association between power outages and CVD hospitalizations, (2) determine the impacts of exposure to power
outages during anomalously hot and anomalously cold temperature events separately on CVD hospitalizations,
and (3) identify communities vulnerable to the effects of outages on CVD. This research supports the NIEHS
Strategic Plan to evaluate co-exposures and considers issues of environmental justice. Collectively, we will pro-
vide crucial information that can inform future climate adaptation policies to reduce CVD-related morbidity in an
equitable manner.

Human parainfluenza viruses (HPIV) cause significant lower respiratory diseases, including croup, bronchiolitis,
and pneumonia, that lead to illness or death in millions of infants and young children worldwide. Viral infection is
initiated when the viral fusion complex, comprised of the surface glycoproteins HN (receptor-binding protein;
hemagglutinin-neuraminidase) and F (fusion protein), mediates fusion upon HN engaging sialic acid receptor.
Bound-HN triggers F to undergo conformational rearrangements that promote viral entry when F is sufficiently
close to insert into the host membrane. To mediate fusion, the fusion protein precursor (F0) must first be cleaved
by host proteases into its active form. F0 cleavage has been thought to be executed intracellularly by the
ubiquitously expressed furin, because F0 contains a dibasic cleavage site. However, the sponsor’s laboratory
found that the dibasic cleavage site underlying the assumption is an artifact of laboratory adaptation, whereas
circulating strains of HPIV3 have a monobasic cleavage site that is cut by an unidentified extracellular protease
in the lung. F0 cleavage by extracellular proteases opens the possibility that catalytic activation of F may be
delayed until a target cell is reached, thereby enabling the fusion protein to remain in a more stable uncleaved
state until reaching specific protease expressing target cells. The goal of this proposal is to identify the
proteases required for HPIV3 spread in the human lung and novel mechanisms by which the virus exploits these
proteases to selectively target cells, proliferate in the respiratory system, and survive host-to-host transmission.
Aim 1 will identify host proteases that are necessary for circulating HPIV3 F0 cleavage and assess the impact
of their expression on viral tropism in authentic lung models.
Aim 2 will determine how the timing of F cleavage affects fusion efficiency, and how a delay in F cleavage until
the time of infection may enable virions to evade inactivation of the viral fusion machinery by host factors during
traversal of the human respiratory tract.
The proposed project employs an array of cell biological, biochemical, and imaging techniques to apply
complementary, yet independent approaches for understanding critical host protease determinants of HPIV3
infectivity and novel viral mechanisms for maintaining fusion protein functionality. The breadth of approaches will
contribute to the project’s scientific rigor, since each question will be answered in several different ways, and
provide technical and theoretical learning opportunities. By the time of completion, this project will have identified
F cleaving proteases, characterized the role of cleavage in regulating F activity, and explored the broader
implications of F0 for viral evasion of virucidal host factors, like mucins. Data gleaned from these studies will
clarify an essential step of HPIV life cycles and our overall understanding of the HN-F viral fusion machinery. For
these reasons, the project serves as an ideal training vehicle, providing an interdisciplinary path to greater
independence.

 Real-life decisions are often context-dependent. For example, a motorist may decide to slow down at a
yellow traffic light if a police car is nearby or accelerate if the intersection is empty. The ability to use contextual
information to flexibly guide decisions is a critical component of higher-order cognition that is often impaired in
psychiatric conditions like schizophrenia. To facilitate the identification of potential therapies for these
disorders, scientists have investigated the brain bases of context-dependent decision-making in humans and
animal models. Whole-brain functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies in humans have identified
areas in the frontal and parietal cortices that appear to maintain contextual information so it can be used to
guide subsequent decisions. However, fMRI alone cannot reveal the causal and cellular-level roles of these
areas in context-dependent decision-making, and this level of understanding is critical for the development of
novel therapeutics. As such, studying the neurobiology of context maintenance and other higher-order
cognitive processes in mice will be crucial for guiding research on new therapies for human disorders.
However, it is still unclear (1) what areas across the mouse brain contribute to the maintenance of contextual
information and (2) how activity in these areas shapes activity in decision-making regions and behavior. The
aims of this proposal leverage the global coverage of fMRI and the extensive genetic toolkit available in mice to
answer these questions. Aim 1 uses a novel platform for behaving mouse fMRI to image mice as they
complete a task that requires them to maintain contextual information in order to receive rewards. Comparing
brain activity during this task to activity in a nearly identical task that does not rely on contextual information will
identify areas that are involved in the maintenance of contextual information across the brain. Aim 2 uses
optogenetics and two-photon microscopy to silence activity in one of these potential context maintenance
areas to determine how it causally contributes to cellular-level activity in a decision-making area and task
performance. Together, these experiments will unveil new neural substrates of context-dependent decision-
making and suggest potential treatment targets for future pre-clinical studies of psychiatric illness.
 This proposal was tailored to both exploit my existing expertise in whole-brain imaging and facilitate my
acquisition of new technical skills and professional competencies that will advance me towards my goal of
becoming an independent physician-scientist. Dr. Michael Shadlen, an expert in perceptual decision-making,
and Dr. Itamar Kahn, an expert in behaving mouse fMRI, are the ideal pair of sponsors for this project, and the
vibrant scientific and clinical communities at Columbia make this the ideal place for me to pursue this training.

The poor thermostability of vaccines is the most notable factor for their inequitable global distribution. The cold
chain system imposes a substantial barrier for equitable global access to safe and potent vaccines. To eliminate
or improve this vaccine coverage gap, minimizing the costly and labor-intensive cold chain process is a critical
need, which would potentially lead to a major reduction of vaccine wastage. We intend to develop tools for cost-
effective ambient temperature storage of vaccines without requiring refrigeration or complicated sample recovery
protocols for extended durations. This work will introduce the possibility of improving global vaccine access via
offering an innovative approach capable of reducing the costs of vaccine storage and deployment, thereby over-
coming vaccine shortage and equity issues.
 We aim to develop new natural deep eutectic solvents (NatDESs), highly polar and molecularly-tunable or-
ganic materials with generally recognized as safe (GRAS) toxicity profiles to improve the thermostability of two
important proven vaccine platforms: 1) yellow fever virus as a lipid enveloped, positive sense RNA virus; 2)
adenovirus as protein capsid, double stranded DNA virus. The proposed formulations will offer a well-suited
platform on which the properties can be readily altered by the selection of ions, enabling the tunable design of
media for the long-term stabilization of these vaccine platforms. We expect that the solutions of proposed
NatDESs with up to 20 wt% water will prevent hydrolytic and enzymatic degradation of viral genomes and protein
capsids, promoting high levels of protection for the viral models.
 In Aim 1, we will develop a diverse series of novel NatDESs through systematic variations of quaternary
ammonium cations, biocompatible anions, and bio-sourced sugars and polyols. To gain in-depth understanding
of binding characteristics and molecular mechanisms of interactions in viral samples, we will conduct empirical
structure-property-function relationship studies using a combination of simulation and X-ray crystallographic
methods. In Aim 2, we will examine their utility for stabilizing viral samples via evaluating their structural integrity,
thermostability, and shelf-life by monitoring changes in viral secondary structure, thermal denaturation, and par-
ticle morphology. This approach has great potential to resolve the cold chain problem and in turn positively
impact global health, coverage and equity, and economic cost, compared to the current technologies.
 This application will address the key objectives of the AREA (R15) grant mechanism through supporting
meritorious research, exposing undergraduate students to research, and strengthening the research environ-
ment of two primarily undergraduate institutions. These activities include instruction and the mentoring of women,
first-generation, and underrepresented minority students.

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is one of the most devastating blood cancers, and it affects around one million people and
results in 147,000 deaths per year worldwide. AML is characterized by the abnormal production of myeloid lineage of blood
cells and the rapid growth of leukemia blasts in bone marrow and peripheral blood. AML is a very aggressive cancer, and
it progresses rapidly and AML patients become fatal within weeks to months. Currently, therapeutic options for AML are
very limited. Only about 35% of AML patients under 60 years-old and 10% over 60 years-old benefit from standard
chemotherapy. Thus, there is an urgent and unmet medical need to develop new therapeutic approaches particularly
combination therapies with advanced efficacy and reduced toxicity for AML patients. Our long-term goals of the proposed
research are to study abnormal vitamin pathways as metabolic dependencies in AML, to investigate critical regulators of
vitamin pathways in supporting AML cell aberrant proliferation, and to identify druggable therapeutic targets in AML. We
have recently uncovered vitamin B6 pathway as a novel dependency in AML. Based on this finding, we hypothesize that
vitamin B6 pathway is a specific anti-leukemia target and has promising therapeutic potential to treat AML. To assess the
hypothesis, we have identified multiple key enzymes in vitamin B6 dependent metabolic pathways essential for AML cell,
but not for normal bone marrow hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell and immune cell, proliferation. Depletion of these
key enzymes exhibited robust inhibition on AML proliferation. We have also validated vitamin B6 pathway as a
pharmacologically actionable pathway and showed that vitamin B6 pathway inhibitors exhibit promising therapeutic
efficacy in multiple genetically engineered AML models in vivo. These robust preliminary data encourage us to pursue three
Specific Aims to further characterize vitamin B6 pathway: 1) to characterize both upstream and downstream regulators of
vitamin B6 pathway in AML; 2) to evaluate the synergy between vitamin B6 pathway and BCL-2 in AML therapeutics to
further enhance its efficacy; and 3) to perform functional genomics screens to identify vitamin B6 pathway synergistic
effectors in AML. We propose to study AML from the aspect of vitamin B6 pathway and metabolic programming, a process
which is novel and essential for AML cell proliferation. The proposed research will be focusing on both mechanistic
understanding and therapeutic targeting of vitamin B6 pathway in association with different synergistic effectors in AML.
The major goals of this proposal are to identify the unique vitamin B6 upstream regulators and downstream effectors as
well as its synergistic effectors to treat AML. The proposal is significant because it will not only uncover the underlying
mechanism but also pinpoint therapeutic targets to synergistically enhance the anti-leukemia effects in AML.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Discovery and development of artificial nucleic acid ligands to probe cellular interactions
The regulation followed by measurement of cellular events, such as intercellular communication, receptor-
ligand interactions, and inter-receptor interactions using molecular tools, will expand our understanding of
cellular decision-making mediated by cell surface receptors. Owing to their synthetic nature and compatibility
with a variety of nano-materials, nucleic acid aptamers are well suited as specific recognition probes for
incorporation into such tools. Aptamers are single-stranded DNA/RNA/XNA (X= nonstandard nucleic acid
base) sequences that bind to a specific target with high affinity and specificity. However, because of their low
solubility in aqueous media, purified cell-surface receptors do not make good targets for in vitro screening of
aptamer ligands. Additionally, in response to ligand binding, cell surface receptors act in concert, forming
transient complexes. Such complexes are hard to constitute in artificial buffer systems while maintaining their
native fold. This means that conventional approaches to aptamer-ligand screening may not lead to aptamers
that are translatable. Addressing this need, the Mallikaratchy Lab recently pioneered a technology termed
Ligand-guided Selection or LIGS to identify functional aptamers from a SELEX (Systematic Evolution of
Ligands by EXponential enrichment) library, against known multi-domain cell surface targets in their native
functional state. LIGS uses the same combinatorial library but takes advantage of characteristics inherent to
SELEX. For example, it is known that the iterative process in conventional SELEX is designed to outcompete
low-affinity binders through a competitive process whereby high-affinity binders move through an increasingly
selective process. LIGS exploits this competition between weak and strong binders in a combinatorial library by
introducing a stronger, known high-affinity secondary ligand, e.g., a monoclonal antibody (mAb), against the
target of interest to outcompete and replace highly specific aptamers. These aptamers can recognize their
target receptors in cultured and clinical samples specifically. Building on our initial work on LIGS, the first goal
of this MIRA is to extend the types of interactions utilized in LIGS to naturally induced conformational switches
of membrane proteins of mechanistic/functional interest to discover artificial ligands based on aptamers against
them. The second goal explores chemical interventions to understand aptamer folding using bioorthogonal
approaches, such as click-chemistry, to facilitate proximity mediated intra-molecular cross-linking. Additionally,
we plan to engineer functional aptamer scaffolds to regulate cell-cell and receptor-ligand interactions using
aptamers already identified using LIGS, explicitly focusing on the modulation of TCR-CD3ε in T-cells. A
successful outcome to these goals will result in aptamers able to probe receptor interactions along with
integrated nano-materials enhancing the application of aptamers in biomedicine while providing insights into
the modulation of cell receptor biology in cellular decision making.

Notwithstanding decades of work on the mechanisms and applications of transcranial direct current stimulation
(tDCS), the translation of tDCS to a broadly-used and meaningful therapy is halted. We propose that this is a
result of three factors that will be addressed in this proposal. First, the intensity of stimulation has remained
limited; Second, there is a lack of clarity as to whether stimulation should be paired with a specific behavioral
task; and third, there is a lack of consensus on the underlying mechanisms of action. We have shown in vitro
that electric field stimulation can polarize neurons in proportion to the applied field, which interacts with
concurrent induction of synaptic plasticity, and is thus functionally specific. In light of this, tDCS should inherit
the specificity of concurrent behavioral training and effects should scale with intensity. This hypothesis will be
tested here in parallel human and rat experiments in the context of motor learning. Aim 1 is to test the
prediction that stimulation has to be concurrent to behavioral motor learning, and effects scale with intensity
and reverse with polarity. In humans we will test this with a newly-developed electrode montage that achieves
the highest field-intensities on the motor cortex to-date, resulting in strong effect sizes for motor sequence
learning. For rats, we will use a new stimulation protocol with strong effects on learning in a pellet-reaching
task. Aim 2 is to test the prediction, in humans and rats, that effects are specific to the stimulated motor cortex
and, in humans, that effects are specific to the trained task. Outcome measures will be motor learning and
motor cortex excitability (motor-evoked potentials). Aim 3 is to test the hypothesis in rats that behavioral
benefits of tDCS are associated with spatially specific functional and structural changes in the motor cortex
(measured with 2D motor map and synaptic markers), and causally depends on modulation of motor cortex
activity (controlled with chemogenetic inactivation). The outcomes of these experiments, regardless of whether
they confirm or refute the basic hypothesis, will directly address the factors that are limiting progress. By
emphasizing rigor this project will yield robust go-to experiments that can serve as standard tools for future
exploration. By focusing on motor learning, the work is immediately applicable to motor rehabilitation.

Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is the most sensitive imaging modality for breast cancer diagnosis to date.
Women with a strong family history or related genetic mutations have an elevated risk of breast cancer and are
recommended to participate in yearly MRI screenings. However, the rate of detection in this high-risk cohort is
small, prompting a desire to reduce unnecessary MRI exams. The basic hypothesis of this project is that within
the screening cohort the individual risk of a future cancer can be estimated based on the appearance of breast
MRI and mammograms today. In preliminary work we have already identified low-risk women that could have
omitted a screening session without missing a new cancer. The discovery of this lower-risk subgroup was
made possible by modern deep-learning tools developed in preliminary work. Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer
Center (MSK) has accrued a database of approximately 70,000 breast MRI exams over 18 years along with
the patients’ clinical outcomes. This unprecedented resource enables the training of modern machine learning
“from the ground-up” to extract and classify volumetric MRI features. The specific aims of this project are as
follows. Aim 1 (Data curation): Systematic analysis of the large dataset accrued at MSK requires careful
curation including image content, image quality, pathology results, clinical follow-up, as well as demographic
and genomic information. The outcome of this Aim is a curated dataset that can broadly benefit future technical
efforts in breast diagnosis. Aim 2 (Deep learning): To make risk stratification quantitative we propose to
analyze the MRI scans using modern deep networks that have been trained to identify the location and extent
of a cancer. We will then transfer the MRI features of these trained networks as well as networks trained on
mammograms to the task of diagnosis and risk assessment. The intended outcome of this Aim are predictive
models with human-level performance at diagnosis and segmentation. Aim 3 (Risk adjusted screening): To
reduce the burden of screening while maintaining sensitivity we will estimate the risk of finding a malignant
tumor in the future, based on the present MRI exam and most recent mammogram as well as patient
information. The machine-estimated risk will be used in a retrospective analysis to determine the primary
outcome, namely, the number of exams that could have been omitted by scheduling a longer screening interval
without compromising sensitivity. This will be repeated on newly accrued data at MSK, Duke and Johns
Hopkins University (JHU) as secondary sites. Once validated, the risk-prediction model will be publicly
released to encourage data sharing and clinical adoption. The preliminary work performed over the last two
years has brought together a unique interdisciplinary team including clinical investigators on breast MRI at
MSK, and machine-learning and medical imaging experts at CCNY, Duke and JHU. The platform technology
that will be developed here is applicable beyond breast cancer, and the transfer learning approach applicable
in particular to cancers with more limited datasets.

The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is an organelle that houses factors that assist proteins in their folding and
supports the formation of stabilizing covalent modifications. Perturbation of ER functions results in
evolutionarily conserved cell stress, the unfolded protein response (UPR). Recent studies have indicated the
critical role of ER stress in diabetes-induced cardiac cell death. However, a pathway connecting hyperglycemia
to downstream events of UPR has remained elusive. Here, we present preliminary data demonstrating that
Arrestin Domain-Containing protein 4 (Arrdc4) is a glucose-responsive protein that mediates ER stress and
cardiac dysfunction in diabetes mellitus. Arrdc4 is a member of the ancient family of arrestin-fold proteins with
conserved roles in regulating nutrient transporter trafficking as adaptor proteins. We have found that Arrdc4
expression is robustly upregulated by high glucose in cardiomyocytes. Arrdc4 binds to the basal glucose
transporter 1 (GLUT1), induces its endocytosis, and blocks cellular glucose uptake. Arrdc4-mediated glucose
deprivation leads to the activation of UPR in cardiomyocytes, revealing a unique function of Arrdc4 in
cardiomyocyte metabolism and survival. To define the in vivo function of Arrdc4, we generated and
characterized a systemic Arrdc4-knockout (KO) mouse model. In this animal model, Arrdc4-KO mice have
fasting hypoglycemia, and Arrdc4-KO hearts exhibit a robust increase in myocardial glucose uptake without
insulin stimulation. Furthermore, deletion of Arrdc4 reduces ER stress during the development of diabetic
cardiomyopathy and protects the heart against cardiomyocyte apoptosis in type 1 diabetes. These results
define the outlines of an Arrdc4-GLUT1-UPR pathway that provides a strong link between hyperglycemia and
cardiomyocyte survival. This project aims to delineate the molecular nature of this pathway and tests its role in
the pathogenesis of diabetic cardiomyopathy. Aim 1 will test three non-exclusive hypotheses by which high
glucose induces ER stress: (a) Arrdc4 is a target of the glucose-sensing transcriptional mechanism, (b) Arrdc4
sensitizes cardiomyocytes to ER stress by energy insufficiency through GLUT1 inhibition, and (c) Arrdc4 may
even promote ER stress through a mechanism beyond GLUT1 interaction. Aim 2a will characterize the cardiac
metabolic phenotype in the type 2 diabetic model to determine whether Arrdc4-KO mouse hearts are protected
from proteotoxic apoptosis. Moreover, Aim 2b will test the hypothesis that the beneficial effect of Arrdc4
deficiency in diabetes is cardiac autonomous or secondary to the glycemic control by skeletal muscle using our
newly-generated inducible, tissue-specific Arrdc4-KO mice, focusing on the significance of Arrdc4 in exercise
intolerance, an independent predictor of poor prognosis in diabetes. These studies are highly innovative as we
propose a pathway that has never been entertained as a cardiac stress regulator in diabetes. The resulting
knowledge will provide a new mechanistic basis for understanding the defense mechanism to protect
cardiomyocytes against diabetic insults. Based on the novelty of the study, this application is highly significant.

My research program aims to make sense of modern genomic data through the lens of molecular evolution.
Drawing from ideas and techniques in statistics, artificial intelligence, and population genetics, we seek both to
understand the evolutionary forces that have shaped present-day genome sequences, and to use evolutionary
patterns to gain insight into the phenotypic importance of particular genomic sequences, with broad implications
for human health. Our work focuses in particular on three major areas: (1) evolutionary reconstruction based on
genome sequences; (2) inference of the fitness consequences of human mutations; and (3) the study of
transcriptional regulation and its evolution in mammals.
In the last funding period (2018–2022), we achieved major advances in each of these areas, including both
methodological advances and applications of new methods to important and timely scientific questions. For
example, we recently developed innovative new methods for the inference of ancestral recombination graphs
(ARGs) from multi-population sequence data; for the detection of selective sweeps using ARGs and deep neural
networks; for the identification of essential genes from CRISPR-Cas9 screens; for the estimation of relative RNA
half-lives based on widely available RNA-sequencing data types; and for the detection of gains and losses of
cis-regulatory elements along the branches of a phylogeny based on epigenomic data. These methods have all
been implemented as publicly available software tools. Based on these and other methods, we published a
variety of novel scientific findings, including the discovery and characterization of previously unknown
introgression events between modern and archaic hominins; a genomic analysis of South American birds
indicating their radiation was primarily driven by recent selective sweeps; an analysis indicating extensive
evidence of rapid evolution in immunity- and cancer-related genes in bats; and an analysis indicating that
enhancers are gained and lost at about twice the rate of promoters in mammalian evolution. These findings were
described in a total of 17 original papers and preprints.
For this renewal application, we propose to continue our research within each of these three key areas. Specific
goals include developing new statistical sampling methods that scale to very large ARGs; using domain
adaptation to reduce training bias in population genomics; measuring extreme levels of purifying selection from
patterns of rare variation in human populations; characterizing the distributions of fitness effects for polygenic
traits; identifying and characterizing deleterious variants linked to advantageous alleles; and developing a unified
biophysical modeling framework for nascent RNA sequencing data with applications to comparative genomics
and elongation-rate estimation. A renewal of R35 funding will enable us to remain highly productive contributors
to this critically important research area.

CSHL Laboratory Course in Advanced Techniques in Molecular Neuroscience
The proposed Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL) course Advanced Techniques in Molecular
Neuroscience (ATMN), to be held annually in July 2020– 2024, is part of the CSHL's postgraduate
training program in neurobiology. ATMN is a short, intensive sixteen day hands-on course which
prepares students to enter directly into research that makes use of advanced and/or specialized
molecular techniques in contemporary aspects of neurobiological research. Experimental modules in
the course will include quantitative assays of RNAs bound to protein by crosslinking
immunoprecipitation (CLIP), translating mRNA isolation from specified neural subtypes (TRAP), tissue
clearing methodologies combined with single RNA molecule detection by hybridization chain reaction
(HCR), preparation of pure astrocyte and neural progenitor cell cultures, design and use of engineered
viral vectors in neuroscience research, design and use of CRISPR/Cas genome editing tools, practical
exercises in gene delivery systems in vivo, genome-wide assessment of chromatin state and
transcription factor binding by ATACseq and Cut & Run, and use and design of BAC transgenic
vectors. Experimental techniques are taught in the context of the broader conceptual advances that
they may provide. The course invites lecturers who have made significant contributions in their fields to
give up-to-the-minute reports on current research. The trainees are chosen by the course faculty from
larger pools of applicants and range from graduate students to senior investigators and research
physicians. Because of the short duration of this course, senior, as well as junior individuals can attend
and receive a short, intense period of training in an environment remote from other demands on their
time and attention. The ATMN course also provides an unusual opportunity for established scientists to
apply these advanced techniques to their own research interests, or to retrain in an important specialty
within neuroscience with which they may not be familiar. Methods and concepts taught in the course
are disseminated to the wider research community through the publication of laboratory manuals and
online resources.

The goal of the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL) Postbaccalaureate Research Education
Program (PREP) is to increase the number of underrepresented minority (URM) students in the
biomedical sciences by preparing trainees for matriculation into highly competitive and rigorous
Ph.D. graduate programs and future success in science-related fields. CSHL PREP will provide
world-class research experience, professional development, and development of scientific
identity and community to its participants. Funding is requested for four PREP Scholars to
conduct a year of research in cancer and molecular biology, neuroscience, genetics and
genomics, quantitative biology, and plant biology, under the mentorship of a CSHL PREP
faculty member. Scholars will create an individual development plan that defines their research
interests, identifies relevant coursework, and establishes goals and timelines for their time in the
program and their future careers. They will participate in the Skills Development course,
designed exclusively for them, that includes writing and oral presentation workshops, and
guidance in preparing for graduate school applications. They will also attend the PREP
Bootcamp course to broaden their knowledge base in the biosciences. Scholars will have
numerous opportunities to develop their scientific identity and community. They will participate
in campus-wide seminars, meetings and journal clubs with their research laboratories, national
conferences, and the graduate student run Graduate Seminar Series. They will benefit from
having a Research Mentor, a Direct Mentor (a graduate student or postdoc in their research
laboratories) and a Near-Peer Mentor (a graduate student). These mentors will play an active
role in integrating the Scholars into the CSHL community, and help them build a scientific
network, such as with the approximately 12,000 scientists that visit CSHL annually to attend the
Meetings and Courses program. The PREP Committee will have oversight of CSHL PREP. The
committee will meet monthly with the Scholars at PREP Teas, and with the Scholar and their
Research Mentor in quarterly Progress Meetings. Moreover, the Program Director and Program
Coordinator will have Check-In meetings with individual Scholars monthly. Effectiveness of
CSHL PREP will be evaluated internally by CSHL’s School administrators and externally by
Barone Research Services through a combination of survey results, confidential reports by
Research Mentors, and exit interviews.

This proposal seeks support for the conference on Network Biology, to take place March/April
2021 to 2025, at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL). This meeting, held in biannual
rotation on the CSHL campus in New York, brings together senior and junior scientists from
both experimental and computational laboratories with common interests in network biology.
The meeting will emphasize new discoveries and provide an open forum for the presentation of
the latest research and results on molecular networks and their relevance to normal and
abnormal cellular physiology. It will be essential for advancing knowledge in all aspects of the
network modeling process, from data generation in experimental cell biology to data analysis
and computer simulation and from the development and validation of network models describing
these data to biological inferences made from the models. The conference will include platform
sessions on interaction networks, signaling and network dynamics, regulatory networks,
computational tools, artificial intelligence and big data, multi-scale networks, networks and
disease, networks in differentiation, microbiome networks, network evolution, synthetic
networks, network engineering and networks beyond biology though the exact program for the
meeting will be assembled after the abstract submission deadline in February 2021 and adapted
to ongoing developments in the field in subsequent years. This conference will include
significant components designed to facilitate the active participation of younger scientists such
as selection of platform speakers on the basis of the scientific merit of their submitted abstracts
as well as poster presentations, round tables, lightning talks and poster prizes. Distinguished
speakers will also be invited to give platform talks and interact with more junior scientists. The
intimate environment at CSHL fosters social interactions and active participation by all. The
majority of participants to the previous CSHL Network Biology meeting expressed that they
were “very satisfied”. Speakers' panels have consisted of at least 50% women; the gender
balance will be maintained in future meetings. In the 2019 iteration of the meeting, a panel
discussion was established to address the challenges of Women in Network Science. We will
continue to address big community challenges though panel discussions in this meeting. In
2021, we will discuss Applicability and Translatability of Network Biology with panelists including
network biologists whose work is deeply influential throughout the ongoing covid-19 pandemic.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
 The establishment of synaptic connectivity during brain development involves the initial formation of an
overabundance of synapses followed by a refinement process in which some of these synapses are maintained
while others are eliminated. The precise elimination of excess synapses is driven by sensory experience during
critical periods of early postnatal life. Impairments in sensory-dependent synapse elimination contribute to
neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism, underscoring the importance of this process for the proper
development and function of neural circuits. However, although neurodevelopmental disorders are growing in
prevalence at an alarming rate, therapeutic strategies for treating them are scarce in part due to a lack of insight
into the factors that control synapse elimination in the healthy brain. A key goal of this proposal is to uncover
novel cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the elimination of synapses downstream of experience,
thereby laying the groundwork for new therapeutic approaches to treat disorders of postnatal brain development.
 Work in the visual system of the mouse has revealed that non-neuronal brain cells, predominantly
microglia and astrocytes, coordinate synapse elimination before the onset of visual experience by phagocytosing
excess synapses. However, data suggest that these cells may not be major regulators of synapse elimination
during late phases of development that are coordinated by visual experience. On the contrary, we recently
discovered a key role for a less well understood class of glia, oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs), in
eliminating synapses in response to experience through synaptic phagocytosis. This result is consistent with
wide-spread speculation that OPCs, while predominantly appreciated for their differentiation into mature
oligodendrocytes, play key roles in the brain beyond myelination. In line with this possibility, our data suggest
that OPCs are essential for shaping functional neural circuits during the maturation of the brain.
 In this application, we propose a multi-disciplinary strategy to test the hypothesis that the engulfment of
synapses by OPCs is a core mechanism underlying the sensory-dependent elimination of functional synapses
in the developing brain. In Aim 1, we will employ viral and transgenic tools to characterize the spatio-temporal
dynamics and activity-dependent basis of synaptic engulfment by OPCs using in vivo two-photon microscopy. In
Aim 2, we will apply physiological and behavioral assays to determine the consequences of synaptic engulfment
by OPCs on brain function in the intact animal. In Aim 3, we will merge unbiased transcriptomic and CRISPR-
based screening techniques with a candidate-based approach focused on the phagocytic receptor Lrp1 to reveal
molecular pathways underlying the engulfment of synapses by OPCs. Altogether, we expect these studies to
establish synapse engulfment by OPCs as a new mechanism linking experience to neural circuit development,
and to lay the foundation for future studies geared toward modifying OPC function as a potential therapeutic
strategy for treating neurodevelopmental disorders.

Proper development and function of the neocortex, a brain structure critical for all higher-order functions, relies
on the tightly controlled migration of neocortical pyramidal (NP) neurons from their place of birth to their final
position in the developing neocortex. Once neurons reach their destination, they further mature and establish
functional connections. Significantly, defects in the migration of NP neurons are linked to neurodevelopmental
disorders (NDDs) of cognition and epilepsy, highlighting the importance of this process in neocortical
development and function. Yet, the molecular mechanisms that govern NP neuron migration and associated
brain disorders remain poorly understood. We recently uncovered that the multi-domain containing Rho-GAP
oligophrenin-1 (OPHN1) is prominently expressed in NP neurons in the developing neocortex, and, importantly,
that it plays a key role in the proper migration and consequent positioning of newborn NP neurons in vivo. Notably,
mutations in OPHN1 cause a syndromic form of intellectual disability. Besides learning disabilities, affected
individuals typically exhibit epileptic seizures and behavioral/sensory deficits. These findings provide a unique
entry point for studying the mechanisms that control NP neuron migration and how such deregulation contributes
to common brain disorders. This application aims to define the underlying mechanisms by which OPHN1 governs
NP neuron migration, to elucidate how OPHN1 is regulated in such neurons, and to characterize how its loss
during embryonic development affects the cytoarchitecture/function of the postnatal/adult mouse neocortex and
the behavior of such animals. To this end, Aim 1 will define and characterize the cellular processes and effector
pathways OPHN1 impinges on. Our preliminary data suggest that OPHN1 exerts its effects via RhoA-dependent
and RhoA-independent pathways, each influencing distinct cellular aspects of NP neuron migration. Therefore,
we will delineate the RhoA effector pathway(s) involved and identify novel molecular interactions that mediate
OPHN1’s effects on NP neuron migration, using innovative genetic, molecular and cellular tools. Aim 2 will
investigate the mechanisms that regulate OPHN1 function in NP neurons, with a particular focus on the BDNF
receptor tyrosine kinase TrkB, which we posit to act as key regulator of OPHN1 in NP neuron migration by
phosphorylating and consequently activating the protein. To test this, we will employ molecular/cellular tools and
genetic strategies to illuminate the mode of OPHN1 regulation by BDNF/TrkB signaling and address its functional
importance for NP neuron migration. Aim 3 will apply morphometric and electrophysiological techniques to
examine the morphology of NP neurons and neuronal/network activity in neocortices of juvenile/adult NEX-
Ophn1cKO mice lacking OPHN1 in postmitotic NP neurons. Furthermore, we will examine the behavior of NEX-
Ophn1cKO mice, with a particular focus on sensory-based and social/behavioral responses in addition to seizure
susceptibility. Together, our studies will provide novel insight into the mechanisms governing NP neuron
migration and shed light on the pathomechanisms contributing to NDDs of cognition and epilepsy.

There are pronounced sex differences in the incidence and etiology of mental health conditions. However, the
developmental mechanisms that give rise to sex differences in disease susceptibility or resilience remain
largely unknown. In this application we will explore the developmental origins of brain sex differences. In many
vertebrates, including mice, sex-specific neural circuitry develops under the control of estrogen signaling during
the first few days of life. Treating neonatal females with estrogen irreversibly masculinizes adult social
behavior, neural circuitry, and gene expression. To understand the actions of estrogen on the brain, we
recently identified the genomic targets of estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) and revealed that these genes are
differentially invoked in the developing and adult brain of both sexes. The goal of this proposal is to determine
the molecular and circuit consequences of early life ERα actions, with the long-term intent of connecting
individual ERα target genes to discrete sex-variable phenotypes. The posterior division of the bed nucleus of
the stria terminalis (BNSTp) is a key node in neural circuits that mediate social behaviors and is larger in males
compared to females. We hypothesize that BNSTp sexual dimorphism is specified by parallel epigenetic
events during a perinatal critical period: initiation of a persistent male-biased gene expression signature and
establishment of sex-specific neuronal connectivity. In Aim 1 we will determine the transcriptional mechanisms
that define sex differential gene regulation strategies: persistent early life gene expression in males, and
fluctuations in response to estrous hormones in adult females. In Aim 2 we will map the connectivity of the two
male-biased cell types we previously identified in the BNSTp, in both adults and across postnatal development.
In Aim 3 we will test the causality of perinatal ERα target genes and loci in specifying BNSTp sex differences.
Taken together, our findings will reveal how gonadal hormone signaling during early life permanently
influences adult gene expression, neuronal connectivity, and ultimately, sex-variable behaviors. This work will
provide insight into how a transient event during a critical developmental period can have significant impact on
the brain and behavior in adulthood. This critical period permanently affects brain structures and function,
suggesting that sex differences in psychiatric disorders, such as autism and depression, may originate during
sexual differentiation of the brain.

Project Summary
 The basal ganglia, in particular the dorsal striatum, play essential roles in motor control, motivational regulation
and reinforcement learning. On the other hand, striatal dysfunctions have been implicated in a number of
neurological and psychiatric disorders, including Parkinson's disease, Huntington’s disease, obsessive
compulsive disorder, autism, depression and drug addiction. A notable feature of the dorsal striatum is its
separation into two neurochemically distinct compartments, the striosome (or “patch”) compartment and the
surrounding matrix compartment. It is thought that neurons in the matrix and those in the striosome have distinct
functions, with the former critical for motor functions, whereas the latter important for evaluation functions during
learning and for regulation of motivation. In addition, the striosome compartment has been especially implicated
in the non-motor aspects of the neurological disorders, such as learning deficits, and mood and motivational
aberrations. However, despite intensive study, to date the functionality of neurons in the striosome remains
largely uncharacterized. Consequently, how striosome neurons contribute to reinforcement learning and
regulation of motivation is unclear. Whether and how dysfunctions in these neurons occur and contribute to the
diseases are also unknown.
 A major challenge to studying the striosome lies in the fact that it is labyrinthine in shape and has no clear
anatomical boundaries, making it difficult to precisely target for in vivo recording or manipulation. To address this
issue, we recently exploited mouse genetics for targeting neurons in the striosome. This strategy laid the
foundation for selectively monitoring and manipulating the activities of different populations of striosome neurons.
In the proposed study, we will capitalize on our approach and findings to investigate the behavioral roles of
distinct striosome populations in health and disease, and to uncover the underlying circuit and cellular
mechanisms. Our central hypothesis is that functionally distinct striosome populations differentially control
reward seeking and punishment avoidance through different circuit mechanisms. We further hypothesize that
these striosome neurons become dysfunctional after major stressful life events, thereby causing maladaptive
behaviors. We will test our hypotheses in the following Aims:
 Aim 1. To determine the behavioral roles of distinct classes of striosome neurons.
 Aim 2. To determine the circuit and cellular mechanisms underlying striosome functions.
 Aim 3. To elucidate the striosome dysfunctions underlying stress-induced maladaptive behaviors.

Project Summary
The central amygdala (CeA) contains heterogeneous cell types, with somatostatin-expressing (SOM+) neurons
and protein kinase C--expressing (PKC-+) neurons being two largest and largely non-overlapping
populations. Previous studies have mainly focused on the roles of these neurons in fear conditioning, revealing
that SOM+ and PKC-+ CeA neurons differentially contribute to fear learning and expression. However, it is
long recognized that the CeA contributes not only to behaviors driven by aversive stimuli, but also to those
driven by appetitive stimuli, and to the generation of anxiety state. Indeed, recent studies show that distinct
types of CeA neurons, such as SOM+ neurons, can drive appetitive behaviors and heightened anxiety.
However, how the SOM+ as well as PKC-+ CeA neurons participate in divergent motivational behaviors
remains poorly understood. Bridging this knowledge gap will have important clinical implications for improved
treatments, as CeA dysfunctions have been implicated in mood- or motivation-related disorders, including
anxiety disorders, depression and drug addiction.
We will address this question by investigating the in vivo response properties of SOM+ neurons and PKC-+
neurons in the CeA during behaviors driven by either reward or punishment, and determining how these
responses are used to control the functions of downstream circuits and, hence, behavior. Our central
hypothesis is that CeA neurons influence learning or expression of reward seeking and punishment avoidance
through their long-range projections to different targets. Based on our preliminary results, we devised an
integrated approach, combining in vivo imaging, fiber photometry, optogenetics, chemogenetics and novel
behavioral techniques, to test our hypotheses in the following Specific Aims:
 Aim 1. To determine the roles of SOM+ CeA neurons in motivational behaviors.
 Aim 2. To determine the roles of PKC-+ CeA neurons in motivational behaviors.
 Aim 3. To determine how a CeA-BNST circuit contributes to anxiety-related behaviors.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Mitochondrial glutaminases (GLS and GLS2) catalyze the hydrolysis of glutamine to glutamate and ammonium,
a metabolic reaction that is critical for numerous aspects of mammalian physiology. Whereas GLS2 expression
is largely restricted to the liver, GLS is ubiquitously expressed, with particularly high levels in the kidney, digestive
tract, and brain. Its roles include the regulation of systemic acid-base homeostasis and the biosynthesis of
excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters. Accordingly, human inborn errors of metabolism involving mutation
of the GLS gene have severe phenotypes, including neural excitotoxicity and lethal neonatal encephalopathy. In
addition to its functions in organismal health, dysregulated GLS activity has been implicated in a spectrum of
human pathologies, ranging from neurodegeneration to cancer. Consequently, there have been intensive efforts
to develop selective allosteric inhibitors of GLS, one of which is now being evaluated in clinical trials for the
treatment of solid and hematological malignancies. However, results to date indicate that the rapid development
of resistance limits the efficacy of this therapeutic strategy. Remarkably, despite the long history of GLS research,
it is not understood how the activity of this enzyme is regulated in cells. Purified recombinant GLS has minimal
catalytic activity, and vastly supraphysiological concentrations of inorganic phosphate (100-150 mM) are required
to activate GLS in vitro. We have recently discovered that that the bioactive phospholipid phosphatidic acid (PA)
is an extremely potent activator of GLS, approximately 107-fold more potent than inorganic phosphate.
Importantly, we have found that PA can activate GLS even in the presence of clinical GLS inhibitors, thus
rendering these drugs ineffective. In this project, we propose to define the molecular mechanism by which PA
activates GLS, and then to probe the upstream regulation of mitochondrial PA signaling, with the ultimate goal
of perturbing this process to overcome resistance to GLS inhibitors. In the course of these studies, we will
develop new chemical probes for investigating the PA-GLS interaction, including phosphorus-based covalent
capture probes to determine the binding site of the PA phosphomonoester head group. We will then conduct a
screen to identify additional potential metabolite-GLS interactions, and functionally validate any ‘hits’ obtained.
In the second Aim, we will build on preliminary data that strongly implicate the PA-generating enzyme
phospholipase D2 (PLD2), as well as the uncharacterized protein PLD5, in the regulation of the mitochondrial
PA-GLS axis. We will attempt to determine the function of PLD5, focusing on whether its reported interaction
with PLD2 regulates either the activity or subcellular localization of the latter. Finally, since our preliminary data
indicate that PLD2/5 mediate resistance to clinical GLS inhibitors, we will test whether pharmacological or genetic
blockade of PLD2 or PLD5 can overcome this resistance mechanism. Thus, our proposed studies will define the
physiological processes that regulate GLS activity, and will then apply this knowledge to identify opportunities
for enhancing the efficacy of therapeutic strategies targeting glutamine metabolism.

The central goal of this project is to understand fundamental mechanisms of human pre-mRNA
splicing, a required step in the expression of most eukaryotic genes, as well as the regulation of
alternative splicing. Specific mechanisms through which exons and introns are correctly identified
by the spliceosome will continue to be investigated. These studies will focus on recognition of the
canonical and non-canonical splice sites by snRNAs and RNA-binding proteins, and on contextual
effects due to other pre-mRNA features, such as splicing enhancer elements recognized by SR
proteins. The mechanisms of action and specificity of antisense-oligonucleotide and small-
molecule splicing modulators will be explored, as will the interplay between alternative splicing
and chromatin. In addition, the network of protein-protein interactions of the SR protein SRSF1
will continued to be investigated, with the goal of obtaining structural insights about its various
functions in splicing. This project will rely on integrative approaches, including molecular,
bioinformatics, biochemical, biophysical, proteomics, cell biology, and pharmacological
techniques, as well as in vitro, cell-based, and in vivo assays. In addition to obtaining new insights
into basic mechanisms of gene expression, these studies will improve the understanding of
numerous mutations associated with various genetic diseases, as well as facilitate correct genetic
diagnosis and therapeutics development for such diseases.

Every year, breast cancer kills more than a half-million women worldwide. Monumental efforts have made an
impact toward understanding primary disease and the development of targeted therapies. Yet, these therapies
still fail many women initially, and others relapse with therapy-resistant disease. Thus, we must focus on
developing better tools to predict disease susceptibility in those at higher risk, while augmenting the search for
molecularly based strategies to prevent breast cancer.
More specifically, mutations in the BRCA1 genes, and their consequent loss of function, are the most clinically
relevant genomic alterations that increase the susceptibility of individuals to breast cancer. Still, not all women
with BRCA1 mutations will develop breast cancer. Thus, we need a clear picture of the mechanisms that
govern cancer susceptibility. Our main goal is to define how the epigenome alters the development of
Brca-1 deficient mammary tumors.
We previously demonstrated that the mammary epithelium epigenome and specific chromatin remodeling
factors play a role in oncogenesis progression. Now, we hypothesize that the epigenome similarly contributes
to the development of BRCA1 mutant breast tumors. We will use innovative models of mammary oncogenesis
to specifically dissect epigenetic mechanisms that influence the development of Brca1-deficient mammary
tumors.
By investigating the effects of a specific epigenetic regulator (BPTF) and a global epigenomic program
(pregnancy) on mammary tumor progression, we may also identify prognostic biomarkers that will enable us to
identify women who will benefit from therapy. Ultimately, we hope to validate our hypotheses pre-clinically
using normal and malignant human breast organoid cultures, to aid the development of strategies that will be
useful as primary prevention in humans.

PROJECT SUMMARY
The overall goal of this Program is to understand how transcription and splicing regulation is altered and co-
opted by cancer cells to promote tumor initiation and progression, and to apply this knowledge towards
development of new therapeutic approaches. During the past 50 years, the strong underlying basic science
foundation of the Program Project has allowed members to identify vulnerabilities in cancer and develop novel
and highly specific therapeutic strategies. This Program continues to take a multi-pronged approach grounded
in basic cancer research to identify and disrupt the molecular dependencies underlying cancer.
Within this Program, there are three highly integrated Projects (Targeting oncogenic transcription factors; RNA
Splicing dysregulation in cancer; Regulatory RNAs as cancer drivers and dependencies) and four innovative
Cores that are using cutting edge technologies to study the molecular mechanisms of cancer biology. To achieve
the Program's goals, these studies will exploit novel organoid models of human cancers, pioneering imaging
modalities in animal models, therapeutic antisense oligonucleotide strategies against otherwise undruggable
targets, and cutting-edge methods in biochemistry, cell biology and molecular biology. The researchers will
interrogate the basis of two of the most devastating types of tumors, basal-like carcinomas of the breast and
pancreas. All of this work is supported by four Cores that provide access to technologies, services, and expertise
that all combine to enhance productivity and promote interactions.
The interactive and collaborative nature of this Program guides each of these Projects beyond their singular
potential. Research in all three Projects touches on overlapping themes and benefits from the expertise of the
other Program members. Together, this Program is making significant progress towards its goal of identifying
novel therapeutic targets that will substantially impact cancer treatment.

ABSTRACT
 The Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory conference on Genome Informatics will focus on the development
and utilization of large-scale genomic data and annotations. Genomic resources provide the fundamental
descriptions of an increasing array of organisms at the molecular level. This meeting forms part of a series that
alternates annually between Cold Spring Harbor, USA and Hinxton, UK. The goal of the series is to explore both
the latest provision of these resources, and perhaps most importantly, their use as engines of biological
discovery. This ranges from the storage of data and their associated data models, to the design of effective
algorithms to uncover non-obvious aspects of these datasets, to ontologies to concisely describe biological
information, and software systems to support curation, visualization, and exploration. The conference also covers
the use of genomics in combination with various imaging applications and the latest attempts to understand
microbial pathogenesis based on genomics. The conference has expanded its remit over the last few years, to
ensure it remains current with the latest applications of informatics, all the while ensuring a strong focus on
biological informatics. The conference brings together some of the leading scientists in this growing field, and
we strongly encourage researchers from other large scale information handling disciplines to attend.

Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a novel class of RNAs that hold immense potential as therapeutics due to
their unique cellular functions. However, the challenges associated with their synthesis and purification have
impeded their research and development. Chimerna proposes to develop a platform technology using yeast
to manufacture high-quality circRNAs for use in research, therapeutics, and diagnostics. The proposed
technology builds upon Chimerna's Tornado technology for expressing RNAs as a circle in cells. When
used in E. coli, the Tornado technology results in the production of RNA at high levels not previously seen
with conventional linear RNAs. The stability of circular RNA allows it to accumulate to high levels in E. coli,
and also confers high stability in vitro and when transfected into mammalian cells, thus mitigating the
persistent degradation problem of conventional linear RNAs. The project also utilizes a proprietary affinity
tag that is encoded into the circRNA making downstream purification easier. This technology resolves key
problems associated with current circular RNA synthesis methods that use in vitro transcription for
production. However, production of circRNA in E. coli results in high levels of LPS, which is difficult to
remove and not acceptable for therapeutic indications. The current proposal aims to engineer a yeast strain
capable of producing circRNAs at high yields. Unlike bacteria, yeast do not contain LPS, which is difficult to
remove in downstream purification applications. Moreover, yeast has been extensively used for
manufacturing many bioactive compounds such as proteins and lipids. This makes yeast an ideal organism
in which to develop a circRNA manufacturing platform. The specific aims of the project are: (1) - To
engineer a yeast strain that can be induced to express circular RNA at high yields: This aim involves
engineering multiple yeast strains to produce circRNAs and testing their yield under various inducible
promoters. The yeast strain will be further optimized by introducing RNA processing enzymes required for
maximum circularization efficiency; (2) To benchmark circRNA manufacturing to existing manufacturing
technologies: The second aim of the project involves comparing the yield and cost per gram of RNA
produced in yeast versus traditional IVT. The researchers will also examine protein expression and RNA
half-life from a circular mRNA versus a linear mRNA for total protein output in mammalian cells. Finally, they
will measure inflammatory responses to transfected circRNAs versus linear mRNAs. Taken together, the
development of a yeast manufacturing platform for synthesizing circRNAs holds immense promise for the
production of this highly important type of RNA. The proposed technology will greatly reduce the cost of
producing circRNAs while also simplifying the purification and downstream processing. This new
manufacturing platform will accelerate the entry of circRNAs for medical use, thereby advancing the field of
RNA therapeutics.

 Providing molecular fingerprint vibration information and high imaging speed, coherent Raman scattering
microscopy, based on either coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) or stimulated Raman scattering
(SRS), allows real-time vibrational imaging of living cells and/or tissues with sub-micron spatial resolution These
instrumentation-based advances, however, do not fulfill all the desired parameters in hyperspectral imaging,
including broad bandwidth, high signal to noise ratio (SNR) and high speed. In pushing these physical limits, it
is common that one parameter is optimized at the price of sacrificing other advantages. The current proposal
aims to break this conventional thinking of "no free lunch in optimization" through a synergistic integration of
advanced instrumentation and data science. A multidisciplinary team with a strong track record of collaborations
will pursue the proposed studies. Ji-Xin Cheng (PI) is a leading expert in the development and applications of
SRS chemical imaging. Lei Tian (co-I) is a leading expert in computational microscopy and machine learning.
Daniela Matei (co-I) is a leading expert in cancer research specialized in ovarian cancer. We aim to develop two
complementary platforms that will allow high-speed, high-content, and high-sensitivity mapping of cell
metabolism. The first platform is for samples without prior knowledge. We will build a polygon scanner to tune
the delay between two chirped pulses on a 20-microsecond time scale. We will then deploy deep spatial-spectral
learning to denoise the low-SNR hyperspectral measurements and extract salient information with much
enhanced SNR. This integrated approach effectively bypasses the conventional tradeoff between acquisition
speed and SNR and enables high-speed, high-throughput, hyperspectral SRS imaging using informative
fingerprint Raman bands. The second platform is for samples with known target species. We will develop a
sparsely sampled hyperspectral imaging strategy to increase the overall speed by one order of magnitude while
maintaining the same SNR. We will develop a novel "recursive feature elimination" approach to determine the
minimum number of essential frames. On the instrumentation side, a fast-tuning fiber laser will be deployed to
acquire a sparsely sampled hyperspectral stack within one second for the study of living systems. As a focused
application, we will apply the proposed platforms to systematically investigate metabolic reprogramming in
ovarian cancers that are cisplatin resistant. Our focused application will unveil hidden signatures that are
associated with drug resistance, which will open new opportunities for improved treatment of drug-resistant
cancers.

Major challenges facing nephrology today are declining interest in the field and lack of innovation and novel
drug and device development. These factors may be related. Students who perceive nephrology as stagnant
may be attracted to other specialties, thereby robbing the nephrology workforce of talented students who could
innovate and advance the field. The R25 Funding Opportunity Announcement by NIDDK to spark interest in
nephrology is therefore timely and an exciting opportunity to address a major need in the evolution of
nephrology and the care of patients with kidney diseases. We propose the development of the Boston
University Kidney and Medical Engineering Program (BU-KIDMEP). Our ultimate goal is to inspire talented
young scholars to improve the lives of individuals with kidney disease through innovative technology solutions.
To accomplish this, we have designed a program that: 1) Identifies students interested in technology and
engineering across Boston University, with an emphasis on undergraduates; 2) Pairs students with a
mentoring team comprised of a research/technology expert and a nephrology expert; 3) Fosters a 6- to 24-
month long education program that includes didactic training, clinical immersion, and technology development;
4) Showcases research at capstone symposia; and 5) Tracks metrics to improve the program's success in
attracting students to technology and kidney disease.

This proposal focuses on the fundamental question of how neuronal growth cones are guided to their targets. It
has long been established that growth cone navigation depends on regulated changes in both F-actin and
microtubule (MT) dynamics in response to guidance cues. However, the mechanisms by which these cues
bring about specific changes in growth cone MT dynamics are unresolved. This proposal takes aim at that
void, by investigating the function of the MT polymerase and ‘plus-end tracking protein’ (+TIP), XMAP215,
along with its regulatory mechanisms. Our recently published data identified an ability for XMAP215 to bind
directly to F-actin and promote MT extension into the growth cone. This is complemented by unpublished data
that kinase signaling modulates the ability of XMAP215 to promote MT-F-actin interaction. Our data support a
model in which XMAP215 mediates MT-F-actin coupling through structural domains distinct from those
regulating MT polymerization, and that XMAP215 converts signals from upstream guidance cues into changes
in cytoskeletal coordination, ultimately directing growth cone motility. We will test this in Xenopus laevis using
an array of complementary cell-based and biochemical approaches. The specific aims are: Aim 1 – Identify the
mechanism by which XMAP215 interacts with F-actin in vitro. We will determine the specific domain of
XMAP215 that binds to F-actin as well as identify how the binding is regulated. We will produce a variety of
deletion and phosphomutant XMAP215 proteins, and we will use a series of biochemical techniques including
F-actin/MT co-sedimentation binding assays, multi-wavelength TIRF microscopy with in vitro cytoskeletal
reconstitution assays, mass spectrometry, as well as EM experiments, to dissect the mechanism by which
XMAP215 binds to F-actin in vitro. Aim 2 - Determine how regulation of XMAP215 interaction with F-actin
modulates cytoskeletal dynamics and growth cone behaviors in cultured neurons. We will use structured
illumination microscopy (SIM), spinning disk confocal microscopy, and quantitative imaging analysis of +TIP
dynamics in cultured neurons, after expressing various XMAP215 mutants, to uncover new mechanistic
insights into how XMAP215 regulates MT-F-actin interactions in growth cones during axon outgrowth. Aim 3 -
Define how XMAP215 interaction with F-actin contributes to accurate axon guidance. We have discovered that
normal XMAP215 levels are required for cultured growth cones to be repelled from the axon guidance cue,
Slit2. We will use a combination of ex vivo and in vivo axon guidance assays to determine how growth cone
steering is impacted by the ability of XMAP215 to facilitate MT-F-actin interactions. The results of these Aims
will reveal the direct links between guidance cue signaling, kinase regulation of the only well-characterized MT
polymerase (XMAP215), and cytoskeletal coordination, within the context of growth cone steering. As such,
this proposed work has the potential to bring a long-needed mechanistic understanding to the question of how
extracellular cues govern cytoskeletal dynamics to effectively steer growth cones during neurodevelopment.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Increased glomerular filtration rate (GFR), also known as glomerular hyperfiltration, is a common observation in
the early stage of diabetes and is considered a key risk factor for the later development of diabetic kidney disease
(DKD). Although the pathophysiological mechanisms of glomerular hyperfiltration in diabetes have not been fully
understood, the tubuloglomerular feedback (TGF) has been implicated. In particular, the “tubular hypothesis” is
now widely recognized. It describes that proximal tubular reabsorption of sodium and glucose via the sodium-
glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) is upregulated in the diabetic kidney, thereby reducing the NaCl delivery to the
macula densa, which decreases the TGF activity and increases the single-nephron GFR in an effort to normalize
NaCl excretion (SGLT2-NaCl-TGF pathway). We have recently identified a new and complementing mechanism
that increases GFR in the diabetic kidney: the increased tubular glucose load at the macula densa is sensed
through the apical sodium-glucose cotransporter 1 (SGLT1) and enhances the neuronal nitric oxide synthase
(NOS1)-derived nitric oxide (NO) generation, which blunts TGF responsiveness and likewise increases the
single-nephron GFR (SGLT1-NOS1-TGF pathway). SGLT2 inhibition is currently changing the perspectives of
antidiabetic therapy with significant renoprotective effects. The benefits of SGLT2 inhibition in the diabetic kidney
have been proposed to be largely independent of its blood glucose-lowering effect and mainly based on the
central role of this transporter in the “tubular hypothesis” of diabetic glomerular hyperfiltration and nephropathy.
In accordance with the “tubular hypothesis”, inhibition of SGLT2 increases the macula densa NaCl delivery and
reduces diabetic hyperfiltration and thereby protects the diabetic kidney. However, inhibition of SGLT2 also
increases glucose delivery to the macula densa, which is expected to decrease the TGF responsiveness through
the macula densa SGLT1-NOS1-TGF pathway, and thereby limit both the GFR-lowering effect of SGLT2
inhibition and its protective effects on kidney. Therefore, in the present proposal, we will examine the effects of
SGLT2 inhibition on the tubular glucose load at the macula densa, the macula densa NOS1/NO levels, and TGF
responsiveness in diabetic mice, and then determine the significance of the macula densa SGLT1-NOS1
pathway in the SGLT2 inhibition-induced alterations in TGF and GFR by using mouse models with SGLT1
knockout or macula densa-specific NOS1 knockout; moreover, we will compare the effects of dual
SGLT1/SGLT2 inhibition and selective SGLT2 inhibition on TGF activity, GFR and kidney injury in diabetic mice,
and further determine the significance of the TGF mechanism in these effects by using a mouse model that lacks
TGF due to macula densa-specific NKCC2 knockout. Successful completion of this proposal will establish the
opposing role of the macula densa SGLT1-NOS1-TGF pathway in the protective effects of SGLT2 inhibition on
diabetic glomerular hyperfiltration and kidney injury, and thus provide supportive and mechanistic evidence for
the use of dual SGLT1/SGLT2 inhibition in the treatment of DKD.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
Individuals with serious mental illness (SMI) are three times more likely to die prematurely than the general
population. Sixty percent of this premature death is attributable to inadequate care of chronic, co-morbid
medical conditions. A growing proportion of patients with SMI receive care in accountable care organizations
(ACOs) – health care delivery and finance systems, in which global payments and quality benchmarks are
used to incentivize quality care and lower spending. An increasing number of states are implementing ACO
models in their Medicaid programs, the primary source of health insurance for low-income Americans with SMI.
Medicaid ACOs exist in 12 states, caring for over 6% of the Medicaid population. Medicaid ACOs have the
potential to both improve and worsen access to, and quality of, care for low-income adults with SMI. While
financial structures that incentivize care coordination and programs that address health-related social needs
likely benefit those with SMI, inadequate global payments that fail to account fully for social adversities such as
homelessness could result in lower quality care. Certain features of Medicaid ACOs, e.g. leadership structure
or ACO size, may amplify the benefits or drawbacks of the ACO model for patients with SMI. Evidence from
Medicare ACOs has shown that smaller, provider-led ACOs and those serving a lower proportion of socially-
vulnerable patients perform better in terms of quality. However, no evidence exists on how Medicaid ACO
characteristics affect quality of care or the care experience of SMI adults. Since Medicaid ACOs are rapidly
proliferating, filling this evidence gap is critical and can inform the evolution of the ACO model to better achieve
the goal of mental health parity. In this K23 research plan, we propose to identify features of Medicaid ACOs
(e.g. provider-led vs. hospital-led ACOs) that produce the highest quality ACO care for adults with SMI. We
will undertake this research objective in three critical domains. First, we will study whether certain ACO types
tend to drop patients with SMI, a practice known as favorable risk selection (or “cherry-picking”). This
phenomenon can cause instability of ACO enrollment for patients, itself a marker of lower quality care.
Second, we will compare care access and quality among adults receiving care in different ACO types. Lastly,
we will use mixed methods to examine the care experiences of adults with SMI receiving care in different ACO
types, through in-depth interviews and subsequent integration of qualitative and quantitative findings. For the
first two aims, we will use Massachusetts All-Payer Claims Data and leverage the state’s unique auto-
assignment mechanism as a natural experiment to study favorable risk selection, access, and quality. Auto-
assignment refers to Medicaid randomly assigning individuals to ACOs, allowing us to compare outcomes
across ACO types without selection bias caused by patients self-selecting their ACO affiliation. The goal of my
K23 research is to guide policymakers and hospital administrators in shaping the Medicaid ACO model to
produce more stable, higher-quality ACO care for patients with SMI.

Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) that are clinically and pathologically similar display significant differences in
disease progression, therapeutic response, and overall survival. The limited accuracy of current prognostic
biomarkers is a major unmet clinical need, particularly in a tumor type rapidly rising in prevalence and incidence.
While genetic drivers have been identified, these genetic alterations are limited to cancer cells and do not provide
a systematic assessment of information encoded within the intact tumor microenvironment (TME), including the
role of the tumor architecture and the spatially organized immunological processes. For example, while emerging
evidence proposes a key role for tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in orchestrating an
immunosuppressive TME, patient-specific factors that mediate cell-to-cell interactions and localized chemokine
and cytokine signaling in NETs are currently unknown. To address this knowledge gap, work from our group on
single-cell transcriptomic profiling of NETs has established that TAMs display an adverse continuum of cell states
(i.e. not separated into the historical M1 or M2 groupings), while expressing tumor-specific chemokines and
cytokines involved in regulating key immune pathways. Our findings highlight the significant heterogeneity within
the myeloid compartments of NETs, particularly TAMs, and may offer potential promising targets for prognosis
and therapy. However, unlocking this potential requires the systematic understanding of the spatial distributions
and interactions of these different macrophage cell populations with both the cancer cell and lymphoid cell
populations, which together - as a multi-cellular system - dictate immunosuppression or activation. These
intricate spatial insights are still majorly lacking and obtaining them is only recently possible with the advent of
new spatial technologies. To understand the underlying processes that drive NET progression, as well as reveal
potential therapeutic vulnerabilities, we will test our hypothesis across two mutually reinforcing aims. In Aim 1,
we will identify the exact spatial composition, architecture and cellular crosstalk of the tumor and TME of archival
NETs and connect the obtained information with macrophage-centric signaling and processes. In Aim 2, we will
determine if systematic spatial distributions and interactions of the macrophage cell populations and NET-
specific chemokine profiles are associated with disease outcomes in NETs. The successful implementation of
the proposed studies could provide innovative and data-driven insights into complex macrophage biology and
concurrently establish high-dimensional profiling of the TME as clinical biomarkers, thereby transforming
prognostic stratification and clinical management for patients with NETs and potentially identifying novel
druggable targets within the tumor as a whole.

Children with severe respiratory and cardiopulmonary illness who need out-of-hospital (prehospital) emergency
care are vulnerable to error and preventable harm. Improving prehospital patient safety for children is a national
research priority. Video-consultation with pediatric experts on telemedicine platforms (expert teleconsultation) is
a promising intervention that has produced safer care for children in hospitals and narrowed gaps in access for
underserved communities. However, the potential safety benefits of expert teleconsultation remain largely
untapped by Emergency Medical Service (EMS) systems. Studies demonstrating efficacy of pediatric
applications are urgently needed to improve EMS technology adoption. This R03 application builds on skills,
experience, and pilot data from Dr. Boyle’s K23 award to compete for a future R01 award to support her transition
to research independence as a clinician scientist conducting prehospital trials. To prepare for a future efficacy
trial, Dr. Boyle worked with EMS providers to design a low-cost mobile platform for use in ambulances and adapt
a simulation model to assess the technical performance of prehospital teams in high-risk pediatric transports and
measure the effects of interventions on patient safety outcomes. She conducted a pilot simulation-based
randomized controlled trial (RCT) to test intervention acceptability, feasibility and estimate statistical parameters
for the future R01 efficacy trial. This work identified two gaps that must be addressed before progressing to the
larger trial. First, the primary assessment tool lacked accuracy as it measured harm indirectly via performance,
so needed further adaptation. Second, teleconsultants had relevant expertise but used unstructured
communication which lessened intervention fidelity. This R03 application leverages existing K23 pilot RCT video-
recordings and qualitative data to (1) adapt and validate the simulation performance checklist to measure serious
safety events, a clinically important patient centered outcome, and (2) refine intervention training to standardize
communication processes in prehospital teleconsultation encounters. In Aim 1, the study team will use a modified
Delphi process with expert consensus to develop a safety event checklist and apply it to K23 video-recordings
to gather validity evidence to support its use in the future trial. In Aim 2, the team will test the feasibility of using
a tool to measure intervention fidelity and combine this with qualitative K23 stakeholder feedback to refine the
intervention training protocol to standardize communication processes. This R03 will produce the necessary
measurement tools and standardized intervention training to compete for a future R01 award that tests the
efficacy of teleconsultation to reduce harm in children who require prehospital emergency care, a national
research priority.

Hypoxic-ischemic brain injury in cardiac arrest survivors ranges in severity from mild cognitive impairment to per-
sistent vegetative state. Precise estimation of neurologic outcome (neuroprognostication) in this setting is crucial
to guide families and physicians in goals-of-care decisions and to improve allocation of critical care resources.
Outcome prediction tools include neurologic examination, neuroimaging, biochemical markers, and electrophysi-
ologic studies. Accurate neuroprognostication remains challenging, as previous studies assessing the prognostic
accuracy of these tools have been affected by withdrawal of life support due to perceived poor neurologic prog-
nosis (WLS-N), and thus subject to self-fulfilling prophecy bias. This bias, along with early pessimistic prognosti-
cation, most often leads to premature death of those dependent on life support, including some with potential for
good neurologic recovery. Consequently, the natural history of hypoxic-ischemic brain injury unbiased by the
effect of WLS-N has not been adequately investigated. In Brazil, the severity of hypoxic-ischemic brain injury is
assessed by prognostic tools similar to those used in the US; however, life-sustaining therapies are maintained
for prolonged periods due to cultural norms. This difference in practice, unbiased by WLS-N, allows for a unique
opportunity to observe the natural history of hypoxic-ischemic brain injury, and to identify true predictors of poor
outcome. The elucidation of the impact of WLS-N on the performance of neuroprognostic tools is a vital step
toward more accurate outcome prediction. This will be the first study to combine the advanced expertise from
leading international sites analyzing neuroimaging and electrophysiologic data applied to a population unbiased
by WLS-N, and to unveil the impact of self-fulfilling prophecy bias on the natural history of hypoxic-ischemic brain
injury and on the prediction performance of guideline-recommended neuroprognostic tools. We will prospectively
collect data on demographics, premorbid characteristics, details of cardiac arrest and resuscitation, post-cardiac
arrest care, detailed neurological examination findings, electrophysiologic studies and neuroimaging at standard-
ized time points, and assess functional outcomes at discharge and at 3, 6 and 12 months. Our goals are to: 1)
Determine the independent effect of WLS-N on mortality and overall outcomes, and 2) Demonstrate the
prognostic accuracy of current guideline-recommended tools in an uncensored population. As an ex-
ploratory aim, we will also develop independent, blinded multimodal neuroprognostic models for the US
and Brazil cohorts, and compare their performance. By completing this innovative project, we will understand
the impact of WLS-N on the natural history of hypoxic-ischemic brain injury and better characterize the timing of
recovery after cardiac arrest. These data will influence future neuroprognostication studies and trials of neuro-
therapeutics, as well as optimize the use of critical care resources. This study is the stepping stone to strength-
ening data on neuroprognostication by improving their reliability, thereby ultimately easing undue patient and
family suffering from prognostic uncertainty, and directing medical resources most efficiently.

Juxtaglomerular (JG) cells are a cluster of specialized vascular smooth muscle (VSM) cells located in the wall of
each afferent arteriole (Af-Art) at the entrance to the glomerulus. On one hand, JG cells preserve most of the
characteristics of VSM cells, but on the other hand, they are distinguished from VSM cells by their unique
endocrine characteristics, specifically the synthesis and secretion of renin. Renin released from JG cells into the
circulation catalyzes the conversion of angiotensinogen to angiotensin I, the first and rate-limiting step of the
renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) cascade. Commensurate with the central role of RAAS in fluid
and electrolyte homeostasis, renin synthesis and secretion by JG cells is regulated by multiple inputs that
generally reflect the status of extracellular fluid volume. The most important among the control mechanisms of
renin release is a pressure-sensing mechanism, denominated as the intrarenal baroreceptor. It is believed that
JG cells can detect slight changes in perfusion pressure through the Af-Art and respond with precise amounts
of renin synthesized and secreted to the circulation in sync, therefore functioning as a mechano-sensitive
rheostat to maintain a steady-state level of Af-Art perfusion pressure and thus systemic blood pressure. However,
the nature of the intrarenal baroreceptor and in particular, the central questions about this pressure-sensing
mechanism: what the exact mechano-sensor is in JG cells and how it controls renin synthesis and secretion,
remain elusive. A novel technique, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), provides a new tool to further
understand the genetic and molecular basis of the intrarenal baroreceptor in JG cells. Our preliminary studies of
scRNA-seq analysis have revealed that a gene Sdc1 is not only highly and differentially expressed in JG cells
vs. VSM cells, but also positively correlated with Ren1 expression. Sdc1 encodes syndecan-1, a transmembrane
proteoglycan, which allows for the transfer of information about extracellular environment changes into the cell
that consequently affects intracellular activities. Thus, in this project, we aim to determine whether syndecan-1
is a key mechano-sensor of the intrarenal baroreceptor mechanism in JG cells that controls renin synthesis and
secretion, regulates the circulating RAAS, and thus contributes to the maintenance of fluid and electrolyte
homeostasis and blood pressure. Specifically, in Aim 1, we will determine the expression of syndecan-1 in the
kidney, especially in JG cells; moreover, we will examine the effects of different perfusion pressures on the renin
mRNA and protein expression levels in JG cells with the in vitro model of isolated/perfused juxtaglomerular
apparatus and in vivo model of aortic coarctation in wild-type (WT), global Sdc1 knockout (KO), and JG cell-
specific Sdc1KO mice. In Aim 2, we will examine the volume depletion (low perfusion pressure) or volume
expansion (high perfusion pressure)-induced changes in the renin expression levels in JG cells, circulating levels
of RAAS, renal vascular resistance, urinary sodium excretion, and blood pressure in WT, global Sdc1KO, and
JG cell-specific Sdc1KO mice.

Minoritized individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1D) have approximately 2% higher average A1c levels and twice
the rate of hospitalizations, complications, and mortality as their white counterparts. However, the efficacy trials
establishing the benefits of hybrid closed loop (HCL) pump therapy in T1D have been in more socially
advantaged and predominantly non-Hispanic white patients. Use of this transformative technology by individuals
with T1D from underserved communities remains very low. We plan to conduct a randomized effectiveness trial
- with broader eligibility criteria (including markedly elevated A1c) and longer (9 month) follow up than the pivotal
HCL efficacy trials - to evaluate the benefits, safety risks and treatment complications of HCL use in underserved
adults with T1D (Specific Aim 1). Primary outcome will be % time-in-range 70-180 mg/dL, and secondary
outcomes will include % time < 70 mg/dL, DKA events and body weight. The HCL arm in the trial will include
three HCL systems (BetaBionics iLet, Insulet OP 5, Tandem Control IQ) that vary in degree of automation and
user input required for operation. More automated systems could potentially better match the needs of
underserved individuals with competing life demands that limit diabetes self-care; however, the potential benefits
of automation are at the cost of less personal control of the system, including adjustments for work-shift changes
and activity. Specific Aim 2 incorporates the novel application of Ecological Momentary Assessment to examine
the lived experience with HCL (including benefits and burdens, the impact of life stressors impact on HCL use,
and how the match between HCL system functionality and the individual’s needs and expectations impacts on
user experience). In Specific Aim 3, in collaboration with a user-centered designer, we will apply the learnings
from the study to develop: 1) Improved HCL patient education and clinician support tools; and 2) Decision-aids
to guide patient selection of the HCL system that is most aligned with personal preferences and needs. These
optimized training materials and decision-aids will set the stage for the translation of our research findings into
increased adoption of HCL in underserved communities and improved shared decision-making by patients and
clinicians in the selection of HCL systems.

Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDPs) affect 10% of pregnancies in the United States and are associated with
future cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk, with significantly higher prevalence and worse outcomes among Black women
and women with low incomes. Timely identification and management of CVD risk factors (e.g., blood pressure control)
after HDPs leads to substantial and sustained improvements in cardiovascular health. Yet only 25-50% of patients receive
recommended care in the year after HDPs, with further inequities by race and income. Therefore, inadequate care after
HDPs is a critical missed opportunity to promote cardiovascular health and health equity among women. Unfortunately,
efforts to improve cardiovascular health after HDPs are limited by key gaps in evidence and approach. First, there is a
general need for more data on CVD risk and cardiovascular health in diverse populations. Second, such data must be
followed rigorous implementation of evidence-based interventions that address social and structural factors, with
stakeholder engagement. In response, Dr. Murray Horwitz has developed a plan to address large knowledge gaps, work
with diverse stakeholders to adapt an evidence-based intervention and prepare for its successful implementation, and
pilot-test the intervention, to improve cardiovascular health equity after HDPs. Her 3 specific aims are to: (1) Examine the
distribution of cardiovascular health (measured by Life’s Essential 8) in a diverse nationwide sample of patients with prior
HDPs (n~40,000), then identify key care gaps along the pathway from HDPs to cardiovascular health (e.g., access to
outpatient care, CVD risk assessment), and finally identify multi-level predictors of a key point of drop-off (e.g., access to
outpatient care). These findings will inform adaptations to a postpartum patient navigation intervention, to ensure that it
addresses priority populations and modifiable barriers to cardiovascular health after HDPs. (2) Conduct stakeholder-
engaged qualitative research in 2 health care settings, to contextualize care pathways in the year after HDPs, then identify
potential implementation barriers for the planned patient navigation intervention. Findings will be used to refine the
implementation strategy for the intervention, prior to pilot testing. (3) Conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial to test the
feasibility and acceptability of a postpartum patient navigation intervention, adapted to improve cardiovascular health after
HDPs, in a large safety net hospital (n=30/group, 60 total). Trial results will inform further improvements to the intervention
and implementation strategy, to be followed by multi-site effectiveness testing. Her research aims reflect the NHLBI’s
Strategic Vision, to, “Reduce health disparities and inequities […] by leveraging epidemiology […] to understand and solve
complex health problems.” They also serve as vehicles for her training goals, as follows: (1) Develop expertise in
advanced modeling techniques, specifically multi-level modeling and risk prediction; (2) Establish competency in learning
health system science, specifically in the areas of community engagement, equity & justice, improvement &
implementation science frameworks, and research methods; and (3) Gain skills in pragmatic clinical trial design &
conduct. This award will facilitate Dr. Murray Horwitz’s long-term goal of becoming an independent investigator who
develops and disseminates interventions that improve cardiovascular health and health equity among women.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Project Summary
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a progressive neurological condition affecting up to 1% of older adults, over 90% of
whom experience speech problems. These speech problems cause reductions in quality of life, as measured by
patient-centered outcomes (PCOs) of communicative participation, speech intelligibility, and naturalness, with
further declines as the disease progresses. Decrements in PCOs can be attributed to changes in underlying
physiological mechanisms of speech (i.e., the respiratory, laryngeal, and articulatory subsystems), yet the
relative contributions of changes in speech physiology to PCOs are unknown. Without this knowledge, precious
therapy time may be wasted on addressing physiological changes that do not matter to the patient experience.
Defining the relationships between speech physiology and PCOs would allow clinicians to focus on physiological
changes that are important to the patient. Furthermore, since many clinical settings do not have the resources
to implement physiological measures, research is needed to determine which clinically accessible acoustic
assessments are related to the individualized changes in speech physiology that drive changes in PCOs. We
propose a comprehensive, longitudinal study of PCOs, physiology, and acoustics in a large sample, which
should provide novel outcomes for clinical translation. In Aim 1, we will compare longitudinal changes in PCOs
in PD to concomitant changes in speech physiology. Regardless of whether we see group-level changes, this
aim will provide physiological targets that are tied to PCOs in the individuals who decline during the study period.
In Aim 2, we will develop and evaluate a refined set of acoustic correlates of speech decline in PD based on
their relationships with respiratory, laryngeal, and articulatory physiology. Finally, in Aim 3, we will
psychometrically assess the sensitivity to change of the measures of speech physiology and the acoustic
correlates. The ability of a measure to appropriately reflect change over time is a critical characteristic, essential
for measures to be used for clinical or research applications. To comprehensively assess sensitivity to change,
we will examine both decreasing (due to disease progression) and increasing (due to improvement with
behavioral cueing – clear speech) function. Our results will provide a roadmap for future evidence-based
treatment. Based on a physiological or acoustic evaluation, clinicians will be able to target specific speech
subsystems to improve PCOs. This work will guide the future development of personalized treatment for
individuals with PD.

Gender-diverse (GD) individuals are underserved, targets of violence, and at higher risk for negative health
outcomes. Although up to 66% of GD individuals are assigned female at birth (AFAB) and up to 97% of these
individuals have gender-related voice problems, there is no evidence-based treatment for voice
masculinization, a critical factor in gender-affirming medical intervention and personal safety. Most clinicians
and many patients are left to assume that gender-affirming hormone therapy with testosterone (T) is the only
path toward voice change. The current speculation is that T leads to an increase in the size of the vocal folds,
leading to lower fundamental frequency (fo), and thus to voice masculinization. However, this theory has not
been directly assessed, and T is likely to cause additional structural changes to the larynx and vocal tract that
may impact both self- and listener vocal-perception of gender (VPoG). In summary, despite a critical health
need in an at-risk population, there is a lack of evidence supporting this common voice treatment for GD-AFAB
individuals. The goal of this proposal is to evaluate our conceptual model of voice and speech in GD-AFAB
speakers: 1) that T results in anatomical changes in vocal fold length, vocal fold thickness, and vocal tract
length, decreasing voice fo and speech formants, which leads to changes in VPoG; and 2) that individual
characteristics are related to the degree of VPoG changes with T. This observational study will follow GD-
AFAB adults who are being treated with T as part of their normal clinical care to systemically test this model.
In Aim 1, we will longitudinally characterize the effects of T in GD-AFAB individuals, providing unprecedented
understanding of the actual impact of this common treatment at the group level. In addition to anatomical,
physiological, and acoustical measures, perceptions of both self and others will be included to account for
potential misalignment of these perceptions, which are equally important outcome measures of voice
modification [8, 99]. This aim will provide evidence-based expectations about voice masculinization for
individuals considering the use of T. Aims 2 and 3 will examine changes in VPoG at the individual level,
regardless of group-level findings in Aim 1. In Aim 2, we will define the anatomical, physiological, and
acoustical changes associated with changes in VPoG with T. This aim will identify how T modifies
communication, which will allow for objective outcomes and therapeutic targets in future clinical trials. Finally,
in Aim 3, we will determine participant characteristics that are associated with changes in VPoG with T,
providing more precise expectations about individual treatment responses.
Together, these aims will provide a roadmap for future evidence-based treatment: clinicians will be able to
provide guidance about when, how, and in whom communication will be impacted by T.

Communicating in environments containing multiple talkers (restaurants, parties, etc.) is the biggest challenge
faced by listeners with hearing loss. Previous work has shown that this difficulty stems from both monaural and
binaural deficits. Current hearing aids do not fully compensate for these deficits and thus do not offer adequate
improvements in multitalker environments. In some cases they even introduce additional distortions that may be
particularly detrimental in such situations. The goal of the proposed project is to leverage our understanding of
these different issues to explore ways of improving speech perception for hearing-aid wearers in multitalker
environments. Aim 1 will focus on restoring audibility, which is the primary goal of a hearing aid. Since
amplification strategies are mostly optimized for restoring speech audibility in quiet, they may not be optimized
for speech presented in multitalker mixtures. In particular, the speech of interest in multitalker mixtures may only
be available in rather sparse regions of time and frequency (or “glimpses”). The experiments proposed in Aim 1
will compare the ability of different amplification strategies to restore the audibility and intelligibility of glimpsed
speech. This work will demonstrate the impact that even small variations in audibility can have on real-world
speech understanding, and reveal potentially important differences between current amplification strategies. Aim
2 is motivated by the fact that some listeners with hearing loss also demonstrate reduced sensitivity to binaural
cues, which weakens the perception of location and may hinder selective attention. The experiments in this aim
will investigate speech enhancement strategies that are designed to enhance the representation of speech in
noise to improve intelligibility. Because they operate by altering the speech envelope, a secondary benefit may
be to increase the salience of binaural cues carried in the envelope. Enhancement will be applied to speech
stimuli across a range of spatial tasks, to identify conditions under which a binaural benefit is observed. This
work will open up a new avenue for improving the representation of complex acoustic scenes in hearing-aid
wearers. Finally, while appropriate amplification and binaural enhancement have the potential to improve speech
perception in multitalker mixtures, it is vitally important that hearing devices do not offset these benefits by
introducing distortions that have the opposite effect. Aim 3 will focus on one such distortion that has been
identified. While empirical data is limited, there are many indications that hearing aids increase the tendency for
external sounds to be perceived close to or inside the head. This disorienting effect may have particularly serious
consequences in multitalker mixtures, where distinct spatial locations are critical for segregating competing
voices. The experiments proposed in Aim 3 will systematically examine the effect of hearing aids on sound
externalization, clarify the source(s) of this effect, and determine the impact on speech intelligibility. This work
will highlight the critical importance of maintaining natural sound images in hearing aids for optimizing speech
intelligibility in real-world listening situations.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Summary
Antiretroviral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an important tool for preventing transmission to virus naïve
individuals and plays an important role in current efforts to end the HIV epidemic. If taken daily current oral PrEP
strategies reliably block HIV transmission. However, the requirement of strict adherence to daily pill uptake, pill
fatigue and other institutional barriers to access leave oral PrEP underutilized. Long-acting injectable PrEP
strategies have the potential to address many of the problems associated with oral PrEP but the realization of
drug formulations and delivery strategies that ensure sustained drug release for at least three months has
remained challenging and motivates the development of entirely new long-acting PrEP strategies. This project
develops a long-acting injectable PrEP strategy based on membrane-wrapped nanoparticles (NPs) that establish
cellular depots for sustained maintenance of inhibitory concentrations of antiretrovirals (ARVs) at primary tissue
sites of HIV-1 transmission in the female genital tract (FGT) and rectum. Selective targeting of CD169-expressing
macrophages and dendritic cells is accomplished through incorporation of the ganglioside GM3 in the NP
membrane. GM3-CD169 binding triggers uptake and sequestration of NPs in non-endolysosomal compartments
that share distinct similarities with virus containing compartments (VCCs) in tissue-associated macrophages and
dendritic cells. These compartments represent protected sites from where NPs can release drugs into the
surrounding tissue for an extended period of time. Membrane-wrapped inverse micelles of block copolymers will
be engineered as a GM3-NP platform for long-acting PrEP. A combination of long-acting tenofovir (TFV) and
emtricitabine (FTC) prodrugs will be used as active compounds to validate the approach. The block copolymer
NPs will contain TFV covalently linked to a polymer shell that encapsulates an aqueous core holding FTC
conjugated to dendrimers. After quantifying drug loading and release in vitro, the GM3-mediated targeting of
CD169+ myeloid cells in the FGT and rectum of a humanized mouse model will be tested. In parallel, the GM3-
NP platform will be optimized to achieve sustained drug release in the target tissues. The hypothesis that the
optimized NPs provide protection from mucosal HIV infection in a humanized mouse model for at least three
months will be tested. The specific aims of this application are:
Aim 1: To develop membrane-wrapped multicomponent NPs for sustained release of TFV/FTC.
Aim 2: To target CD169-expressing myeloid cells in the FGT and SLTs for sustained TFV/FTC release.
Aim 3: To demonstrate long-term protection from mucosal HIV-1 transmission in humanized mice by TFV/FTC
incorporating GM3-NPs.

Targeting the Genus Leishmania with Small Molecules
 Leishmaniasis is a neglected disease caused by protozoan parasites from the genus Leishmania sp. It
is transmitted by the sandfly vector and manifests in different clinical forms including skin ulcers, mucosa
destruction, damage to visceral organs such as the liver and spleen, and bone marrow damage. The clinical
outcome is determined primarily by the species of the parasite and the immune system of the host. There are
98 countries affected by leishmaniasis with more than 2 million people currently infected and 350 million people
at risk. The spread of leishmaniasis is of particular concern to US citizens in southern states such as Texas and
Oklahoma, where cases have recently been reported, as well as to US military troops stationed abroad in
geopolitically unstable regions where the disease tends to thrive.
 Chemotherapy options for leishmaniasis are limited. Antimonials have been the first line drug for decades
in most endemic countries, despite antimony’s notorious adverse effects, hospitalization requirements and
increasing cases of antimony-resistant parasites. Amphotericin B, the main alternative treatment, also causes
significant harmful side effects. Liposomal formulations are better tolerated, but are prohibitively expensive for
most affected populations. Miltefosine, an anti-cancer drug, was recently repurposed to treat leishmaniasis and
is the only oral treatment available and approved for use in the US. Miltefosine also has toxicity limitations,
teratogenicity and lack of efficacy against certain Leishmania species. The development of new chemotherapies
to treat the different clinical forms of leishmaniasis is in urgent demand, and is clearly an unmet medical need.
 To address this unmet medical need, Scott Schaus and Lauren Brown from Boston University (BU) will
lead a collaborative project with Jair Lage Siqueira-Neto at the UC San Diego Center for Discovery and
Innovation in Parasitic Diseases (CDIPD), Camila Indiani de Oliveira at FIOCRUZ and Mark Grinstaff at BU to
characterize the activity of antileishmanial small molecules and develop them as systemic and topical
therapeutics. Preliminary work by the team has led to the identification of a chemotype with nanomolar in vitro
efficacy against both visceral- and cutaneous-causative species of the parasite, a suitable pharmacokinetic
profile for in vivo studies, and demonstrated in vivo efficacy in a cutaneous leishmaniasis infection model.
 This grant outlines a proposal to further develop the chemotype and address specific challenges in
antileishmanial drug discovery, including drug target identification, options for dosing and administration, and
most importantly the applicability of the chemotype to treat multiple manifestations of the disease, including those
that are most relevant and endemic to the American continents. Our end goal is to develop at least one pre-
clinical candidate for the treatment of either visceral or cutaneous leishmaniasis.

Susceptibility to diverse immune diseases has been associated with genetic differences that affect
gene expression. Understanding the mechanisms by which these genetic differences lead to disease
has been a central goal of genomic efforts aimed at describing disease mechanisms and identifying
targets for therapeutic treatments. While large-scale studies have identified thousands of genetic
differences associated with immune diseases, in most cases, it is not known which variants are
causal and which are non-causal passenger variants. This is a considerable problem for the many
variants that exists in non-coding regions of the genome for which function is difficult to predict. Thus,
there is a critical need for the high-throughput experimental approaches to characterize the function
and mechanism of the many non-coding variants associated with immune diseases. To tackle this
challenge, we will use two complementary high-throughput approaches to study the impact of genetic
variants on immune gene expression. We will use MPRAs (Massively Parallel Reporter Assays) to
study the impact of genetic variants on gene expression. We will use our recently developed
CASCADE (Comprehensive Assessment of Complex Assembly at DNA Elements) approach, in
conjunction with mass spectrometry-based studies, to profile the impact of genetic variants on TF-
cofactor complex binding. We will use these approaches to characterize (1) the impact of genetic
variants on ~30 immune gene regulatory elements, and (2) ~5000 genetic variants found to be
associated with immune disease or altered gene expression. Combining these approaches will
address both function and biophysical mechanism of genetic variants in a cell- and stimulus-specific
manner. Furthermore, as many regulatory cofactors can be inhibited with drugs, characterizing TF-
cofactor complexes bound at genetic variants provides an opportunity to identify therapeutics to
counteract their effects. Altogether, by integrating complementary, high-throughput approaches that
directly account for effects of cell type and cell stimulation, the proposed studies will identify the
mechanisms by which non-coding variants affect gene expression and immune diseases.
Furthermore, these studies will lay a foundation for translating large-scale genetic studies into
therapeutic approaches to treat for immune diseases.

Alzheimer’s disease, the most common cause of dementia and the sixth most common cause of death, afflicts
nearly 6 million people in the United States. Alzheimer’s disease is a major economic burden to our society with
an annual cost of more than $250 billion. Cerebrovascular integrity is critical for proper metabolism and perfusion
of the brain. Compliance of large cerebral arteries is critical as these arteries dampen the pulsatile pressure and
protect the microcirculation and blood brain barrier from damage. Cerebrovascular dysfunction can have
detrimental impacts on the brain. Growing evidences suggest that cerebrovascular dysfunction plays a crucial
role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease and can potentially be used as a biomarker for preclinical
Alzheimer’s disease. The overall goal of this project is to unravel the close relationship between cerebrovascular
remodeling and the progression of Alzheimer’s disease.
 Our preliminary study suggested that with pathological progression of Alzheimer’s disease, the human
cerebral artery showed progressive stiffening, structural breakdown, and increases smooth muscle cell atrophy.
We thus hypothesize that the structural and functional changes in large cerebrovasculature is correlated with
neurodegeneration and the accumulation of Amyloid-β, other toxic metabolites, and tau pathology in the brain.
Building upon our multidisciplinary expertise in vascular mechanobiology, precision mass spectrometry,
advanced optical imaging, immunohistochemistry, vascular biology and neuropathology of Alzheimer’s disease,
we will test this hypothesis in three aims: Aim 1) to determine cerebrovascular remodeling (biomechanical,
structural, and compositional changes) in the frontal and temporal lobes in Alzheimer’s disease; Aim 2) to
determine the association between cerebrovascular remodeling and Alzheimer’s disease pathological changes
in the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain; and Aim 3) to examine the association between cerebrovascular
remodeling and antemortem cognitive status and neuropsychological test performance.
We will use no or low atherosclerotic cerebrovascular and brain tissue from 100 age- and sex-matched brain
donors from the NIA-funded BU Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center with 1) no Alzheimer’s disease pathology,
2) low Alzheimer’s disease pathology, and 3) intermediate/high Alzheimer’s disease pathology
. These
brain
donors have completed annual National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center Uniform Data Set evaluations during
life and have available consensus-based cognitive diagnoses. This proposal is designed to leverage existing
resources to make new discoveries. The matched and parallel studies of cerebral vessels and brain tissue will
provide new understandings of the temporal development of cerebrovascular remodeling and AD. Understanding
the role of vascular remodeling in Alzheimer’s disease may lead to the discovery of new treatment options and
directions for interventions to stave off Alzheimer’s disease.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Degeneration or breakdown of the myelin sheath that wraps and insulates axons of the central nervous system,
as well as peripheral nerves, is a factor in a large array of neurological disorders. These include multiple
sclerosis, stroke, age-related neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s, and in non-neurodegenerative age-
related cognitive impairment. To date, myelin breakdown has been assessed indirectly with neurophysiological
assays of conduction, post-mortem myelin staining, or in-vivo diffusion MRI. In the normal aging rhesus monkey,
post-mortem electron microscopy (EM) has confirmed myelin breakdown at the ultrastructural level; however,
EM studies cannot be scaled up to evaluate the entire 100-cc monkey brain or the larger human brain. Myelin
stains suffer from various technical and practical limitations that impede quantification. Other methods, like label-
free spectral confocal reflectance imaging (SCoRe), and coherent anti-Stokes Raman spectroscopy (CARS), are
promising, but like EM, are expensive, slow and difficult to apply to large brain sections. While SCoRe and CARS
microscopy work in reflectance, opening the possibility of in-vivo imaging through a cranial window in the small-
animal brain, a complementary method is needed that is validated, quantitative and high-resolution, to survey
the status of myelin in whole-brain sections of monkey or human brain. Here we propose to optimize and
validate quantitative birefringence microscopy (qBRM) for high-resolution imaging of normal and
abnormal myelin. The qBRM image provides, for every pixel, two quantitative measures: a) the relative phase
retardance, which is linearly proportional to the density of the birefringent medium and the organization of its
anisotropy; and b) the local orientation of the optic axis of the myelin, which corresponds to the direction of the
structural anisotropy. Archived brain tissues from two rhesus monkey models of myelin damage are available for
this project at the Boston University Medical Campus (BUMC). In Aim 1 we will automate the function of our
birefringence microscope with computer-controlled, motorized polarizer components and stage-positioning, to
facilitate fast, automated image acquisition (montaging) of large tissue sections (up to 40x40 mm). We will also
employ massively-parallel computing resources at BU to rapidly render the multi-megapixel quantitative images.
In Aim 2 we will validate our qBRM image measures by comparing them, in the same sections, with myelin
identified by myelin stains, such as FluoroMyelin Red, and with label-free spectral confocal reflectance (SCoRe)
microscopy. In Aim 3, We will demonstrate the untility of qBRM for quantifying myelin by imaging tissue sections
from three monkey models of myelin pathology: a) behaviorally characterized young and old monkeys with
cognitive assessment; b) behaviorally characterized old monkeys with impaired hand movement produced by
motor-cortex injury and treated with mesenchymal stem-cell derived extracellular vesicles (EVs); c) behaviorally
characterized old monkeys with demonstrated cognitive impairments treated with EVs. Together this will
establish the validity and utility of qBRM for assessing myelin in the central nervous system in health and disease.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Project Summary 
Anxiety disorders are highly prevalent, with diagnoses peaking during adolescence, creating a significant psychological and economic societal burden. Moreover, existing behavioral treatments to attenuate inappropriate fear responding in anxiety disorders have limited or no success for nearly half of the adolescent population. A critical barrier to developing treatments better suited for this group is a lack of knowledge about how key neural circuits related to fear acquisition and inhibition mature. The principal goal of this project is to identify the mechanisms underlying fear inhibition specifically as it manifests during adolescence. This project integrates adolescent behavioral models with cutting edge neural imaging and manipulation techniques to elucidate the yet unstudied mechanisms by which safety signals inhibit fear during adolescence. A ‘conditioned safety’ paradigm adapted for application during mouse adolescence is used to address key basic science questions about safety learning with far-reaching translational and clinical value. Through this paradigm, mice learn to utilize stimuli explicitly predicting the absence of an aversive outcome (i.e., ‘safety signals’) in service of attenuating fear responding. Research during the Mentored (K99) phase focused on the connection between the the ventral hippocampus (VH) and prelimbic cortex (PL), regions involved in the allocation and regulation of affective behaviors, and that undergo robust changes across adolescence. In-vivo calcium imaging (fiber photometry) was used to record and optogenetics to manipulate activity in VH-PL neurons in adolescent mice, elucidating a link between real-time dynamics of safety and fear behavior to fluctuations VH-PL signaling. Drawing from the literature and integrating preliminary data collected during the K99 phase led to the advancement of the central hypothesis that VH projections to PL interneurons promote safety behavior by producing a net inhibition of PL that is sustained throughout presentations of safety, but not fear signals, and that the heightened plasticity observed within VH and PL during adolescence provides a ‘sensitive window’ for enhanced efficacy of the conditioned inhibition of fear by safety signals. The goal of the Independent (R00) phase is to identify the PL interneuron targets of VH neurons and their relative activity during conditioned safety. Aim 1 will use a spectrally resolved fiber photometry system to record simultaneously from VH projections and select populations of PL interneurons. Aim 2 will use a Fos-activated (TRAP) viral-vector strategy to manipulate functional ensembles of PL interneurons to establish their contributions to the inhibition of fear. A foundation for accomplishing this research has been set through intensive training and discussion with an advisory panel of mentors, consultants, and collaborators with renowned expertise in adolescent development, fear learning, and circuit and cell-type specific neuronal modulation techniques. The candidate is well-positioned for an independent research career investigating behavioral regulation in developmental rodent models relevant to psychiatric illness and identifying circuit-level targets for intervention and treatment.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Summary
 More than 90% of all cancer-related deaths are caused by metastasis, the spread of cancer from its origin.
By the time most cancer metastases become clinically visible, the disease has progressed too far to benefit from
early-stage interventions such as surgery or radiation. Thus, new approaches accessing specific diagnostic
biomarkers are highly desired to improve therapeutic outcomes. Microenvironmental signatures such as
extracellular matrix (ECM) alterations, stromal composition, or immune components exhibit critical determinants
of metastatic dissemination broadly across cancers. Herein, the main goal of this proposal is to converge the
disease hall markers and rational design of biomolecular engineering to develop multidisciplinary approaches
towards precision diagnostics of cancer metastasis. As metastases start to invade, they alter the extracellular
matrix through aberrant proteolytic activities that could be leveraged as biomarkers. The applicant set out to
systematically identify proteases expressed in metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) by transcriptomic and
proteomic analysis. To improve the detection sensitivity, it is proposed to integrate the proteolytic activity to
formulate a library of enzyme activated sensors by reengineering the ECM targeting nanobody with
extraordinarily tumor targeting efficacy for maximal on-target signal generation (Aim 1). To optimize the detection
specificity, the multiplexity of these activity-based sensors will be extensively expanded for disease classification
using CRISPR-Cas-based nucleic acid barcode readout. Preliminary investigation into the in vivo DNA barcodes
revealed that they could be detected noninvasively as a urinary reporter, but could also enable portable detection
on paper (Aim 2). Beyond initial diagnosis, disease stratification and treatment monitoring are critical to
establishing a robust therapy. The novel sensors will thus be evaluated for noninvasive tumor monitoring and
imaging in disease recapitulating metastatic CRC models (Aim 3). Successful completion of these three aims
would offer a tumoral activation responsive, genetically encoded tracking (TARGET) platform can 1) unveil new
biology at the metastasis-specific tumor microenvironment, 2) provide a completely noninvasive way to track
tumor metastasis, and 3) offer a pipeline for validating novel therapies, which are currently unachievable by
single modality agents. This project requires innovative integration across several fields. The candidate has
assembled an exceptional team to help her achieve the goals of technology development and career transition,
including her mentor Dr. Sangeeta Bhatia (MIT, medical engineering) and Drs. Tyler Jacks (MIT, tumor genetics),
Dr. Richard Hynes (MIT, extracellular matrix), Dr. Frank Gertler (MIT, cell motility) and Dr. Shawn Chen (NIH,
theranostics) on the mentoring committee. This training period will allow the candidate to gain experience in
tumor microenvironment network, pre-clinical cancer models and analytical chemistry. In the future, the principles
of this modular platform could apply to other disease areas. The research program here aligns well with the
candidate’s long-term goal to develop multi-scale engineered tools in the context of cancer.

Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) have well-established risk factors such as physical activity (PA),
depression, and hypertension (HTN). These risk factors disproportionately affect racial minority populations, but the
mechanisms underlying racial health disparities are not well understood. In this, geographic factors could be key, as PA,
depression and HTN are strongly affected by geographic exposures, including green space. However, green space is
typically measured with questionnaires, which have substantial error, or satellite-based indexes that are nonspecific and
provide no information on the type of vegetation (e.g., tree vs. grass), nor whether the vegetation is within view at the street
level. As a result, no study has quantified the contribution of green space to racial disparities in ADRD. And while novel
technologies such as Google Street Views (GSV) imaging are promising data sources for capturing unique measures of
green space, managing, processing, and analyzing high-dimensional data present significant logistical and analytical
challenges, especially when linking these data to existing data from large prospective cohorts. Finally, we need to understand
green space in the context of other potentially correlated geographic exposures, or the urban exposome—the totality of life-
course geographic exposures (the set of green space, air pollutants, noise, built environment, and social environment)—to
estimate which factors drive health. This proposal will address these challenges by using GSV imaging to assess the effect
of green space on PA, depression, and HTN, as well as subsequent ADRD risk within the Multi-Ethnic Study of
Atherosclerosis (MESA)—a 10-year longitudinal study of 6,814 men and women without clinical cardiovascular disease at
baseline from 4 racial/ethnic groups (Non-Hispanic White, African-American, Chinese, and Hispanic). Aim 1 will quantify
the effect of specific aspects of green space (e.g. trees, grass, shrubs, plants) on ADRD and cognitive decline and evaluate
whether these associations differ according to race/ethnicity. Aim 2 will determine the indirect effect of green space on
ADRD that is mediated through PA, depression, and HTN. Aim 3 will quantify exposome associations with ADRD and
cognitive decline using untargeted data-driven approaches in conjunction with dimension reduction techniques and evaluate
whether they differ according to race/ethnicity. This research plan is complemented by a training plan that builds on the
applicant’s background in epidemiology and biostatistics and includes new training in (1) implementing deep learning
algorithms to analyze high-resolution geographic data, (2) cognitive function epidemiology, and (3) developing and refining
data-driven approaches to perform exposome-informed epidemiological studies. These combined plans will successfully
prepare the applicant for an independent research career focused on identifying modifiable geographic determinants of
ADRD in diverse populations using innovative measures of geographic context.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Bacterial glycoconjugates are a diverse group of macromolecules that play a key role in bacterial survival and
pathogenicity by mediating bacteria-host interactions. Despite their structural diversity, many glycoconjugates
are made by prokaryotes utilizing a common mechanism, which includes transferring glycans to a Pren-PP-
linked carrier at the membrane interface. The striking diversity of glycoconjugates is achieved through sequential
addition of glycans by glycosyltransferases (GTs), which transfer sugars from soluble nucleotide-activated
donors (NDP-sugars) to the lipid-based carrier molecule. Despite being ubiquitous across all kingdoms of life,
GTs still represent an excellent target for antibiotics, due to the remarkable degree of selectivity they exhibit for
structurally very similar sugars. Understanding the structural features that influence GT substrate selectivity and
protein-protein interactions in pathogenic bacteria like Campylobacter species is critical for antibiotic
development, and this research proposal strives to address that knowledge gap. To date, the substrates for C.
jejuni GTs have been confirmed in the Campylobacter genus, but structural information for PglA, PglJ, PglH1,
and PglH2 of C. concisus, another clinically significant human pathogen, is still unavailable. Additionally,
characterizing GTs from the same organism's glycoconjugate biosynthetic pathway will offer the structural
information needed for future protein-protein interaction studies and will pave the way for analysis to clarify how
these proteins interact to modulate pathway flux. Aim 1 of this proposal will identify preferred GT substrates
using nano-differential scanning fluorimetry (nanoDSF) and determine steady-state kinetic parameters using
luminescence-based GT activity assays. Aim 2 will be to discover the detergent and buffer conditions required
for crystallization of purified GTs, as well as to optimize protein crystals and collect X-ray crystal data to obtain
high-resolution crystal structures. Aim 3 will be to characterize a number of orthologs from a GT-B sequence
similarity network (SSN) in order to gain insight into GT evolution and to pinpoint the primary sequence variables
that account for their various substrate specificities. Interprotein covariance between GT residues will be
investigated via the GREMLIN method in order to identify interactions responsible for the hypothesized formation
of supramolecular complexes between these enzymes. The resulting findings will reveal binding determinants
controlling specificity for glycans prevalent in pathogenic prokaryotes and demonstrate crucial structure-function
links and protein-protein interactions.

Visual attention, the ability to select relevant information for prioritized processing, is a fundamental mechanism
for parsing a complex visual world. Importantly, attention is dynamic, acting across time to prioritize information
at behaviorally relevant moments, a process known as temporal attention. Although we know that temporal
attention affects visual perception, the neural mechanisms underlying temporal attention have been little
investigated. Specifically, it remains unknown 1) where in the human brain temporal attention influences visual
processing and 2) what cortical networks control the allocation of visual temporal attention. Here I propose to
investigate the sensory and control mechanisms of temporal attention using contemporary methods in human
visual neuroscience. The high spatial resolution of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) makes it an
ideal tool for investigating the roles of specific cortical areas; however, its slow temporal resolution has obscured
its potential value in studies of temporal attention. To circumvent this limitation, in Aim 1 I will use decoding
together with a tailored experimental design to determine where in the visual cortex temporal attention modulates
sensory processing. In Aim 2 I will use individual-observer mapping to identify control networks that guide
temporal attention and further analyze regions of interest to distinguish between possible control mechanisms.
In Aim 3 I will use the data collected in Aims 1 and 2 to test predictions of a recently introduced dynamic
normalization model of temporal attention and, if warranted, update its architecture and parameters to better
predict the neuroimaging data. Together these experiments and modeling will advance our understanding of the
neural mechanisms of temporal attention as well as our computational theories of dynamic attention.
Understanding these basic mechanisms is relevant for clinical populations with impairments in visual temporal
attention, including individuals with ADHD, neglect, and cerebellar degeneration.

Attention and arousal states play critical roles in influencing how we process information, from moment to
moment. While attention is believed to be strongly coupled with arousal states, the interaction between, and
independent properties of, attention and arousal in modulating visual processing remains poorly understood. In
this proposed research, I will employ a combination of novel functional neuroimaging methods and computational
modeling to examine how attention and arousal influence vision. Specifically, I will examine the modulatory role
of attention and arousal on one of the cornerstone properties of vision, contrast sensitivity—the ability to detect
an object from its background. After disentangling the independent and interactive modulatory effects of arousal
and attention on contrast processing, I will build arousal into computational models of attention in order to gain
insight into the potential canonical computations carried out by arousal and attention in influencing vision, which
in turn has the potential to shape a wide-range of downstream processes such as memory, decision-making,
and navigation. By revealing the extent and role to which attention and arousal alters early vision, results from
this proposal could further our understanding of the cortical and subcortical visual function of people with
abnormal arousal levels (e.g., attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, general anxiety disorder), and with potential
applications down the road in guiding the diagnoses and treatment of disorders that involve atypical arousal
levels.

Cell death is a fundamental process in animal development and homeostasis. Misregulation of
cell death is associated with a large number of human diseases. Our research program aims to
understand the diverse mechanisms of cell death, how dead cells are efficiently removed, and
the physiological effects on organisms when these processes go awry. We study these
questions in Drosophila, a model organism with exceptional genetic, genomic and cell biological
tools. Our research program focuses on several major projects. The first project investigates
non-apoptotic cell death which contributes significantly to development and disease, but is
poorly understood. In the Drosophila ovary, germline-derived nurse cells undergo non-apoptotic
programmed cell death as part of normal development. We have found that nurse cell death is
controlled largely non-autonomously by the surrounding somatic follicle cells by phagocytic and
lysosomal proteins. Ongoing work will uncover the subcellular mechanisms controlling nurse cell
destruction. A second major project investigates how dead cells are removed, particularly in
tissues without access to circulating phagocytes such as macrophages. In many mammalian
tissues, dead cells can be cleared by epithelial cells. In a Drosophila model for engulfment by
epithelial cells, starvation induces degeneration of egg chambers, where the germline is
engulfed by the surrounding epithelial follicle cells. This engulfment process happens
synchronously and rapidly at the onset of cell death; however, the genetic requirements for
engulfment by epithelial cells are not well understood. In particular, how such non-professional
phagocytes increase their phagocytic capacity is not known. Our research program is revealing
how epithelial cells transform to a phagocytic state and how they act to promote cell death. A
third project addresses the consequences of defective phagocytosis in the brain which we have
found leads to neurodegeneration and immune activation. Future work will investigate the links
between phagocytosis, immune signaling and neurodegeneration. We will determine the cell-
type-specific responses to defective phagocytosis and susceptibility to neurodegeneration. A
fourth project investigates cross-tissue interactions in response to cell death in the maintenance
of homeostasis. Given the high degree of conservation of cell death mechanisms between
Drosophila and mammals, we expect that pathways that we uncover in the fly will provide
insight into the diversity of cell death mechanisms and consequences of defective cell removal
in humans.

Despite their important role in birth defects and infant mortality, the 3-D and 4-D patterning
processes that employ multiple signals to drive embryonic development and morphogenesis are
not mechanistically understood. The long-term goal is to obtain a complete molecular description
of 4-D pattern formation, using the simple yet relevant sea urchin larval skeleton as a model. The
central objective in this application is to define a model that captures how the ectoderm expresses
different patterning cues in different regions over space and time using systems biology
approaches, to integrate that network with our spatiotemporal patterning cue reception network
in the responsive skeletogenic cells, then use that network model to identify the underlying
general principles for spatiotemporal deployment of and response to patterning instructions. The
main hypothesis is that differential spatiotemporal expression of the set of signals that regulate
skeleton formation is the central driver of embryonic pattern formation and is hard-wired into the
ectodermal gene regulatory networks that regulate skeletal patterning, while the reception of
those cues drives the spatiotemporal diversification of the skeleton-producing PMCs that in turn
mediate morphogenesis. The expected outcomes are (i) a validated single-cell level set of
interconnected spatiotemporal network models that define the presentation and reception of
patterning cues between the relevant tissues and (ii) computational models that capture the
overall network and that will allow rigorous analysis of the networks' functions. The research
proposed in this application is innovative, in the applicant's opinion, because it utilizes novel
analytical approaches and tools developed by the applicant's group, including a novel scRNA-seq
data analysis algorithm, a new tool for automated 3-D mapping of skeletogenic cells from confocal
image stacks, and polychrome skeletal labeling for post-hoc dynamics analysis. The proposed
research is significant because will establish a highly resolved molecular map of a 4-D
developmental process for skeletal patterning that will offer insight into the general principles that
underlie complex pattern formation. Because of the conservation of many of the relevant
patterning cues between sea urchin and human skeletons, this knowledge may ultimately lead to
new approaches for the prevention or treatment of skeletal birth defects and new strategies for
synthetic biomineral production.

 Although fluorescence microscopy has matured into a prevalent imaging method for biomedical researchers,
fluorescence spectroscopy exhibits several fundamental limitations: (1) lack of composition information; (2)
inability of imaging small biomolecules; (3) color barrier of multiplexing imaging; (4) lack of chemical sensitivity.
 To this end, the advent of stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscopy have revolutionized chemical
imaging. Most importantly, recent developments have proven that SRS microscopy can be complimentary to
fluorescence in addressing the above-mentioned limitations: (1) revealing chemical compositions by targeting
their endogenous chemical bonds; (2) employing a set of bioorthogonal vibrational tags (such as C≡C, C≡N,
carbon-deuterium C-D and 13C isotope) to image small biomolecules; (3) presenting an appealing strategy to
surpass the “color barrier” when coupled with super-multiplexed probes; (4) containing information about
structure and dynamics of the target molecule, as well as its interaction with environment.
 Although SRS has the promise to emerge as the next major modality in biophotonics, its utility has been
limited in the following two major aspects. First, the sensitivity of SRS microscopy has reached an impasse.
Currently, the detection limit cannot image many important small analytes and chemical drugs inside cells, which
are below the concentration of 100 micromolar. Second, although SRS is compatible with live cell biology, the
application of SRS inside live cells is significantly under-explored, largely due to that the available probes for
SRS imaging are seriously lagging behind. As such, many advanced applications of chemical imaging have not
been realized.
 We propose to develop the next-generation, ultrasensitive SRS microscopy by integrating innovations from
imaging instrumentation, probe chemistry and data science. We will employ a new laser source to push SRS
microscopy to the nanomolar range for small fundamental chemical bonds. Meanwhile, we will systematically
develop a library of responsive Raman sensors that can enter live cells and monitor important analytes there.
Moreover, we will deploy newly developed machine learning algorithms to further assist live-cell imaging. When
fully optimized, this will bring SRS microscopy to the ultimate sensitivity (comparable to that of fluorescence
microscopy), and fully open the application in live cell biology.

The objective of the proposed research is to 1) understand if activity of various cell types in DLPFC is consistent
with computational models of decision-making, and 2) investigate if there is a functional hierarchy in macaque
monkey dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) during decision-making. Decision-making is our ability to choose
and perform appropriate actions based on sensory cues and context to achieve behavioral goals. DLPFC is a
key decision-making brain region which receives inputs from higher-order sensory areas and sends outputs to
premotor cortices. DLPFC is also implicated in disorders of decision-making such as schizophrenia but currently,
it is unknown how circuit-level disruptions in this disorder result in its perturbed function. Specifically, we do not
understand 1) how different cell types in DLPFC mechanistically enable decision-making and 2) the spatial
organization of function in this area. We address these questions by combining in vivo neurophysiology with
computational modeling in DLPFC of monkeys performing our novel red-green reaction time checkerboard
discrimination tasks. Our first aim tests three emerging hypotheses of the role of cell types during decision-
making: 1) are inhibitory cells choice-selective or -nonselective during decision-making? 2) Do inhibitory neurons
exhibit contra-specific rather than ipsi-specific connectivity? 3) Do either somatostatin- (SST+) or parvalbumin-
positive (PV+) support decision-making through choice-selectivity? In this first aim, we will first build several cell-
type specific computational models of decision-making to establish predictions of neural dynamics during the
task. We will then use laminar multi-contact electrodes to record single neurons from DLPFC of monkeys
performing our novel red-green reaction time checkerboard discrimination task. With these recorded responses,
we will adjudicate between the models. Finally, we will examine each unit’s electrophysiological properties
(waveform shape and firing rate patterns) with our recently developed and validated approach that allows us to
delineate putative cell types (PhysMAP). With these identified populations, we will test predictions made by our
cell type-specific mean-field models of decision-making. In our second aim, we will test three competing theories
this time regarding the nature of functional gradients in DLPFC: 1) the “modular hypothesis” that different areas
are qualitatively distinct in their representations; 2) the “gradient hypothesis” that different areas contain the same
information which differs quantitatively in the “amount”; or 3) the “hierarchical hypothesis” that “upstream” areas
contain all decision variables whereas "downstream” areas only contain action-oriented variables. We will record
from DLPFC across several anatomical axes during two variants of the checkerboard task. We will then use
decoding and population analysis approaches like demixed principal component analysis to understand the task
representations of DLPFC at each location. Impact: This project will elucidate the in vivo spatio-temporal and
microcircuit dynamics in a clinically relevant brain area. Such data is a prerequisite for future development of
circuit-level therapeutics for mental illness and brain machine interfaces for recovery following brain injury.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Reading comprehension is supported by a hierarchy of cognitive-linguistic processes such as
recognizing words, mapping semantics onto words and phrases, and integrating information across units. In
bilingual individuals, successful reading comprehension must also include some mechanism of language
selection to enable reading in the target language given that both languages are active during linguistic
processing. Due to stroke, bilinguals with aphasia (BWA) routinely demonstrate impairments in reading
comprehension and language selection—in addition to other cognitive-linguistic deficits—which may severely
compromise their ability to access and select appropriate lexical representations in one or both languages
while reading. Previous studies in healthy bilinguals have used eye-tracking-while-reading to determine the
effect of contextual information on real-time sentence comprehension; however, it is currently unknown
whether BWA are sensitive to the same types of information or whether they demonstrate similar patterns of
language co-activation post-stroke.
 The overall goal of this proposal is to address this gap in the literature through a series of eye-tracking-
while-reading experiments to measure the effects of semantic and lexical variables on real-time sentence
processing in BWA. Eye-tracking-while-reading designs are ideal for examining real-time reading because they
permit subjects to i) view all words in a sentence throughout the trial (i.e., without pressing a button to uncover
them) and ii) return to earlier words or phrases for rereading which is especially important for BWA who will
require more time to retrieve lexical representations and process the meaning of a sentence. In the current
proposal, Aim 1 will examine the effects of reading cognates, which share overlapping orthographic and
semantic representations (e.g., piano in English and Spanish), and semantically constrained sentences on
real-time sentence processing. Aim 2 will examine the effects of reading interlingual homograph words, which
overlap in orthography but diverge in meaning (e.g., fin, animal part in English, end in Spanish), and
semantically constrained sentences on real-time sentence processing. Aim 3 will examine the relationship
between eye tracking outcomes and offline measures of language proficiency, linguistic impairment, and
nonlinguistic cognition to investigate the effects of individual variability in BWA reading behaviors post-stroke.
 By achieving these aims, this project will advance our understanding of reading comprehension
impairment in BWA. Ultimately, such findings can be used to enhance clinical outcomes for this population and
will represent an important first step in improving quality of life and access to literacy post-stroke.

Cancer has killed over 600,000 people in US in 2020. The cost for healthcare and society is unbearable: because 
of cancer, $180B healthcare expenditure and $134B lost productivity are recorded every year. This is happening 
despite recent advancements in therapy and the emergence of an ever expanding array of new therapeutics for 
the over 1.8M new cancer patients every year. Indeed, because of the multitude and redundancy of mechanisms 
contributing to cancer growth, therapies are often ineffective. Several components should be targeted at the 
same time in order to maximize therapy outcome. However, this is particular hard to attain because of 1) the 
striking variability among cancers and the limited number of cancer specific targets 2) the ability of cancer cells 
to orchestrate a microenvironment of healthy tissue and cells around them, that promote cancer growth and 
therapy resistance. Boston Immune Technologies and Therapeutics (BITT) is developing BITT-1492, able to 
target both cancer cells and their microenvironment. BITT-1492 is an antagonist antibody against TNFR2 – a 
receptor highly expressed in cancer tissue and immune suppressive cells in the microenvironment, where it 
mediates pro-survival signaling. Thanks to BITT’s proprietary antibody design platform, BITT-1492 is the first 
and only antibody able to dominantly shut down TNFR2 signaling. Due to selective expression and key role of 
TNFR2 for a variety of cancers and tumor microenvironment cells, BITT-1492 will find application in the therapy 
of several cancers, starting with Cutaneous T cell Lymphoma (CTCL), where TNFR2 is known to act as an 
extremely potent oncogene. BITT has already completed extensive pre-clinical validation for BITT-1492, 
demonstrating potent activity in CTCL, colon and ovarian cancers. In the proposed Fast-Track project, BITT will 
complete a pre-clinical toxicology and pharmacology assessment of BITT-1492 to obtain relevant data for an 
Investigational New Drug (IND) application. This will be accomplished by performing, in line with ICH guidelines, 
an exploratory small-scale toxicology study to be carried out in Phase I, that will demonstrate the safety of use 
of BITT-1492 for a wider IND-enabling toxicology and pharmacokinetic studies in Phase II. As part of the PhaseII 
BITT will also test the suitability of BITT-1492 production process for cGMP standard compliance. At the end of 
the SBIR project, BITT will be ready to advance BITT-1492 to clinical testing for which a combination of Venture 
Capital seed funds and SBIR PhaseIIb are expected to be leveraged. The successful completion of this project 
and initial clinical testing evidence will help to secure the already expressed interest of pharmaceutical 
companies with whom BITT will engage to complete late-stage clinical testing and launch BITT-1492 into 
international markets.

 Various cellular processes generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as superoxide
and hydrogen peroxide, which are key mediators of signaling pathways. Dysregulated redox
homeostasis and ROS generation are hallmarks of diseases including cancer and age-
associated degeneration. Primary cellular targets of ROS are cysteine thiols that form sulfenic,
sulfinic, and sulfonic acids, as well as disulfides. ROS generation is localized to specific cellular
regions, and are short-lived, necessitating spatiotemporal methods to study cysteine oxidation
events. We have developed a chemical-proteomic strategy, termed isoTOP-ABPP, to study
diverse oxidative cysteine modifications. To provide the necessary spatiotemporal readout, we
will expand our current isoTOP-ABB platform by: (1) utilizing caged cysteine-reactive probes
that can be activated rapidly by light for temporal control of cysteine labeling; and, (2) adapting
the TurboID proximity biotinylation method to spatially localize our analysis to specific regions of
the cell. We will apply these spatiotemporal readouts to two ROS-generating systems in the cell:
(1) growth-factor mediated activation of NADPH oxidase (NOX); and, (2) inhibition of the
electron transport chain (ETC) and mitochondrial superoxide dismutase.
 Epidermal growth factor (EGF) binding to EGFR, activates ROS release via NOX2. We
aim to identify cysteine oxidation events proximal to NOX2 and characterize the role of these
oxidation events on growth-factor signaling. In early studies, we identified a redox-active
disulfide bond in a fatty-acid binding protein, FABP5, which is formed upon EGF stimulation of
A431 cells. We will investigate the effects of disulfide-bond formation on the lipid-binding
properties of FABP5, and downstream signaling pathways mediated by growth-factor
stimulation.
 The mitochondria are highly redox-active organelles, and we aim to provide a
comprehensive view of oxidation targets during mitochondrial dysfunction, by selectively
enriching mitochondrial proteins prior to analysis. We will apply our optimized mitochondrial
methods to interrogate cysteine oxidation in a C. elegans SOD-2 mutant with elevated
mitochondrial ROS, and extended lifespan.

 Polyploidy frequently arises in response to injury, aging, and disease. Despite its prevalence, major gaps
exist in our understanding of how polyploid cells alter cell, tissue, and organ physiology. This is part because
polyploid cells are heterogeneous and arise in distinct ploidy states (mononucleated and multinucleated) with
each nucleus having varying sets of chromosomes. It is therefore hypothesized that the heterogeneity of ploidy
states provides cells with a vast repertoire of mechanisms for tissue growth, repair, and adaption to stress. Using
the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, as a model my laboratory has identified the core cellular and genetic
mechanisms regulating polyploid cell growth in epithelial wound repair and aging as well as novel physiological
roles for polyploidy in resistance to genotoxic stress and enhancing tissue mechanics. Since mononucleated
and multinucleated cells arise in adult Drosophila epithelium in response to injury, similar to vertebrates, we can
determine how a cell’s ploidy state affects its cellular, tissue, and organ physiology and disease susceptibility.
The goals of this project are to 1) determine how ploidy state, both mononucleated and multinucleated epithelial
cells responds to and protect against UV-induced DNA damage and 2) elucidate how ploidy state alters a cell’s
actomyosin network to enhance epithelial tension and restore organ movement in the fruit fly post wound repair.
Doing so, will provide fundamental insights into the versatility of polyploidy and how a cell’s ploidy state impacts
human health and disease.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
The sensory thalamus serves as a hub for incoming information encoding different features of the
outside world. This information is parsed and modified as it is transmitted to the cortex. In the visual
thalamus (the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus), retinal ganglion cell axons converge onto proximal
dendrites of thalamocortical neurons, forming clusters of boutons that stud the dendrites. Many of
these bouton clusters are ensheathed by astrocytes along with synaptic terminals from
neuromodulatory projections and inhibitory dendrodendritic presynaptic terminals. Collectively, this
synaptic motif is called the glomerulus, described beautifully by electron microscopy in many thalamic
nuclei and across many species. While the glomerulus is quite striking, the functional relevance of
this structural motif is still debated.
To address this critical question, here, we propose to establish and characterize mice in which the
glomerular astrocytic sheath is disrupted by genetic deletion of a member of the family of fibroblast
growth factor receptors. Our preliminary data shows that deletion of this receptor from astrocytes
results in reduced astrocytic sheaths around clusters of retinal ganglion cell boutons and aberrant
retinogeniculate functional refinement. We will extend these findings to elucidate the role of this
receptor in the development of astrocytic morphology, glomerular structure and the elimination and
strengthening of retinogeniculate synapses in the visual thalamus. We will also examine whether and
how defects in astrocytic ensheathment of the glomerulus may contribute to aberrant retinogeniculate
synapse refinement. Finally, we will take advantage of the disrupted glomerular ensheathment in
mutant mice to test the hypothesis that the glomerular structure enhances crosstalk between
synapses within the astrocytic sheath that is mediated by glutamate and GABA spillover.
If these proposed experiments are successful, results from these studies will advance our
understanding of how information is organized in the thalamus and the functional sequela of
disruption of this organization.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Project Summary/Abstract
 Pancreatic cancer (PC) is one of the most lethal forms of cancer in the United States (5-year survival rate
 below 10%). PC patients are usually diagnosed with a non-resectable disease (80-85%) and have a dismal
 prognosis with a survival period of only 3-6 months after the diagnosis. Nucleoside analogs (e.g., gemcitabine
 and fluorouracil) and platinum-based antineoplastics (e.g., oxaliplatin) are commonly used as chemotherapy
 for PC. When administered as free drugs, gemcitabine (Gem), fluorouracil (5-FU) and oxaliplatin (Oxa) display
 significant off-target toxicity causing life-threatening adverse effects in many patients. There is an urgent need
 to develop new therapeutic strategies consisting of delivery vehicles able to target PC cells, limit Gem, 5-FU
 and Oxa off-target toxicity and improve the overall anticancer response.
 We have recently patented a platform that uses an unbiased and quantitative screening algorithm for the
 discovery and validation of cancer-specific surface antigens. Our recently published results show that
 Intercellular Adhesion Molecule 1 (ICAM1), a transmembrane glycoprotein of the immunoglobulin superfamily,
 is aberrantly overexpressed in PC and can serve as a PC-specific target. Our results suggest that developing
 a novel ICAM1-based precision nanomedicine can be successfully utilized to treat PC patients.
 We have recently developed a magnetic extrusion technique to synthesize endosome-derived vesicles
 called exosome mimetics (EMs) in a highly efficient and reproducible manner. Our EMs share the same
 biological origin, morphology, nanosize and composition with exosomes, a class of natural cell-secreted
 extracellular vesicles. Our EM synthesis outperforms conventionally used exosome isolation and loading
 protocols in terms of particle yield, batch-to-batch consistency, reproducibility and loading efficiency.
 In this proposal,we leverage our expertise in cancer-specific antigen discovery and validation, bio-
 nanomaterial engineering, and exosome biology to test the novel hypothesis that EMs expressing ICAM1
 nanobody and loaded with Gem, 5-FU and Oxa can be used as a novel delivery vehicle for PC therapy. We
 will synthesize EMs engineered with ICAM1 nanobodies that recognize and kill ICAM1-expressing PC cells
 and load them with Gem, 5-FU and Oxa. ICAM1-EM will exhibit increased tumor specificity and reduce Gem,
 5FU and Oxa off-target delivery and toxicity. These innovative studies have the potential to lead to the
 development of novel EM-based therapies that can improve the efficacy of current cancer drug delivery.
 With key experimental tools, in vivo models and extensive experience in place, we will address the
 following Specific Aims:
1. To engineer ICAM1-targeted exosome mimetics (ICAM1-EMs) using magnetic extrusion method
2. To determine the efficacy of loaded ICAM1-Chemo-EMs in inhibiting PC growth and progression
3. To determine the pharmacokinetics (PK) and biodistribution of loaded ICAM1-Chemo-EMs

 Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a life-threatening disorder characterized by elevated lung
pressure, right heart failure, and premature death. Current therapies fail to prevent disease progression due to
their inability to suppress and reverse obliterative lesions resulting from vascular remodeling. Previous studies
have centered on large arteriolar remodeling in vessels with a diameter >100 µm. However, the role of the
capillary bed (vessels <10 µm) in remodeling remains largely ignored. Pericytes (PCs) are indispensable mural
cells for maintaining capillary integrity and homeostasis. Our preliminary data showed that the loss of PCs
induced excessive capillary and arteriolar remodeling and manifested hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension
and right ventricular hypertrophy in transgenic animals. Additionally, human idiopathic PAH (IPAH) PCs showed
high proliferation and motility, and human IPAH induced-pluripotent stem cells (IPAH-iPSC) derived mural cells
lost PCs but gained more smooth muscle characteristics. Vascular organoids derived from IPAH iPSCs further
demonstrated a reduced number of endothelial cell (EC) tubes and increased smooth muscle coverage, which
recapitulated abnormal vasculature development without PCs. Single-cell RNAseq revealed upregulated
expression of the Regulator of G-protein signaling 5 (RGS5) in the IPAH PC cluster, which was validated in IPAH
PCs isolated from explanted lungs, hypoxic mouse PCs, and explanted IPAH lung tissues. Thus, we
hypothesize that RGS5 overexpression mediates PC dysfunction (detachment and migration) and, in
turn, capillary remodeling in IPAH. We proposed to 1) Characterize the impact of PC dysfunction on EC
dysfunction, vascular integrity, and remodeling in PC-depleted transgenic animals; 2) determine how RGS5
signaling regulates PC detachment, proliferation/migration, and EC interaction in clinical IPAH samples; 3)
Characterize the impact of RGS5 depletion on PC/EC cell-cell interactions in IPAH iPSC vascular organoids.
This project will provide novel insight into PC pathobiology in capillary remodeling and establish RGS5 as a
potential therapeutic target in PAH, for which the first drugs to treat this devastating disease may be found.

Hemizygous microdeletions encompassing TBX1 cause 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS), the most
common deletion syndrome in humans. Among a broad spectrum of clinical features that often include
craniofacial dysmorphia, congenital heart defects (CHDs) of the outflow tract (OFT), and aortic arch, which is
derived from embryonic vessels termed pharyngeal arch arteries (PAAs), are the main causes of mortality
during childhood. Importantly, specific craniofacial muscles, the OFT, and PAAs all derive from the pharyngeal
apparatus, a transient series of arches and pouches that form by segmentation on the lateral surface of the
head. Because segmentation is severely compromised in Tbx1-deficient animals, their craniofacial and
cardiovascular defects were considered secondary. Using zebrafish as a model, my laboratory reported that
tbx1 mutant embryos recapitulate several aspects of 22q11.2DS, including craniofacial muscle, OFT, and PAA
deficiencies. We also demonstrated that these end structures descend from nkx2.5+ progenitors initially
specified in the anterior lateral plate mesoderm (ALPM) before becoming sequestered in the cores of the
pharyngeal arches. Unexpectedly, we discovered that tbx1 mutants fail to specify the nkx2.5+ pharyngeal
lineage in the ALPM that gives rise to the missing derivatives. Because this phenotype precedes pharyngeal
segmentation, defects in progenitor specification are likely causal for the deficiencies observed in tbx1
mutants. The aberrant fates of these progenitors, which maintain hand2 and gata5 expression in the ALPM,
are unknown. Moreover, the molecular mechanisms by which Tbx1 directs specification of the pharyngeal
lineage in the ALPM have not been elucidated in any model system. Here, we have the unique opportunity to
uncover the molecular mechanisms by which Tbx1 directs specification of the pharyngeal progenitor cell
lineage because we have defined the relevant developmental time window for analysis, identified markers of
the preserved (gata5+) and missing (nkx2.5+) progenitor populations, implemented single-cell RNA and ATAC
sequencing that allows for unprecedented resolution of changes in cellular populations and chromatin
accessibility, and generated state-of-the-art genetic tools for tracking the aberrant fates of tbx1-expressing
cells in tbx1 mutants and for identifying Tbx1 target loci that confer the pharyngeal progenitor cell fate. Overall,
we propose to use the attributes of the zebrafish system, including its genetic tractability, unmatched
embryonic accessibility, and imaging capabilities, to reveal new mechanistic insights that will provide the most
comprehensive view of how Tbx1 is necessary and potentially sufficient for instructing the pharyngeal
progenitor cell lineage during vertebrate development.

Valvular heart disease is an important health problem afflicting over 2.5% of the US population and catheter-
based therapies to address it have advanced significantly in recent years. While surgical repair remains the
gold standard, the reduced risk of catheter-based interventions has provided the ability to intervene earlier in
the disease process and in patients too sick for surgery while avoiding the risks of cardiopulmonary bypass.
A significant limitation of these procedures, however, is that they do not provide the capability to remove
native tissue and previously implanted devices to tailor the anatomy to receive a new prosthetic device. For
example, transcatheter valves rely on displacing the diseased valve leaflets rather than removing them. In
transcatheter aortic valve replacement, the displaced leaflets can obstruct blood flow to the coronary arteries
and prevent access for subsequent coronary interventions. In transcatheter mitral valve replacement, the
native anterior leaflet can be forced into the left ventricular outflow tract resulting in restricted flow into the
aorta. Recently, a transcatheter technique has been introduced to lacerate a leaflet along its midline from
base to tip. When performed prior to transcatheter valve replacement, the new valve spreads the two halves
of the old leaflet apart so that they do not interfere with blood flow. This innovative approach can increase the
number of patients who qualify for these low-risk procedures. Since the procedure relies on the use of existing
guidewires and catheters, however, it is technically challenging, requires multiple clinicians to perform and
takes more time than valve replacement. Furthermore, the electrosurgical ablation used in these procedures
is not as effective for calcified tissue which is often present in native and bioprosthetic leaflets. To address
this need, we propose to develop a catheter-based technology that enables a single operator to perform
precise cutting of native and bioprosthetic leaflets regardless of calcification. In Aim 1, we will develop a
steerable cardioscopically-guided leaflet cutting catheter. We will develop and demonstrate the technology in
the context of aortic and mitral leaflet modification using electrosurgical cutting. In Aim 2, we will create a
laser-based leaflet cutting system to address the limitations of electrosurgery in calcified tissue. The
technology will be evaluated through in vivo testing and comparison with existing methods. Key innovations
of this research include real-time optical visualization of leaflets during cutting, the ability to cut a leaflet without
forming a wire loop through it, the development of laser-based cutting to precisely lacerate calcified tissue
and the characterization of emboli produced by leaflet laceration. This technology can provide a platform for
the future development of more sophisticated transcatheter tissue modification and device removal
procedures.

 Endothelial cell (EC) dysfunction is a key factor that promotes poor host defense, pro-thrombotic
cardiovascular complications and bleeding during respiratory viral infections. The applicant’s laboratory has
made long-standing contributions in vascular effects of sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), a circulating lipid
mediator important for EC resilience. This protective pathway is preferentially activated by HDL-bound S1P, thus
counteracting EC dysfunction and pathophysiology. However, the role of S1P in influenza viral infections in the
context of thrombosis and bleeding complications is poorly understood. This proposal develops a novel paradigm
to enhance vascular resilience while minimizing thrombotic and bleeding complications during virus-induced
pulmonary injury. We have developed designer HDL-like nanoparticles that chaperone S1P, namely, ApoA1-
ApoM (A1M)/S1P, for therapeutic activation of EC S1PR1 and suppression of vascular leak. A1M/S1P either
alone or together with other barrier protective agents such as angiopoietin-1 (ANGPT-1) and prostacyclin (PGI2)
enhanced EC barrier function in endothelial cells. In addition, the ApoA1 moiety of A1M suppressed cytokine-
induced NFkB activation and inflammatory gene expression. We hypothesize that sustained activation of
S1PR1/Gi signaling by HDL-S1P and cooperative interactions between EC protective pathways (ANGPT1/
Tie2 and PGI2/IP receptor) enhances pulmonary vascular recovery from respiratory viral infections
without inducing prothrombotic transformation of the endothelium. Specific aim 1 will evaluate HDL-S1P
activation of protective endothelial S1PR1/Gi signaling. Genetic mouse models of S1PR1 loss of function (EC
knockout), gain of function (EC transgenic) and Gi-biased signaling (S5A phosphorylation-defective mutant),
Apom KO or Apom TG mice will be analyzed to determine alveolar microvascular leak, integrity, thrombosis,
bleeding and resolution of inflammation during influenza virus-induced pneumonitis. Single cell (sc)RNA-seq
data from mice with viral pneumonitis will be deconvoluted to determine molecular mechanisms of paracrine
signal networks between EC and pericytes important in microvascular resilience. The second aim will determine
the mechanisms by which albumin-S1P/S1PR1 signaling in EC promotes thrombosis in the context of viral
infection. We will use Tie2 agonists together with EC-targeted S1PR1 agonists to control bleeding in the setting
of influenza infection. The third aim will develop combinatorial therapeutic approaches containing novel HDL-like
nanoparticles and Tie2 activators to suppress EC injury and thromboinflammation during viral host defense
responses. Designer HDL particles containing S1P that enhances the vascular resilience and HDL particles that
carry stable prostacyclin (PGI2) analogs will be combined with Tie2 activators to suppress thrombosis and
bleeding in lung on chip and mouse models. Together, this proposal aims to achieve a mechanistic
understanding of EC pathophysiology during respiratory viral infections and develop novel therapeutic strategies.

Congenital malformations are a major public health challenge. These conditions are often linked to maternal
metabolic dysfunctions like diabetes and obesity. Yet, the molecular mechanisms that couple metabolism to
the genetic programs that control embryonic development remain poorly understood. Neural crest cells are a
type of embryonic stem cell that is particularly sensitive to metabolic perturbations and has been directly linked
to multiple developmental abnormalities. Neural crest development is orchestrated by a complex gene
regulatory network that endows these cells with their unique properties, like stemness, multipotency, and the
ability to migrate. Our group has previously shown that proper deployment of this regulatory network depends
on the initiation and maintenance of a metabolic state of increased glycolytic flux. We recently observed that
this state of enhanced glycolysis contributes to the regulation of gene expression through a mechanism that
involves a newly described epigenetic mark called histone lactylation. By examining the deposition of this
mark, we identified cis-regulatory regions in the genome that respond to changes in the glycolytic state of
neural crest cells. Notably, these putative metabolism-responsive enhancers (MREs) are located in the loci of
neural crest genes that are upregulated upon metabolic reprogramming. Based on this preliminary data, we
hypothesize that specialized cis-regulatory elements allow gene regulatory networks to respond to changes in
cellular metabolism. We will test this hypothesis in three specific aims. First, we will characterize the patterns of
genomic deposition of specific lactylation marks and test if these patterns change upon manipulation of
metabolic state and lactate levels. We will define how these manipulations affect the organization of the
epigenomic landscape and gene expression patterns. Second, we will examine how histone lactylation is
deposited in the genome of neural crest cells. We will use a combination of genomics and functional assays to
test the hypothesis that YAP/TEAD and SOX9 promote lactylation by cooperating with lactylation writers. Third,
we will test if MREs respond to changes in glycolytic flux by performing STARR-seq in neural crest cells
subjected to metabolic manipulation. Finally, we will use genome engineering to delete MREs in neural crest
cells and test their requirement for transcription responses to metabolic reprogramming. These experiments
will define how metabolic state affects the epigenomic landscape and modulates the gene regulatory networks
that control embryogenic development.

Glaucoma and other optic neuropathies are characterized by retinal ganglion cell (RGC) non-regenerative
axon damage and eventual cell death. Optic nerve crush (ONC), which transects all RGC axons, is often used
to model this process, and to seek interventions that preserve RGCs and promote regeneration of their axons.
Following ONC in mice, ~80% of the RGCs die within 2 weeks, and virtually none of the survivors regenerate
axons. We and others have used ONC to identify interventions that lead to increased survival, increased
regeneration or both. However, these treatments are only partially effective and many relevant targets are not
well-suited for the clinic. It is therefore important to identify additional and improved promoters of survival and
regeneration. Kinases are key regulators of cellular responses to insults and stresses. Furthermore, because
of their discrete enzymatic activity, kinases are druggable targets. Thus, we performed a preliminary in vivo
CRISPR-assisted kinase screen paired with ONC in adult mice to determine which kinases prevent RGC
survival and axon regeneration. To our excitement, the first round of screening through 750 kinases identified
17 anti-survival and 5 anti-regenerative hits. Many of these hits represent new mechanistic and translational
insights. In the proposed study, we will first examine the mechanistic underpinnings of two novel target kinase
pathways (namely LKB1/SNRK and Mkk4/Mkk7) that we have already verified the efficacy of with larger
experimental cohorts beyond our preliminary screen. These experiments will allow us to more completely
understand their mechanisms of action to formulate ideal therapeutic interventions. Additionally, we will
complete the validation of our remaining target kinases with full experimental cohorts in the ONC model.
Finally, we will choose the most promising gRNAs with robust neuroprotective effects and test their ability to
protect RGCs in our recently developed glaucoma model. At the completion of these studies, we expect to
be well-positioned to leverage the knowledge generated here into druggable targets to treat multiple
conditions causing blindness.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Infantile nystagmus syndrome is an involuntary oscillatory movement of the eyes that begins in infancy and
persists throughout life. It is visually and socially debilitating. The underlying pathophysiology is poorly
understood, and no effective treatments exist. More than half of infantile nystagmus patients have an associated
retinal or optic nerve disorder. Nystagmus is thus thought to develop secondary to poor vision, suggesting that
proper development of the oculomotor system is dependent on visual input, particularly in the first two months
of life. The long-term goal of this research is to understand the pathophysiologic mechanisms in nystagmus
and identify potential new therapeutic targets. Extraocular muscles (EOMs) from patients with infantile
nystagmus display a number of abnormalities, including decreased innervation, small neuromuscular junctions,
and an increased proportion of slow myofibers. We have recently shown that these changes are also present
in a mouse model of nystagmus—albino mice—and that the first changes are present as early as P10, before
eye opening. The human samples also show central nucleation of muscle fibers and an increase in expression
of the immature form of acetylcholine receptor on the fast myofibers. These changes suggest that there is
continuous remodeling of the EOM innervation in nystagmus. Different EOM myofiber types are innervated by
different subtypes of oculomotor neurons (OMNs), which in turn receive different premotor inputs. The “fast”
and “slow” OMNs, which innervate fast and slow myofibers, respectively, have different roles in different types
of eye movements. EOMs, OMNs, and premotor inputs are all dependent on each other for survival. This leads
to the hypothesis that nystagmus results from improper development of the oculomotor circuitry. This proposal
aims to test this hypothesis in a mouse model of infantile nystagmus syndrome by (1) determining whether
OMN survival and subtype distribution are altered and how the developmental timing of any changes relate to
changes in EOM innervation and nystagmus onset and (2) determining whether the premotor synaptic inputs to
the OMNs develop abnormally in mice with nystagmus. Albino mice, which display spontaneous nystagmus,
will be assessed for changes in EOM innervation and myofiber subtypes and corresponding differences in
OMN survival and subtype distribution. Age of onset of nystagmus will be determined. Viral transsynaptic
tracing will delineate the first-order synaptic connections onto the ocular motor nuclei. In all experiments, albino
mice will be compared to wild-type littermates, obtained from heterozygous matings, to control for genetic
background. Multiple developmental timepoints will be assessed to determine the point in development when
changes associated with nystagmus occur; whether changes in the EOMs, OMNs, or premotor inputs occur
first; and which changes precede nystagmus onset. This research will provide fundamental knowledge into the
mechanisms of infantile nystagmus. Understanding where and when the abnormalities in infantile nystagmus
first arise is the first step in identifying potential therapeutic targets or preventative interventions.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Project Summary: Brain MRIs are widely used in children for diagnosis and treatment monitoring. A typical
exam comprises multiple sequences with different contrast preparations, and often requires 20+ minutes to
complete. Potential motion during such lengthy acquisitions necessitates sedation or anesthesia. However,
repeated sedation or anesthesia in children increase the risk of long-term detrimental effects on cognitive
development. 40% of these pediatric scans also require gadolinium (Gd) based contrast agent (GBCA)
administration. It has been recently shown that Gd is retained in the brain and body, which may be particularly
harmful to children since their developing brains are more susceptible to heavy metal exposure, and free
lanthanides are known to be neurotoxic. Pediatric brain exams are excessively long because of inefficient use
of parallel imaging technology that only provides R=2–3-fold acceleration. Acceleration in two dimensions,
including the slice/partition axis, through controlled aliasing in parallel imaging (CAIPI) has enabled R=4–6-fold
speed-up, and has become popular in functional/diffusion imaging using simultaneous multislice (SMS)
encoding. Unfortunately, adoption of SMS in clinical sequences has been extremely slow. Acceleration via
Compressed Sensing (CS) is a promising solution, but its availability as a product solution is variable among
MR vendors, and it often comes at the cost of low-contrast image features. Deep learning (DL) has emerged
as a powerful reconstruction and image enhancement tool. Vendors’ DL solutions include denoising and super-
resolution enhancement, but these are limited to the newest software versions and host computers with GPUs.
While promising a better trade-off between image quality and scan time, they are currently implemented for a
small number of sequences on different vendors, and are therefore constrained by poor availability and
scalability. Thus, current clinical technologies have been hampered by limited availability and faster has often
meant suboptimal quality. Lastly, no vendor has DL-based solutions for Gd dose reduction for either adults or
children. Given the need for repeated injections of sedatives and GBCA in children who are scanned
periodically for treatment monitoring, there is an unmet need in imaging technology that makes these young
populations vulnerable to severe and long-term health risks. We propose data acquisition, reconstruction and
contrast enhancement strategies to address this unmet need. In Aim1, we will develop a rapid, comprehensive
brain exam by combining our advanced controlled aliasing strategy, wave-CAIPI, and extend this to SMS
encoding for rapid FLAIR/TSE imaging. Combining this with DL super-resolution reconstruction will enable
R=9-fold acceleration with high fidelity to create a 6-min protocol. In Aim2, we will develop and validate a DL-
based contrast enhancement algorithm to synthesize full dose images from 5× reduced Gd dose in pediatric
exams using our rapid protocol from Aim1. To that end, our novel technologies would speed up the clinical MR
exams and minimize both the amount of sedation and the injected contrast agents dose in children.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
T cell-B cell interactions that result in B cell maturation and antibody production were once thought to occur
exclusively in lymphoid organs. It is now appreciated that T peripheral helper (Tph) cells provide excessive
help to B cells resulting in autoantibody production in inflamed peripheral tissues. Such disordered Tph cell-B
cell responses have been implicated in some forms of chronic inflammatory arthritis in both adults and children.
The pathways that regulate the Tph cell-B cell axis in non-lymphoid tissues are not understood.
By studying joint fluid from patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), we found evidence of dysregulated
Tph cell-B cell responses in children with early-onset and anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) positive forms of the
disease. Our preliminary studies also identified a novel T cell subset, T peripheral regulatory (Tpr) cells, in
the joints of patients with JIA. These Tpr cells co-express regulatory T (Treg) and B cell-helper T cell factors.
Further, Tpr cells have the ability to inhibit Tph cell-B cell interactions that result in plasmablast generation in
our T cell-B cell co-culture system. The central hypothesis of this application is that Tpr cells restrain Tph cell-B
cell interactions in the joints of patients with inflammatory arthritis.
The central hypothesis in this research proposal will be tested with two Specific Aims that will be conducted
with biosamples (peripheral blood, synovial fluid, tonsil tissue) from children with JIA as well as healthy
controls. Through our established T cell-B cell co-culture system, Aim1 will assess the mechanisms by which
Tpr cells regulate Tph cell-B cell interactions. We will test the hypothesis that Tpr cells are uniquely equipped
to inhibit proliferation and cytokine production in B cell-helper T cells as well as antibody production, class
switching, and maturation in B cells by inducing alterations in gene expression and metabolism. Using a
multiomics approach coupled with functional assays, Aim 2 will define the developmental pathways and
transcriptional program required for Tpr functionality. We will test the hypothesis that Tpr cells differentiate from
Treg cells in the joint and have a unique transcriptional program that is distinct from other Treg subsets and
ensures Tpr functionality in tissues.
The research is innovative because we will use a systems immunology approach coupled with synovial fluid
samples from children with JIA to study T cell-B cell responses directly from affected tissues. Completion of
this research will be significant because Tpr cells represent a novel regulatory pathway with the capacity to
restrain Tph cell-B cell responses and ameliorate tissue-specific inflammation in arthritis and other autoimmune
diseases.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Summary
Pyroptosis is a most “explosive” and immunogenic form of lytic cell death involving spillage of
cellular contents, and has been defined as cell death mediated by the gasdermin (GSDM) family
of proteins. This breakthrough understanding was brought about in 2015 when gasdermin D
(GSDMD) was identified as a downstream effector of inflammasomes, which are supramolecular
complexes that activate inflammatory caspases (-1, -4 and -5 in human and -1 and -11 in mouse).
GSDMD gets cleaved by caspases to generate an N-terminal fragment (GSDMD-NT) and a C-
terminal fragment (GSDMD-CT), and GSDMD-NT was shown to mediate pyroptosis, as well as
the release of IL-1 family cytokines, which are processed by caspase-1 to the mature form. The
GSDM family comprises six members in humans (GSDMA, GSDMB, GSDMC, GSDMD,
GSDME/DFNA5, and DFNB59). In 2021, Ninjurin1 (NINJ1), a member of the NINJ family
comprised of 2 transmembrane proteins in mammals, was shown to act downstream of GSDMD
pore formation to induce the plasma membrane rupture required for full release of damage-
associated molecular patterns (DAMP) such as lactate dehydrogenase (LDH).
We and others found that upon cleavage by inflammatory caspases, GSDMD-NT specifically
binds to acidic lipids, and exhibits strong membrane-disrupting cytotoxicity in mammalian cells by
forming pores on membranes during pyroptosis and in vitro. Other GSDMs, upon cleavage by
appropriate proteases, also form transmembrane pores.
Here we propose to elucidate the structural mechanism of pore formation by the GSDM family,
and of membrane disruption by NINJ1. Understanding how GSDMs are regulated and exert their
pore forming activity, and how NINJ1 oligomerizes to induce plasma membrane rupture will not
only provide new insights on pyroptosis, but also afford new therapeutic strategies for treating
inflammasome-related and pyroptosis-related diseases.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Proper functions of all immune systems rely on maintenance of immune homeostasis. One family of immune
cells that play key roles in immune homeostasis are regulatory T cells (Tregs), a subset of T cells that prevent
excessive inflammation and autoimmunity. Tregs differentiate from naïve T cells in a manner that depends on
the transcription factor FoxP3. Loss-of-function mutations in FoxP3 lead to fatal multi-organ autoimmune and
inflammatory conditions. Despite the importance, the molecular functions and mechanisms of FoxP3 remain
poorly understood. We have recently made a significant progress in our structural approach to understand the
versatile mode of DNA recognition by FoxP3. We determined the crystal structure of FoxP3 in complex with
DNA (Leng et al, Immunity, 2022), breaking the decades-old dogma that FoxP3 forms a domain-swap dimer.
More recently, we found that FoxP3 recognizes a new motif composed of TnG repeats by forming a novel
multimeric assembly and that this is accompanied by bridging of two DNA molecules (unpublished). Additional
preliminary data suggest that this mode of DNA binding also occurs in Treg cells and is important for FoxP3
functions. These findings suggest an exciting new model: unique functions of FoxP3 in Treg development is
mediated by its ability to recognize TnG repeats and to form or stabilize DNA loops. We here propose three
aims to test and further develop this model. Aim 1 is to determine the cryo-EM structure of the FoxP3
multimers in complex with TnG repeats and to validate the structural mechanism using a combination of
biochemistry and cellular immunology. Aim 2 is to investigate functional consequence of such assemblies in T
cells using genomic approaches, such as ChIP-seq and HiChIP. Aim 3 is to identify and characterize the direct
interacting partners of FoxP3 that mediate its transcriptional function, and to investigate the role of FoxP3
multimerization on its interactome.
 Together, the proposed research builds upon a strong set of exciting findings from my lab and will have a
broad impact on TFs beyond FoxP3. That is, it will help understand how TFs can utilize a multimeric scaffold to
recognize new sequence motifs and alter chromatin conformation. Additionally, TnG repeats belong to a group
of genetic elements called microsatellites, which are often thought as “junk” or pathogenic. Thus, our work also
implicates a novel role for microsatellites in transcriptional regulation and, at the same time, FoxP3 as one of
the first exemplary TFs that exploit microsatellites for their functions.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
Malaria is an important global cause of morbidity and mortality. Most of this disease burden falls on children
and pregnant women and is caused by infection with Plasmodium falciparum. The signs and symptoms of
human malaria result from the exponential expansion of parasite biomass that occurs during asexual
replication of parasites in human red blood cells. During this clinically important blood stage, P. falciparum
parasites divide by schizogony – a process wherein components for several daughter cells are produced
within a common cytoplasm prior to a complex and synchronized cytokinesis known as segmentation.
Cytokinesis via segmentation is highly divergent from the process of cell division in human cells. The
generation of the invasive daughter parasites, known as merozoites, occurs with high fidelity, ensuring that
each daughter has a single nucleus and the required organelles. The fundamental molecular mechanisms
that facilitate segmentation are incompletely understand, and this is a significant knowledge gap.
Successful segmentation requires two parasite-specific structures, the inner membrane complex (IMC) and
the basal complex. The IMC is a double lipid bilayer with associated proteins that, together with an
underlying cytoskeletal network, dictates parasite shape and rigidity. The basal complex is a group of
proteins at the posterior (i.e., basal) end of the IMC. This multi-protein molecular machine is essential for
parasite cell division and is hypothesized to facilitate proper biogenesis of the IMC, likely to contribute to cell
shape, and to mediate the final abscission step of cytokinesis. In the current proposal, we will move
stepwise towards a molecular understanding of basal complex function. We have a high-confidence list of
basal complex components, and our preliminary data demonstrate that individual proteins define
subcompartments within the complex and dynamically join and depart the complex. In the first aim, we will
utilize high-resolution live-cell time lapse microscopy to determine the precise order of assembly and
disassembly of the basal complex. In the second aim, we will utilize super-resolution ultrastructure
expansion microscopy to localize individual proteins into subcompartments of the basal complex and
proximity labeling to identify novel components within these compartments. In the third aim, we evaluate the
requirement for the remaining basal complex components for segmentation and determine the minimal core
of proteins that are essential for basal complex function. In summary, the basal complex is essential for
asexual replication of P. falciparum, is insufficiently understood, and is not targeted by any current
therapeutics. The studies in this proposal will narrow the significant knowledge gap around the molecular
mechanisms of basal complex function and may identify important targets for future antimalarials.

 The objective of this proposal is to gain a deeper understanding of the genetic programs that give rise
to the development of specialized areas within the human cerebral cortex. Abnormalities in cortical
development can lead to a wide range of neurodevelopmental disorders, which often affect different cortical
areas differently. Despite of its significance, the process by which specialized areas develop remains poorly
understood. This proposal aims to address this gap of knowledge by studying primary tissue and human stem
cell-derived brain organoids. The first aspect of the research will utilize spatially resolved transcriptome
analysis to examine human fetal cortex samples from multiple areas and embryonic ages, to identify the genes
that are involved in area-specific neuronal fate specification. The second part will focus on developing the
method for inducing areal identities in human brain organoids by pharmacological manipulation of signaling
pathways, serving as a model for how morphogens induce area-specific cell fates in vivo. The proposed aims
are attainable due to the strong background of the candidate and supportive environment provided by the
mentor’s laboratory and the institution. The anticipated outcome of this research will be new insights into the
principles of human cortical development, which could shed light on the etiology of neurodevelopmental
disorders and ultimately transform our understanding of cortical development in health and disease.
 The candidate’s career goal is to become an independent researcher in an academic institution, leading
a research program that utilizes human stem cell models and neurogenetics approaches to study
neurodevelopmental disorders. The candidate’s prior research in the development and application of organoids
as model for human brain development and diseases sets a strong foundation. The proposal outlines a
comprehensive plan for scientific and professional growth that encompasses hands-on training, didactics, and
mentorship. Key scientific training goals include acquiring expertise in single-cell bioinformatics, spatial
transcriptomics, disease genetics analysis, and conducting rigorous optimization of organoid protocols.
Additionally, the candidate will engage in structured trainings in career development to facilitate independence.
The candidate will be mentored by Dr. Christopher Walsh, a renowned neuroscientist who has mentored
dozens of successful independent investigators. The candidate will also benefit from the support of an advisory
committee with complementary expertise. The mentored phase of the proposal will take place in the laboratory
of Dr. Walsh at Boston Children’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School, known for providing exceptional
research and training environments. The proposed training and research will provide the candidate with the
necessary resources and support to establish a thriving independent research program.

The long-term goal of this proposal is developed to uncover the molecular mechanisms and identify
critical regulators governing lymphatic vascular function in health and disease in hopes of offering
potential new therapeutic targets to combat cardiovascular and metabolic disorders. At the third year
of postdoctoral training, the PI has published his first postdoctoral project and presented his studies in
several prestigious conferences that pave the way for his transition to an independent investigator.
The lymphatic system is responsible for maintaining interstitial fluid homeostasis, immune cell
trafficking and lipid absorption. Lymphatic function participates largely in the pathogenesis of metabolic
and cardiovascular diseases such as obesity and atherosclerosis. How lymphatic dysfunction leads to
abnormal lipid transport and fat deposition, and conversely, how these metabolic diseases impair
lymphatic function are poorly understood but highly medically relevant questions. Embryonic mice
lacking Foxc2, a key transcription factor, prevents the formation and maturation of collecting lymphatic
vessels. Despite the crucial role of Foxc2 in lymphatic development and remodeling, little is known
about the role of Foxc2 in adult physiological and pathological lymphatic function; limitation is largely
due to a lack of appropriate animal models. In this proposed application, the PI recently has generated
novel inducible lymphatic endothelial cell (LEC)-specific Foxc2 gain-of-function and Foxc2 loss-of-
function mice. Utilizing these powerful genetic tools, the PI observed that deficiency of LEC Foxc2 in
adult mice dramatically increased the lymphangiogensis, improves impaired lymphatic drainage and
lipid absorption in metabolic disorders (unpublished data). In the K99 phase, the PI will continue the
current project to determine the molecular mechanism by which Foxc2 regulates adult
lymphangiogenesis and lymphatic function in obese model. While in R00 phase, the PI will investigate
the role of Foxc2 in modulating macrophage cholesterol efflux and reverse cholesterol transport in
atherosclerotic model, as well as how Foxc2 will affect atherogenesis, which is diverging from his
mentor’s work on Epsin, a family of endocytic adaptor proteins. Moreover, other than the unique mouse
models and cutting-edge techniques, the PI will develop a novel LEC-specific nanoparticle delivery
system based on his recent published platform to specifically target LEC Foxc2, thus may halt
inflammation and inhibit atheroma progression. This proposal will be valuable for restoring impaired
lymphatics to treat cardiovascular and metabolic diseases.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Project Summary
Hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) is a fatal form of congenital heart disease characterized by the
underdevelopment of left-sided structures, including the left ventricle (LV), mitral and aortic valves, and
ascending aorta. These three structural deficiencies result in diminished circulation that invariably leads to
morbidity without surgical intervention. It is currently thought that HLHS is an oligogenic disease of co-
occurring structural defects caused by different genetic lesions. In some cases, however, one structural defect
might be primary and the others secondary. As HLHS is clinically heterogeneous, there are likely multiple paths
to disease pathogenesis caused by diverse, and often unknown, genetic etiologies. To begin studying the
affected genes in the context of heart development, I mined published databases for de novo and rare
inherited variants in HLHS probands for follow-up in zebrafish. I initially selected RBFOX2, a highly conserved
RNA binding protein (RBP), based on its strong statistical link to HLHS and lack of study in cardiac
development. I published that rbfox2 mutant zebrafish display all three HLHS-like structural heart defects that
arise secondary to compromised pump function (Huang et al. Nat Commun 2022). However, unlike patients
that are heterozygous for RBFOX2, heterozygous zebrafish and mice are healthy. Therefore, no appropriate
model exists to investigate how halving the dose of RBFOX2 affects CM biology. Moreover, many variants
statistically linked to HLHS remain unvalidated or unstudied in whole animal models. To address these
knowledge gaps, I engineered and characterized RBFOX2 het and null human (h) iPSC-CMs. Both genetic
cohorts show dose-dependent reductions in cell size, cell adhesion, calcium handling, and oxygen
consumption rates. Myofibril alignment is also perturbed. Based on this phenotypic characterization and
integration of several sequencing datasets, I propose to test the hypothesis that RBFOX2 directly regulates CM
cell adhesion and growth by controlling transcript stability and splicing of an ECM-cytoskeletal-myofibril gene
network in Aim 1. To identify additional HLHS-linked variants that cause cardiac phenotypes in zebrafish, I
conducted a pilot CRISPR screen and recovered an ortholog of FOXC2, which encodes a transcription factor
expressed in the endocardium and myocardium. Preliminary phenotyping revealed HLHS-like cardiac
phenotypes in foxc2 global knock-outs that also fail to activate a Notch reporter in the endocardium. In Aim 2, I
propose to test the hypothesis that endocardial-specific FOXC2-deficiency leads to primary valve and
secondary myocardial defects caused by defective Notch signaling. Overall, I anticipate learning that both
myocardial- and endocardial-intrinsic defects recapitulate specific aspects of HLHS. More broadly, implicating
human variants as causal for HLHS pathogenesis and deciphering their mechanism of action in whole animal
and human iPSC models will ultimately lead to better predictors of heart failure following surgical intervention
and new therapeutic inroads for patient-specific clinical management of the disease.

Candidate: Dr. Medina Jackson-Browne, PhD is an environmental epidemiologist with primary research
interests in the role of early-life environmental chemical exposures on the immune and respiratory systems
in children. The goal of this proposal is to obtain training in the skills to build Dr. Jackson-Browne’s research
career in pediatric clinical research. We propose several initiatives to strengthen Dr. Jackson-Browne’s
career. Specifically, Dr. Jackson-Browne will gain new research skills and enhance her understanding of
1) the clinical trial process with Dr. Phipatanakul, MD, 2) train in early-childhood immune system
development and respiratory physiology and 3) translate this research and training to position her for a
future R01. To achieve this goal, she will obtain training in clinical trial design, database design and
management, and advanced biostatistical methods. This will be accomplished with formal coursework,
collaborative work, attendance at conferences, and guidance from established mentors/scientific advisors
with relevant expertise. The proposed research and training plan builds the foundation for an independent
research career that aims to address gaps in the understanding of timing and mechanism through which
environmental chemical exposure affect respiratory health in early childhood.
Research: Early-life exposure to environmental chemicals, particularly chemical’s known to bioaccumulate
in humans, is of increasing concern in the development of asthma in children. Aeroallergen sensitization
is a pivotal risk factor for developing persistent, progressive asthma throughout life and sensitized children
have a higher prevalence of early-life wheeze and poor lung function. These potential associations are
particularly relevant to populations with higher exposure to these chemicals and those at a higher risk for
developing and/or dying from complications from asthma such as Black and low-income urban children.
This proposal details a five-year plan to provide Dr. Jackson-Browne with the training and expertise to
address gaps in the understanding of the timing through which perfluoroalkyl substance (PFAS) exposures
may affect asthma development in children by leveraging infrastructure of an on-going pediatric clinical
trial of 2-3-year-old infants at high risk of developing asthma (PI, Dr. Wanda Phipatanakul, MD).
Environment: Dr. Jackson-Browne will be mentored by Dr. Phipatanakul, an expert in epidemiology,
clinical trials, and clinical investigation in asthma and allergic diseases. She has assembled an
extraordinary team of advisors, including Drs. Jessie Buckley, Stephanie Lovinsky-Desir and Suzanne
Dahlberg who have committed their time, resources, and expertise to facilitate Dr. Jackson-Browne’s
career development and successful completion of the proposed project. The academic environment
created Boston Children’s Hospital and their affiliates provides an ideal training environment specific to
her goals of achieving research independence.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
Perinatal white matter injury (WMI) is a common sequela of neonatal brain injury. One of the leading causes
of neonatal brain injury and morbidity in premature infants is post-hemorrhagic hydrocephalus (PHH). PHH is
triggered by germinal matrix and/or intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) that results in accumulation of
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the brain ventricles. This accumulation of CSF can cause compression of
surrounding brain tissue and injury to the developing white matter. Specifically, in PHH the degree of
ventricular dilation is correlated with severity of WMI as measured by decreased myelination and increased
axonal injury, cellularity, and cytoplasmic vacuolation. Myelination in the central nervous system (CNS) has
been previously identified as dependent upon Autotaxin (ATX), which can be sourced via the CSF. The
choroid plexus (ChP) is the tissue which controls the amount and composition of the CSF and therefore helps
instruct the developing nervous system. Here, we examine expression and availability of ChP-secreted ATX
influencing white matter development and myelination of the mouse CNS and hypothesize this may be an
important signaling axis which could be therapeutically harnessed to treat WMI associated with PHH. The
Lehtinen Lab's single nucleus sequencing data demonstrates ATX expression across all epithelial cell
clusters, thereby suggesting the epithelial cells may secrete ATX into the CSF. In preliminary studies we
confirm that the ChP secretes ATX and show that ATX abundance in the ChP and CSF increase throughout
development, with a particularly noticeable upregulation in the critical postnatal window associated with
myelination of the CNS in mouse. In Aim 1, I will determine the effect of ChP-specific ATX modulation on
myelination using advanced in vivo mouse manipulation techniques to selectively delete or overexpress ATX
in the ChP. In Aim 2, I will further explore role for ATX in the pathophysiological mechanisms of WMI using
the lab's translationally relevant mouse model of neonatal PHH following IVH. The results of these studies
will inform our understanding of the mechanisms of hemorrhage induced WMI and will help guide rational
intervention strategies for treatment, thereby improving quality of life for patients and caregivers. The
proposed research will take place at Boston Children's Hospital under the guidance of Dr. Maria Lehtinen, an
expert in the field of choroid plexus and CSF biology, and will provide training in ChP in vivo manipulation
techniques, glial biology, exposure to clinical experience, and in the design of translationally relevant
preclinical studies. We will routinely consult with collaborators and mentors who are experts on both white
matter development and the neurologic sequelae associated with PHH of prematurity. The results from this
proposal will result in first-authored publications and a large body of support for a K99/R00 application, with
the goal of launching an independent academic career.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Project Summary/Abstract: Capillary Malformation (CM) is one of the most common vascular malformations.
CM comprises enlarged vessels lined with sprouting endothelial cells (EC) and disorganized mural cells. In
Sturge Weber Syndrome (SWS), a neurocutaneous disorder, CM occurs in the skin, brain, and eyes. Patients
may suffer from seizures, strokes, glaucoma, and only symptomatic treatment is available. CM is caused by a
somatic mutation in GNAQ, the gene that encodes the a-subunit of the G-protein – Gaq. The GNAQ mutation
– the arginine (R) at the amino acid position of 183 replaced by the glutamine (Q) – is enriched in ECs isolated
from CM in the skin, brain, and choroidal vessels of the eye. To date, little is known about how the R183Q
point mutation in the Gaq activation domain leads to abnormal capillaries. Moreover, nothing is known about
the interactions between the mutant EC and neighboring mural cells surrounding CM vessels. Our preliminary
data suggest that lentiviral transduced human EC expressing the R183Q allele (EC-R183Q) have high levels of
pro-inflammatory markers, a weaker junctional barrier, and exhibit heightened response to laminar shear
stress. Immunostaining of CM tissue sections also reveal disorganization in mural cell environment labeled
with Desmin, Calponin, NG2 and alpha-SMA. Moreover, our histological analyses of CM tissue sections
revealed MRC1pos, LYVE1pos and CD68pos macrophage-like cells surrounding the CM vessels of the brain and
skin suggesting a pro-inflammatory environment. The goal of this fellowship proposal and training plan is to
examine how the EC-R183Q interact with both the mural cells and macrophages. I hypothesize that EC-
R183Q triggers the disorganized assembly of mural cells and subsequent macrophage attraction to the
abnormal vessels. The proposed study will test this hypothesis through the following aims: (1) to identify
paracrine interactions between EC-R183Q and mural cells (2) to identify and characterize mural cell and
macrophage interactions with EC-R183Q in vivo. Completing these aims will provide new insights into the
relationship between EC and the surrounding mural cells and macrophages in the CM. This fellowship training
will provide me with technical, communication, and mentoring skills to leverage my next step to independence.
Working with Drs. Joyce Bischoff and Arin Greene (co-sponsor) at Boston Children’s Hospital will provide me
with an excellent training environment from both the basic science and clinical aspect of the proposed work.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Project Summary
A cardinal feature of anxiety disorders is exaggerated fear to cues signaling threat. Pharmacotherapies to treat
anxiety disorders overwhelmingly target the diffuse modulatory, serotonergic system, but have limited efficacy.
Dopamine is a diffuse, modulatory neurotransmitter known to regulate fear. Yet, dopamine-focused treatments
for anxiety disorders are not available. This proposal will test the novel hypothesis that A8 dopamine neurons
originating in the retrorubral field normally function to promote fear through projections to the ventral pallidum.
We have developed a discrimination procedure in which a minimal threat cue predicts foot shock on 10% of
trials, while a neutral cue never predicts shock. Rats show selective, modest fear to the minimal threat cue,
allowing us to observe fear exaggeration or fear inhibition via manipulation of A8 dopamine activity. Aim 1 will
reveal A8 dopamine bidirectionally controls ventral pallidum firing to a threat cue and cue-elicited fear. Th-cre
rats will receive bilateral intra-A8 infusion of a cre-dependent excitatory DREADD (hM3D), inhibitory DREADD
(hM4D), or a control fluorophore. All rats will receive Neuropixels implant along a striatum-pallidum axis. Single
units will be recorded from the ventral pallidum and additional striatal regions during minimal threat learning
when A8 dopamine activity is intact, chemogenetically excited or chemogenetically inhibited. Results will show
that hM3D stimulation of A8 dopamine suppresses ventral pallidum firing and exaggerates fear to minimal
threat, while hM4D inhibition of A8 dopamine permits ventral pallidum firing and inhibits fear to minimal threat.
Aim 2 will directly tie bidirectional control of fear to activity in the A8 dopamine to ventral pallidum pathway. Th-
cre rats will receive bilateral, intra-A8 infusion of cre-dependent channelrhodopsin, halorhodopsin, or a control
fluorophore. Optical ferrules will be bilaterally implanted over the ventral pallidum, permitting temporally-
specific manipulations of the A8 to ventral pallidum pathway. Light illumination will occur during cue or control
periods during the minimal threat learning procedure. Results will show that channelrhodopsin stimulation of
the A8 dopamine to ventral pallidum pathway exaggerates fear to minimal threat, while halorhodopsin inhibition
of the A8 dopamine to ventral pallidum pathway inhibits fear to minimal threat. This proposal will uncover a
novel dopaminergic pathway that normally functions to promote fear. Simultaneously, the results will reveal
selective inhibition of the A8 dopamine to ventral pallidum pathway as a promising target to effectively treat
anxiety disorders.

 Tuberculosis (TB) remains one of the leading infectious disease killers globally despite the availability of
robust diagnostics, effective prevention, and treatment. Poor implementation of comprehensive TB programs
and HIV infection remain drivers of ongoing high TB rates in high burden countries such as South Africa. In
South Africa there are many losses in the TB care cascade; an estimated 95% of individuals with TB access
evaluation, yet only 82% are diagnosed, 70% initiate treatment, and 53% successfully complete treatment.
However, it is also imperative to also screen and treat subclinical TB infection to lessen the vast reservoir of
people at risk of progressing to TB disease, especially recent contacts of TB patients and people living with HIV
(PLH). Using implementation science methods and building on the success of the improvements in the HIV
care cascade “90-90-90” targets, our team has recently piloted two TB care cascades for drug-resistant and
drug-sensitive TB as well as piloted a TB prevention program including home visits to over 304 families,
screening 922 household contacts of patients with TB.
 This R01 award will adapt the Systems Analysis and Improvement Approach (SAIA), an evidence-based
implementation science strategy combining systems engineering tools into a clinic-level package for TB (SAIA-
TB), expanding upon successful SAIA models trialed across a range of clinical settings in sub-Saharan Africa and
the USA, and leveraging the PI’s preliminary TB cascade analysis data in South Africa. SAIA-TB will evaluate six
comprehensive TB indicators (screening, evaluation, diagnosis, linkage to care, treatment, and TB-free
survival) to aid frontline healthcare workers and managers to optimize cascade performance through the use
of a TB cascade analysis tool, process flow mapping, and continuous quality improvement cycles.
Our specific aims are to: (1) Evaluate the effectiveness of SAIA-TB on cascade optimization for patients
with TB and high-risk contacts (specifically PLH). We will use a stepped-wedge crossover trial to evaluate the
impact of SAIA-TB on comprehensive TB care in 12 rural clinics. We hypothesize that SAIA-TB implementation
will lead to a 20% increase in TB screening and TB preventive therapy or TB disease treatment initiation during
the 2-year intervention period. (2) Determine the drivers of SAIA-TB implementation variability across clinics.
The implementation process will be described using focus group discussions and key informant interviews with
clinic staff, analyzed using the consolidated framework for implementation research, with additional data
gathered from study logs to describe fidelity to SAIA-TB. (3) Assess the acceptability of comprehensive TB care
among patients accessing care at clinics implementing SAIA-TB at each step of the TB cascade. We will use the
theoretical framework for acceptability and the socioecological model to define acceptability and compare
individual-, family- and system-level barriers and facilitators to completing TB cascade steps among patients
with and without HIV infection.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
Violence and humanitarian crises are common in the lives of children around the world, particularly in low- and
middle-income countries. Exposure to war-related violence is detrimental to the mental health of parents and
children, but research exploring mechanisms by which emotional and behavioral disruptions are transmitted to
subsequent generations remains nascent, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa. To help address this gap, a study
of war-affected youth has been underway since 2002 following a cohort of war-affected children—many, both
male and female, former child soldiers—in Sierra Leone into young adulthood, and now parenthood. A prior
NICHD-funded R01 (R01HD073349) demonstrated how childhood war-related trauma and loss contributed to
mental health problems in adulthood. In 2017, a cross-sectional sample of intimate partners and biological
offspring was added to the sample to examine linkages between early trauma exposure and both intimate
partner and parent-child relationships. Knowledge to date of how war-related stressors “get under the skin,” to
become heritable biophysical traits and the implications for the mental health of the next generation remain
limited. Of relevance are the Research Domain Criteria-related constructs of self-regulation and stress
reactivity and how they influence emotional, cognitive and social functioning of children. The proposed
research comprises a significant advance in the 20-year history of this study by advancing understanding of
potential biological embedding of stress responses intergenerationally. Building on four prior waves of data
collection, biological measures of stress reactivity and self-regulation (autonomic nervous system reactivity,
inflammation, telomere length) will be collected in a sample of parents exposed to significant trauma in
childhood and extended also to intimate partners and offspring. Strong capacity-building collaborations with
Sierra Leone’s University of Makeni (UNIMAK) and Kenema Government Hospital (KGH) will support the
ethical collection of new stress biomarker data and clinical assessments of parent-child synchrony, health, and
anthropometric data in biological offspring aged 7–24. Key study innovations are (a) rare prospective data on
parental trauma exposure and longitudinal information on risk and protective factors operating across the
social ecology; (b) data on biological embedding of stress responses related to parental trauma; and (c) the
opportunity to examine both mental health and physiological outcomes in biological offspring in war-affected
families over time. Advanced statistical techniques (e.g., latent class growth models, structural equation
models, lagged effects models) will articulate mechanistic pathways and priority targets for intervention.
Collaborations between investigators, UNIMAK, KGH, as well as community advisory boards will inform study
implementation, ensure strong retention of participants, and provide channels for dissemination. Analyses will
inform screening tools to identify families for preventive interventions. Intervention targets identified have
implications not just for war-affected settings, but also for assisting diverse populations affected by violence
and trauma, including migrants and refugees.

Polarized cells in retain their shape in every cell cycle and this is essential to their proper function. Anomalies
in polarized cell shape can result in cancer, metabolic disorders, and loss of tissue integrity. Here, we will
investigate a long-standing question of how cells consistently regain their polarity after each round of division.
This investigation will be conducted using the fission yeast, Schizosaccharomyces pombe model system that
provides many well characterized genetic tools to manipulate conserved proteins that influence cell shape
following division. Cdc42 is the major regulator of polarized growth. In fission yeast, cells halt polarized Cdc42
activation and consequent growth at the cell ends during mitosis. After completion of division, these cell ends
resume Cdc42 activation and cell growth. After division, Cdc42 activation and polarized growth always
resumes in a monopolar manner from the old end that pre-exists from the previous generation. The cell
transitions to bipolar growth when Cdc42 activation also resumes at the newly formed cell end in the G2 phase
of the cell cycle. Our preliminary data indicate that resumption of Cdc42 activation at the old end after division
and transition to bipolar activation in G2 are cell cycle dependent. Our central hypothesis is that Cdc42 is
differentially regulated at the cell ends by distinct cell-cycle-dependent cues to establish the cell polarization
pattern. We will test this hypothesis by pursuing the following specific aims, [1] Determine how Cdc42
activation resumes at the cell ends in the G1/S phase; [2] Elucidate how a memory of growth from the previous
cell cycle enables the pre-existing old end to initiate Cdc42 activation first; [3] Explain how the transition from
monopolar to bipolar growth occur in G2 phase. With this project we expect to mechanistically understand how
Cdc42 activation and associated growth patterns are modulated in different cell cycle stages. We will examine
how signals from one cell cycle inform the growth pattern in the next generation. This will provide much needed
insights into the principles that preserve polarized cell shape in complex systems. Due to the conserved nature
of the proteins involved in this investigation, we expect that our findings will be relevant cell shape control in
higher eukaryotes and provide potential therapeutic or diagnostic targets for diseases such as cancer.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) currently affects 1 in 59 children in the United States, 80% of whom are male,
and is characterized primarily by impaired social interaction/communication. Prenatal exposure to air pollution
has been implicated in the etiology of ASD, as well as many other neuropsychiatric disorders. However, the
mechanisms by which air pollution alters the development of social circuits in the brain remains unknown.
Importantly, there are large social disparities in environmental toxin exposure whereby marginalized communities
bear the greatest burden of exposure. Using a novel mouse model that combines an environmental toxin (diesel
exhaust particles; DEP) with an ethologically relevant maternal stressor (resource deprivation; MS), our
preliminary data show that these exposures in combination, but neither alone, induce robust deficits in social
interaction in male, but not female offspring. This is line with a model in which maternal psychosocial stress
unmasks vulnerability to environmental toxins in offspring. ASD is increasingly recognized as a whole-body
disorder. Gastrointestinal symptoms and changes in the composition of the gut microbiome are present in more
than 50% of individuals with ASD. Studies using animal models suggest a causal link between the gut
microbiome and social behavior, but this has not been studied in the context of environmental toxins. During the
K99 phase of this proposal, in Aim 1, I propose to further my training in the analysis of the gut microbiome to
ask whether cross-fostering of DEP/MS pups at birth can prevent shifts in the gut microbiome (assessed using
metagenomic sequencing). The dopamine system supports social interaction, is sensitive to microbial signaling,
and my preliminary data suggests is down-regulated following DEP/MS exposure. Thus, in Aim 2, I propose to
learn in vivo optogenetic techniques to test whether activation of the mesolimbic dopamine reward pathway is
sufficient to restore social behavior following DEP/MS. During the R00 phase, in Aim 3, I will use the techniques
acquired during the K99 phase to determine whether changes in the gut microbiome are responsible for changes
in social behavior and dopamine signaling in DEP/MS offspring. Moreover, I will use the preliminary data
gathered in Aim 1 to ask what potential metabolites or molecular mechanisms might be altered following
DEP/MS. Finally, I will ask whether microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain, play a key role in mediating
these microbiome-driven changes. Together, these experiments will elucidate the ways in which pollutants and
stress synergize to produce dysregulation of the gut-brain axis and deficits in social behavior.
 This proposal will significantly advance my career development by providing me with new training in
cutting-edge techniques such as in vivo optogenetics and metagenomic sequencing. Thus, it will help me to
establish my own independent line of work and the preliminary data obtained herein will serve as a foundation
for future R01 funding.

There is a widespread recognition that mental health is often neglected, under-resourced, and
underfunded, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) 1, 2. Experiencing traumatic
events as a child is often linked to mental health problems and higher levels of stress reactivity and
impact one's entire ecology with long-term intergenerational consequences 3. The treatment gap, is
more than 50% in all countries and can be as high as 90% in the least resourced countries 4. Sierra
Leone is one of many low and middle-income countries (LMICs) that have encountered challenges in
providing mental health services to their population, particularly children and adolescents 5-6. This has
been compounded by the country's experiences of war and the Ebola outbreak. The parent grant for
the proposed supplement is a mixed-method, longitudinal study evaluating the long-term effects of
war and trauma on parents and their relationships with their children, families, and communities.
Previous studies have noted the limitations of relying on self-reported family dynamics in post-
conflict settings, including Sierra Leone 7. There is a need for observational techniques and
instruments that are context-specific, current, biologically based, and tailored to fathers to supplement
self-report methods. The findings from this study will inform the development of decision-support
tools for lay-worker-delivered prevention models to support family interventions to address specific
needs, based on the family's distinct pattern of risk and protective factors.
 Specific Aims of the parent grant: The primary aims of the parent grant are as follows:
 (1) Investigate the biological embedding and long-term mental health consequences of war-related
trauma in a longitudinal sample of war-affected youth who have become parents (N=394).
(2) Examine associations between parental war-related trauma exposure, mental health, and biological
and physiological indicators of emotion, cognition, and social functioning in offspring aged 7–24
(N=410). (3) Identify and examine how modifiable risk and protective factors operate to identify
priority intervention targets to improve the physical and mental health of war-affected children and to
develop screening tools to identify families at risk.

Project Summary
Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are increasingly recognized as rewarding targets against which powerful
therapeutic drugs can be devised. This is perhaps best demonstrated by the remarkable success of the series
of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibody drugs developed to treat cancer. Despite the excitement, antibody-based drugs do
have a few limitations, including modest stability, lack of oral availability, poor tissue penetration and inability to
reach intracellular targets. Nevertheless, small molecule based PPI inhibitors remain scarce as large PPI
interfaces cannot be efficiently blocked by small molecule drugs. The shortcomings of these two major drug
modalities towards PPI inhibition rekindled people’s interest in peptides as an alternative modality. Peptides, as
a quintessential example of medium-sized molecules, would be able to forge large enough molecular contact to
block a PPI interface. On the other hand, they hold promise to overcome the limitations of antibody drugs,
particularly in terms of oral availability. The enthusiasm in peptide drugs was further fueled by the advent of
genetically encoded screening platforms such as phage display, which enables rapid screening of peptide
libraries. However, phage display often fails to reveal PPI inhibitors of desired potency, presumably due to the
overly simplistic structures of natural peptides in contrast to peptide natural product-based drugs. Over the past
few years, our group have made a number of exciting advances towards expanding the chemical space of phage
display libraries. First, we have developed novel warheads that elicit reversible covalent binding of amines such
as a lysine side chain. Second, we have successfully constructed covalent binding phage libraries and
demonstrated their utility in PPI inhibitor discovery. Third, we have developed highly efficient chemistries for
phage modification to give backbone rigidified peptide macrocycle libraries. These advances pave the road for
the further exploration of phage libraries of complex structured peptides. With this MIRA application, we seek to
develop novel phage libraries that display various covalent warheads and/or backbone rigidifying elements.
These phage libraries will be assessed for PPI inhibitor discovery against a panel of model proteins as well as
proteins that enable bacterial immune evasion or confer antibiotic resistance. Our proposed research will allow,
for the first time, pharmacologic interrogation of host-pathogen PPIs as potential targets of novel antibacterials.
Importantly, the proposed work will yield a powerful platform for discovering non-antibody based PPI inhibitors,
which will have broad impact far beyond the scope of this proposal.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Project Summary
Streptococcus pneumoniae is a leading cause of pneumonia, acute otitis media (ear infection), and
meningitis in the United States. S. pneumoniae remains an important pathogen despite a vaccine and
effective antibiotic treatments due to increasing levels of antibiotic resistance and vaccine evasion
through serotype switching. Virulence in S. pneumoniae is mediated by a complex gene regulatory
program that is only partially understood. In many bacteria, trans-acting small non-coding RNAs
(sRNAs) play key roles in regulating stress and virulence responses. While many sRNAs have been
identified in S. pneumoniae via high-throughput sequencing studies, biological function has been
assigned to only a few. The goal of this exploratory proposal is to identify the mRNA targets for sRNA
candidates in S. pneumoniae, focusing specifically on those implicated in mediating virulence. We have
two aims to reach this goal: First, we will determine the mRNA targets for a set of prioritized sRNA
candidates implicated in S. pneumoniae virulence during mouse infections. Second, we will
characterize the entire S. pneumoniae sRNA:mRNA interaction network. To achieve the first aim, we
will use MS2-afinity purification coupled with RNA sequencing (MAPS) to identify mRNA targets for a
set of prioritized sRNAs associated with fitness defects in mouse infections. MAPS tags each sRNA
individually to allow specific capture of sRNA targets, but allows unbiased identification of potential
mRNA partners via high-throughput sequencing of the captured RNAs. This approach will be combined
with computational tools that predict the targets of sRNAs using thermodynamic properties. A set of 5-
10 of the most promising mRNA targets identified from the combined approaches will be assessed
using reporter gene assays to validate the sRNA impact on gene expression. To achieve the second
aim, we will use RIL-seq, a technique which captures mRNA:sRNA pairing through crosslinking
followed by ligation. Subsequent sequencing identifies chimeric reads corresponding two interacting
RNAs. To enrich for sRNA:mRNA pairs, a FLAG-tagged RNA-binding protein partner to
immunoprecipitated the sRNAs. In S. pneumoniae, which lacks an RNA chaperone, we will use Cbf1,
an exonuclease shown to process sRNAs, to enrich our population. Taken together, our two aims will
identify mRNA targets for sRNA candidates associated with virulence, and move the field from
cataloging sRNA presence toward identification of sRNA biological function, and thus therapeutic
intervention.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
In mammals, insulin primarily regulates metabolism while insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) stimulates growth,
proliferation and differentiation. Aberrant production of IGF-1 is connected with different human diseases
including growth disorders such as Laron syndrome, acromegaly and Graves' orbitopathy as well as thyroid
eye disease (TED) and the early stages of diabetic nephropathy. In addition, circulating levels of IGF-1 are
increased in cancer patients and IGF-1 receptor (IGF1R) expression is upregulated in various tumor types.
Although the IGF1R system plays a key role in tumor progression and has been one of the most intensively
investigated molecular targets in cancer research, previous clinical attempts to develop IGF1R inhibitors have
largely failed. Thus, there is a critical knowledge gap regarding the underlying mechanisms of IGF1R inhibition
and an urgent need to develop novel IGF1R inhibitors. The data generated through my K01 grant has
expanded the family of insulin/IGF-like hormones and provided us a new tool to probe this complex system:
viral insulin/IGF-1-like peptides (VILPs). Previously, we chemically synthesized these VILPs and characterized
their function on the insulin receptor (IR)/IGF1R system using in vitro and in vivo assays. While most of the
VILPs are natural agonists of the IR and IGF1R, we showed that two VILPs in Mandarin fish ranavirus (MFRV)
and Lymphocystis disease virus-1 (LCDV1) are highly specific and potent antagonists of the IGF1R. This
discovery has opened up new avenues for understanding and studying IGF1R inhibition. The overarching goal
of this proposal is to examine unique antagonist effects of MFRV and LCDV VILPs on the IGF1R to elucidate
the underlying structural and molecular mechanisms of the IGF1R inhibition. Our central hypothesis is that the
VILPs will inhibit IGF1R signaling and IGF-1 related proliferation function via their unique interaction with the
IGF1R, differentially regulating post-receptor signaling pathways and IGF1R gene expression. We will test this
hypothesis based on two independent Aims. In Aim 1, we will test the hypothesis that VILPs engage with
human IGF1R in a unique way, recruit different substrates to the receptor and modify post-receptor signaling
while directly regulating IGF1R gene expression. We expect to determine the molecular and structural
mechanisms of the hIGF1R antagonism in vitro. In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that VILPs will specifically
inhibit IGF1R signaling in vivo without affecting IR signaling and decrease IGF-1 mediated growth without
affecting glucose metabolism. These findings will define the effects of VILP-mediated IGF1R inhibition using
two in vivo models of IGF-1 mediated growth and IGF-1 mediated tumor progression. This proposal is built on
the conceptual innovation based on our exciting discovery of the VILPs and their unique effects on IGF1R. We
propose using cutting-edge techniques and if proven right, these studies will transform our understanding of
the IGF1R inhibition and function as a proof-of-principle for the introduction of peptide-based inhibitors of the
IGF1R into the framework of human disease research.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
 Approximately 1 in 3 women and 1 in 5 men over the age of 50 will suffer from a fragility fracture in their
remaining lifetime. Fragility hip fracture is one of the most serious and debilitating outcomes of osteoporosis with
a 20–40% mortality rate during the first year after the fracture. Hip fracture incidence rates are known to increase
exponentially with age in both women and men; and with the rising life expectancy throughout the globe, the
number of men and women who will be above the threshold of fragility fracture is expected to almost double,
with a prediction of 319 million cases by 2040. Thus, the number of fractures is predicted to double as well.
 In this Direct Phase II SBIR, BioSensics, in collaboration with orthopaedic, radiology, endocrinology and
biomechanics experts at Harvard Medical School, proposes to develop a cloud-based software solution for
automatic, opportunistic screening for hip fracture risk using plain X-ray images, called XFx. X-ray studies are
ubiquitous in all corners of the world, are inexpensive and provide high resolution studies that offer insight into
bone geometry, microstructure and density, at a low ionizing radiation dose. The proposed software solution will
include 1) a desktop application for uploading X-ray images and displaying and visualizing XFx results, and 2) a
secure cloud-based backend for receiving the uploaded X-ray images and performing the analysis. The software
architecture will support on-premise integration with a hospital cloud services (e.g., PACS systems) to enable
automatic, opportunistic screening for hip fracture risk using plain X-ray images. The solution will stand by in the
central imaging data server of hospitals or clinics, investigate each non-investigated X-ray image, and if
recognized to include a proximal femur, automatically execute the AI/ML-based classification scheme to identify
patients with osteoporosis or at high risk of hip fracture. If a patient is identified to have osteoporosis or a high
risk of fracture, the software will flag the patient. The clinician providing care for the patient will then be prompted
to consider ordering an evaluation of fragility fracture risk and receive a full report.
 This process is reimbursable under the Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) code 76499 “Unlisted
Diagnostic Radiographic Procedure.” This code is used when no other specific procedure code exists. The
existence of this CPT will support the initial marketing of the proposed solution. In Phase III, we will prepare an
application for a new Category III CPT code and submit if for consideration by the American Medical Association
(AMA) CPT Editorial Panel. Given the clinical need of the proposed solution, and recent approval of a CPT code
for radiology artificial intelligence (code 0691T) for automated analysis of existing imaging studies for vertebral
fracture and bone density assessment, our application for a new CPT code should not face any difficulties. In
the longer term, the proposed imaging analysis technology can be used for automatic analysis of thousands of
medical images that are taken every day in hospitals and clinics. This will enable detection of diseases and
conditions at early stages (e.g., bone metastasis and different tumors), thus facilitating preventive measures and
better care for those individuals at risk.

Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) syndromes span the spectrum of neurodegenerative disorders
affecting movement and cognitive function and are pathologically related to Alzheimer's disease. In this project,
we will develop a robust multi-modal platform for remote monitoring of motor symptoms, speech and cognitive
function in FTLD syndromes using wearable sensors and digitized tests. We will validate this solution in
Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP) by collecting longitudinal data from 60 PSP patients over a period of 12
months. PSP is a severe and rapidly progressive FTLD syndrome that lacks effective treatment and leads to
rapid onset of dementia, disability and death. The rapid progression of PSP will allow us to validate the solution
within the timeline of this Direct Phase II SBIR project and facilitate future studies in FTLD syndromes.
In this Direct Phase II project, we will recruit 60 participants with PSP from 2 leading CurePSP Centers of Care.
These participants will be monitored for 12 months. The sensor data will be collected using PAMSys, a wearable
sensor developed by the support from a NIH STTR grant award. PAMSys is patented (U.S. Patents # 8,206,325,
9,005,141, and 9,901,209), validated and commercialized by BioSensics. The digitized tests will be collected
using BioDigit Home, a unified solution for the collection of digital biomarkers that is currently being used in
several NIH-funded studies and pharma-sponsored clinical trials in neurological disorders. BioSensics has
already customized its BioDigit Home solution to monitor motor, speech and cognitive functions in PSP, and has
carried out a pilot study with 7 PSP patients, who were monitored for up to 3 months using the developed system.
We will collect data from 60 PSP patients in this aim to develop a set of algorithms for monitoring motor, speech
and cognitive function that will enable objective assessment of PSP disease severity and progression, thereby
creating a multi-modal remote monitoring solution for PSP. These tools will accelerate clinical trials that are
focused on the development of novel therapeutics for tauopathies (i.e., FTD, PSP CBS) and can be readily
adapted to many neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease, multiple system atrophy,
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, myotonic dystrophy and stroke.
BioSensics is a 2020 Tibbetts Award winner with a proven track record of rapidly transitioning applied
governmental research funding into real commercial results. The initial market for our technology is
pharmaceutical clinical trials, where BioSensics is a vendor of record of medical-grade wearable sensors and
digital clinical trial technologies for multiple pharmaceutical companies. The current project will significantly
broaden BioSensics' offerings to pharmaceutical companies, specifically by providing a solution for digital
assessments of speech, motor and cognition function, which are relevant to many diseases. This commercial
potential is fully aligned with the latest recommendations from the FDA, NSF and NIH to digitize clinical trials.

Regenerative medicine therapies of various kinds are promising and rapidly growing, both in scale and type.
The therapeutic products are not pills–they are living cells that are harvested from a patient (or sometimes a cell
bank) and are shipped to a pharmaceutical company that modiﬁes the cells and then sends them back to be re-
injected into the patient. Logistics plays an outsize role in this process because the samples need to be
maintained at ultra-low temperatures throughout the shipping process. Because these samples are personalized
to a particular patient, they are not replaceable with something else. If damaged or switched, the outcome will
be dire.
The state-of-the-art shipment technology today is, a dry shipper at liquid nitrogen temperature with a
temperature logger that is physically attached to the dry shipper–but they report the temperature of the shipper,
not the sample so if a sample is removed for inspection, this will not be recorded.
For regenerative medicine therapies to be successful, it is essential that the end-to-end processes of freezing,
storage, and thawing are carried out in strict adherence to precisely deﬁned protocols. Transient warming events
and variability in product temperatures throughout shipping and distribution can negatively affect the samples
and contribute to poor clinical outcomes. Therefore, it is necessary to validate optimized cold chain practices
individually for each sample, to ensure the highest quality therapeutic outcomes.
The goal of this fast-track proposal is to develop a functional pilot product that will provide an on-the-sample,
end to end temperature log before, during, and after shipping. Software will compare user-deﬁned protocol
criteria with the sample temperature record and will provide a go / no-go decision for use of the sample.
The speciﬁc aims of the project are: (a) develop the on-sample electronics that records the temperature history
of the sample along with timestamps with an accuracy of 2 °C, (b) develop the shipper electronics that needs to
operate for 3 days on batteries and record time stamped sample temperatures and transmits that data back to the
sample custodian, and (c) develop a cryogenic container that can keep the sample data acquisition active while
the samples moving around in the lab, and ﬁnally (d) a quality assurance station the can inform the end user if
the sample is viable by checking the sample's temperature record against the criteria set by the protocols for that
sample.

 The interstitial lung diseases (ILD) are a major source of respiratory morbidity, and as a group are the
leading indication for lung transplantation worldwide. Two particularly devastating ILD complications are
progressive lung fibrosis (Progressive ILD) and ILD-related pulmonary hypertension (ILD-PH). While effective
treatments are now available for both types of complications, there is a critical need to identify at-risk patients
before complications have already occurred and treatments become less effective.
 A known feature of pulmonary vascular disease is relative loss of the smaller vessels, referred to as
“pruning,” and vascular abnormalities are linked to both Progressive ILD and ILD-PH. Using advanced image
analysis of computed tomography (CT) scans, pruning can be quantified using existing imaging data – since
virtually all patients with ILD undergo CT scanning at the time of diagnosis, this could potentially lead to
widespread improvements in ILD risk stratification.
 The key focus of this project is to determine if pruning on CT can identify those at risk for Progressive
ILD and ILD-PH. This study will use both existing data from a cohort of highly characterized patients with ILD
from a sub-specialty clinic, and will also recruit a new prospective cohort to collect follow-up data related to ILD
outcomes. This proposal will combine advanced quantitative image analysis tools, rigorous epidemiologic
methods, and a comprehensive set of ILD-related outcome measures, including lung function testing, CT
imaging, exercise testing, survey scores, hemodynamic assessment, and review of clinical outcomes such as
hospitalization and death. The results of this study will help determine if CT pruning is a non-invasive marker of
high-risk ILD – which may potentially facilitate earlier and better treatment of ILD complications, thus
preventing morbidity and contributing to better long-term health for people with ILD.
 During this project, the candidate will develop advanced proficiency with quantitative vascular image
analysis techniques, learn critical new methodological skills, and obtain hands-on experience in the design and
execution of prospective studies. The candidate will be mentored by an outstanding, multidisciplinary team of
experts who will provide rigorous training, complemented by formal coursework, and personalized career
development support. The project takes place within an exceptional and unique institutional environment, and
leverages resources from the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Chan School of Public Health,
Applied Chest Imaging Laboratory at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, and Harvard Catalyst. The data, training,
and career development opportunities provided by this award will position the candidate to be a leader and
independent investigator in the application of chest imaging tools that will inform and improve the clinical care
of individuals with chronic lung disease.

Our research proposes to elucidate local and systemic immune dysregulation in rosacea with the long-term goals
of developing novel preventative and therapeutic targets and improving overall health outcomes for rosacea
patients. Rosacea is a common inflammatory skin disease with unclear etiology affecting over 14 million people
in the United States alone.1 Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) is a microbe-sensing mechanism that maintains immune
homeostasis in the skin through communication with commensal microbes.2-4 Therefore, we suspect that
understanding the skin microbiota-host interaction is critical to elucidating the pathogenesis of rosacea. Moreover,
the immune dysregulation in rosacea does not appear to be localized to the skin. There is a growing body of
epidemiological evidence demonstrating that rosacea is associated with a wide range of systemic co-
morbidities.40-51 Thus, it is also important to elucidate potential systemic immune dysregulation that can explain
the overall disease burden in rosacea patients. Aim 1: We aim to test the hypothesis that skin dysbiosis induces
transcription and expression of the components of the innate immune response implicated in the pathogenesis
of rosacea. To that end, we will perform multi-omics data integration of the microbiome, transcriptome, and
proteome from rosacea skin in order to delineate the microbiota-host interaction. Aim 2: We aim to test the
hypothesis that there is shared immune dysregulation between the skin and systemic circulation that can explain
the burden of systemic co-morbidities in rosacea patients. To that end, we will perform multi-omics data
integration of the transcriptome and proteome from the skin and blood/serum in order to characterize shared
molecular pathways. Dr. McGee’s career goal is to become a physician scientist with the unique expertise to
apply multi-omics, data-driven, personalized strategies to treat inflammatory skin diseases and their associated
systemic co-morbidities. To achieve this goal, she will undertake a combination of formalized coursework,
workshops, and hands-on training in bioinformatics, computational biology, human subjects research, and
clinical trials. She will also engage in career development activities by participating in a grant writing course and
a K-R transition program. Dr. McGee’s research and career development will be guided by a mentoring team
with several decades of combined experience in successfully transitioning their mentees to research
independence. Dr. McGee’s training will take place at two prominent academic institutions: 1) Beth Israel
Deaconess Medical Center, a major teaching hospital of Harvard Medical School which supports ~250 principal
investigators and offers 16 institutional and 12 departmental core facilities, and 2) Harvard T.H. Chan School of
Public Health, which hosts the consistently ranked #1 biostatistics program in the country and supports
computational research initiatives to answer multidisciplinary questions.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Older adults in America are living longer, and there are more of them than at any other time in the country’s
history. U.S. adults aged 65 and older are expected to increase from 54 million in 2020 to over 80 million by
2040. Older adults are at risk for poor health in many areas of life, including physical, mental, social, and
financial health. They want to age successfully as they seek information from their health care providers and
publicly available sources. Over 40% of adults use the internet for health information, although there is mistrust
and confusion because the availability of information is generic and scattered through many different
resources. For this Fast Track SBIR project, we propose the Adult Wellbeing Checkup (AWC) - an innovative
and informative assessment and recommendation tool that will help older adults assess their wellbeing in
twelve different domains and then receive personalized guidance (based on a collectively intelligent hybrid
reasoning methodology) on how to improve wellbeing in domains that were low-scoring and want to improve.
AWC will be designed and developed by BellAge, led by Principal Investigator (PI), James Firman, in
collaboration with Yong Choi and Stephen Engels, and supported by Benten Technologies. The specific aims of
Phase I are: 1) Develop a prototype of the AWC with personalized recommendations in two of the twelve
domains from formative research; 2) Conduct a 4-week pilot with 8 older adult care partners (CPs) and 8 older
adult non-CPs from three senior centers to assess feasibility (engagement, usability, and acceptance). The
specific aims of Phase II are to 1) Modify the AWC prototype for commercialization and provide personalized
recommendations for more wellbeing domains, and 2) Conduct a randomized control trial (RCT) with 25 older
adult CPs and 25 older adult non-CPs in eight research sites examining three of the twelve domains (i.e.,
loneliness, physical health, mental health) to significantly improve engagement, self-efficacy, and wellbeing on
one or more domains.
The short-term impact will be the feasibility, acceptance, and engagement of older adults with the AWC
platform. Then, in Phase II, if successful, this study will demonstrate the development and implementation of
personalized guidance can result in behavior change among older adults. Furthermore, the assessment could
improve wellbeing measurement for state-funded programs and organizations, allowing longitudinal data
collection to prompt future funding and development. For future research, we would further develop the
platform to provide personalized recommendations for the remaining nine domains. Ultimately, this service
could be a guidance system and preventative care intervention for many aspects of life for older adults.

A prothrombotic vessel wall is implicated as a major driver of cardiovascular disease, including heart attacks,
strokes, and venous thromboembolism. Despite extensive research into the mechanisms of endothelial cell
dysfunction, the fundamental question of how a clot forms in blood vessels remains incompletely understood.
Activation of blood coagulation enzymes requires a membrane surface containing anionic phospholipids, most
notably phosphatidylserine (PS). PS-binding proteins decrease thrombosis in animal models suggesting that
targeting PS exposure may be a novel antithrombotic strategy. Plasma membrane PS is normally sequestered
on the inner membrane leaflet. To activate blood coagulation, PS must be externalized to the outside of the cell
by calcium-activated phospholipid scramblases. Platelets readily externalize PS in vitro, and it has often been
assumed, but not clearly demonstrated, that platelets generate the procoagulant PS to promote thrombosis in
vivo. Our data demonstrate that (1) the majority of PS externalization in vivo actually derives from the vessel
wall, independent of platelets, and (2) inhibiting TMEM16 phospholipid scramblases decreases the thrombotic
potential of the vessel wall. We have identified two TMEM16 family members, TMEM16F, and its closest
paralog TMEM16E, that are both required for PS externalization and procoagulant activity in endothelial cells.
TMEM16E is not found in platelets and previously has no known role in coagulation. The central hypothesis of
this application is that the endothelial cell membrane is the primary source of PS in forming a thrombus, and its
externalization is regulated by two scramblases, TMEM16E and TMEM16F. In Aim 1 we will determine the
mechanism by which both TMEM16E and TMEM16F promote PS externalization and procoagulant activity in
endothelial cells. In Aim 2 we will use mouse models and intravital microscopy to determine the contribution of
endothelial cell-derived PS to thrombosis and how it is regulated by TMEM16E and TMEM16F in vivo.
 This proposal describes a five-year research training program for Dr. Alec Schmaier’s mentored career
development. The applicant has a strong research background in platelet activation from the Medical Scientist
Training Program at the University of Pennsylvania. This proposal expands his skill set through investigations
in endothelial cell biology, blood coagulation and vessel wall thrombosis. Dr. Robert Flaumenhaft in the
Division of Hemostasis and Thrombosis at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center will be the primary research
mentor. Dr. Flaumenhaft has a distinguished record of mentorship and innovation in thrombosis research. In
addition, the applicant’s advisory committee will provide highly relevant scientific expertise and critical
assessment of his progress. In sum, Dr. Schmaier has created an outstanding environment to advance his
research and career goals to be a physician-scientist in cardiovascular medicine. This comprehensive training
program will position him to succeed as an independent investigator in thrombosis and vascular biology.

Primary cilia function is essential for the development of normal left-right asymmetry, kidneys, heart, central
nervous system and many other organs. Current data indicate that the cilium functions as a signal transduction
organelle, compartmentalizing receptor-, adaptor- and downstream transduction mechanisms for multiple
signaling pathways. However, the identity of essential cilia signals and how signals are transduced by the
cilium remains unclear. A complex of four ciliary proteins, inversin, NEK8, ANKS6 and nephrocystin-3
constitutes the so-called ciliary inversin compartment (IC), localized in the proximal portion of the ciliary shaft.
We and others found that the IC is required for cilium function in vertebrates, with mutations in INVS, NEK8,
ANKS6 and NPHP3 all leading to ciliopathy syndromes that include L-/R-asymmetry perturbation, congenital
heart defects and polycystic kidneys. These defects phenocopy the full knockout of PKD2, one of the two
major autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease genes, suggesting that signaling downstream of ADPKD-
and IC-gene products occurs along the same pathway. We found that IC proteins also control ciliary length and
intraflagellar transport (IFT) velocity, processes that require cAMP signaling. Unexpectedly, we find that
nephrocystin-3 acts as a novel GTPase, suggesting a causal link between IC- and cAMP-signaling. In this
grant proposal, we aim to investigate the functional significance of the nephrocystin-3 GTPase mechanism,
defining the catalytic parameters of the enzyme, and interrogating molecular connections among the IC
constituents and to upstream- and downstream signaling factors.
We hypothesize that nephrocystin-3 acts analogous to a stimulatory heterotrimeric G-protein α-subunit,
switching its activity state off and on, along a GTP-hydrolysis cycle. In Aim #1, we will investigate nucleotide
affinitiy and -turnover of the purified recombinant nephrocystin-3, along with the pcy allele that affects the
catalytic site, and that gives rise to polycystic kidney disease in mice; compared to GαS. We will test, whether
ciliary G-protein coupled receptors may utilize nephrocystin-3 as a signal adaptor, and whether adenylyl
cyclases may be stimulated by nephrocystin-3, to generate cAMP. In Aim #2, we investigate the molecular
details of the IC assembly hierarchy. We seek to identify what protein domains are necessary to recruit
nephrocystin-3 to its proper localization, to maintain the integrity of the whole complex, and if disease-causing
mutations destabilize the structure. We will ultimately measure ciliary cAMP levels, as a function of IC
manipulations, and test whether deletion or mutation of individual IC proteins change ciliary cAMP levels.
These studies connect ciliopathy gene function to cAMP signaling, thereby addressing outstanding issues in
ciliary biology with important implications for cystic kidney disease pathogenesis. The results will help
identifying druggable enzymatic targets within the IC that may lead to the design of novel therapies.

Recent evidence suggests that up to 10% of patients with Pancreatic Ductal AdenoCarcinoma (PDAC) harbor
a germline genetic mutation in a cancer risk gene. For this reason, the National Comprehensive Cancer
Network (NCCN) and American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) recommend germline genetic testing for
all patients with PDAC. However, the best ways to perform this testing and use the resulting information
remain unclear. As genetic testing becomes more common, critical questions need to be addressed: the
number of genes to test; whether testing causes patient distress; and the benefit of PDAC screening in healthy
mutation carriers. Answering these questions will maximize the benefit of genetic testing while minimizing the
risks of over-testing, over-screening, and inefficient use of resources.
My goal is to reduce the burden of pancreatic cancer by identifying optimal ways to execute germline genetic
testing in patients with PDAC and act on the information gained. To accomplish this goal, I will develop a
mathematical model that simulates patient genetic testing and resulting treatment selection, as well as family
member notification, genetic testing, and PDAC screening (Aim 1). I will conduct patient surveys to expand our
understanding of patient distress associated with genetic testing and communication of results to family
members (Aim 2.1). I will use the model and insights gained to determine the timing and breadth of genetic
testing that will optimize life expectancy for patients and family members (Aim 2.2). Finally, I will conduct a
cost-effectiveness analysis of germline genetic testing in PDAC that takes into account diagnosis, treatment,
and family genetic testing in an innovative structure (Aim 3). This will allow me to identify effective and high-
value genetic testing strategies for patients with PDAC, including benefits to patients and their family members.
Completion of this project will be a critical step towards my goal of becoming an independent clinician-scientist
focused in disease modeling, genetic testing, and cancer outcomes research. In addition to my ongoing role
as a clinician and teacher, I will undertake an educational program that has been specifically designed to
support this project and my career goals. I have assembled a mentorship team with unique strengths in cancer
modeling, cancer genetics, and pancreatic cancer research, all of whom are strong, independent investigators
who can guide my career development. This award will provide critical support to allow me to broaden my
knowledge base, leverage the expertise of a senior mentorship team, secure independent R01 funding, and
support my transition to independence in the years to come.

biomarkers and their association with health and disease. Dr. Cruz’s research interests primarily focus on
historically understudied groups and understanding how varied genetic ancestry plays a role in disease
pathogenesis. African Americans suffer disproportionately from many chronic diseases and in particular
cardiovascular disease. African Americans have also not been included in many cardiovascular studies, raising
the possibility that some results may not be applicable to them. Compounding these issues is the fact that
traditional genetic analyses are not designed to account for the relatively complex genetic makeup that African
Americans have, due to their African ancestry and admixture with other populations. This project aims to
identify the circulating metabolites that are associated with coronary heart disease, investigate the portions of
the genome that are of African continental origin, and use this correlation to identify specific genes that are
associated both with African ancestry and coronary heart disease. Through intensive laboratory and didactic
training in metabolomics and genetics, Dr. Cruz will harness the resources of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical
Center, Harvard Medical School, and associated institutions to examine a disease of significant societal
impact. Situated in a multi-disciplinary laboratory, Dr. Cruz will take advantage of novel metabolomic
technologies and novel genetic analytical strategies to better decipher how genetic ancestry influences levels
of circulating metabolites. He will use admixture mapping techniques, which take into account the
heterogeneous genomic make up of African Americans, to better understand how the unique genomic
structure of recently admixed populations may influence baseline circulating levels of metabolites. Using
plasma samples from African American participants of the Jackson Heart Study and Multi-Ethnic Study of
Atherosclerosis, metabolomics will be used to measure levels of circulating metabolites and assess which
metabolites are associated with incident coronary heart disease, with over 15 years of follow up. Clinical traits
associated with coronary heart disease like, diabetes, hypertension, obesity, and hyperlipidemia will also be
analyzed. Using admixture mapping, regions of potential association between the metabolites of interest and
African ancestry in the genome will be identified, allowing for higher power in identifying specific associated
variants in those regions. As precision medicine offers the promise of more personalized care, it is incumbent
on the biomedical research community to take into account the unique genetic makeup of all members of
society. This project aims to offer specific pathophysiologic information for a historically understudied group of
people. Ultimately Dr. Cruz intends on using his research efforts to provide better medical care to understudied
and underserved populations, and in turn improve the health of society as a whole.

Adipose tissue is a central player in energy balance and glucose homeostasis, it is able to expand in the face of
caloric overload in order to store energy safely, but it can become overloaded and dysfunctional, leading to
systemic metabolic compromise in the form of insulin resistance and Type 2 diabetes. To investigate differences
in individual cell types in lean and obese individuals, I have performed single nucleus RNA sequencing (sNuc-
seq) on human subcutaneous and visceral white adipose tissue and created an atlas of cell types present in
white adipose tissue. A major finding from this work was the identification of distinct subpopulations of
adipocytes, some of which are associated with body mass index (BMI). By associating our data with genome-
wide association studies (GWAS) for metabolic traits such as T2D, we additionally predict that some adipocyte
subpopulations are associated with metabolic disease. The objective of this project is to identify factors that
predispose one subpopulation over another, both externally as well as transcriptionally. To do this I will perform
sNuc-seq on adipose tissue collected from subjects during and post-bariatric surgery in order to characterize the
change in adipocyte subpopulation during weight loss. I will next interrogate the chromatin state of adipocyte
subpoulations by performing the Assay for Transposase Accessible Chromatin on single nuclei from adipose
tissue of lean and obese individuals. Finally, I will directly test potential signaling and transcriptional regulators
of subpopulation identity by performing a screen of potential signaling regulators as well as a CRISPRa screen
of potential transcriptional regulators to try to recapitulate distinct subpopulations in vitro. The experience that I
have in characterizing adipose tissue at single cell resolution, as well as the experience of my mentor and co-
mentor in studying transcriptional and genetic regulation of adipocytes make me uniquely positioned to answer
these questions. Taken together, these studies will enhance our knowledge of human white adipocyte diversity
and will set the stage for downstream studies in my own independent lab and in the community at large.

 Interoception, the sensing of signals from internal organs, is crucial to achieving homeostasis in
unpredictable environments. For instance, appropriate food intake relies on accurate estimation of future
energy balance, which in turn relies on gastrointestinal (GI) signals like nutrient content or stomach stretch. A
key brain area that assesses visceral state is the lateral parabrachial nucleus (LPBN) in the brainstem. Visceral
information is routed to the LPBN by several convergent pathways, including the nucleus of the solitary tract
(NTS), which relays signals from vagal afferents to LPBN. Despite this anatomical roadmap, we lack a
comprehensive picture of the functional architecture and GI sensory preferences in the LPBN and its NTS
inputs. This information is crucial to understanding how representations of body signals associated
with fasted, fed, and feeding states are formed, and how they regulate energy balance. To address this
gap in knowledge, I propose to assess the functional organization of GI representations and their relation to
natural feeding. I will further test if specific NTS cell types mediate the relay of these visceral signals to the
LPBN. I will accomplish these aims with a novel method of two-photon imaging in the hindbrain that tracks
hundreds of LPBN neurons across days. In Aim 1, I will measure visceral sensory preferences in the LPBN in
response to mechanical stimulation and nutrient delivery across regions of the GI tract. These measurements
will allow me to determine the spatial organization of LPBN, including testing the presence of a viscerotopic
map of internal organs. Next, I will relate these recordings to activity in the LPBN during ingestion, visceral
malaise, and across fasted and fed states. I will test the hypothesis that a wave of neural activation in LPBN
across many seconds during natural feeding tracks a putative map of the GI tract. In Aim 2, I will determine
how specific inputs from the NTS contribute to feeding-related and satiety state-related activity in LPBN.
Specifically, I will repeat the stimuli of Aim 1 while recording from calcitonin receptor-expressing (Calcr)
neurons of the NTS that have been shown to signal physiological satiety. I will measure when individual axons
of these inputs to LPBN (CalcrNTS->PBN) are active, as well as record LPBN responses to the above stimuli while
CalcrNTS->PBN axons are silenced. These experiments will demonstrate how a key pathway relays GI state and
other satiety information to the LPBN to regulate behavior and interoception. The proposed research will lay
the groundwork for understanding how interoceptive signals from the GI tract lead to satiety sensations,
influence feeding behaviors, and ultimately regulate energy balance. This knowledge will pave the way for
future efforts combining in vivo imaging with spatial transcriptomics to identify specific cell types and
subregions within the LPBN as therapeutic targets for obesity and other metabolic disorders.

The proposed study is a five-year career development research plan that focuses on dissecting the epigenetic

Stanford University and Byers Eye Institute, and Dr. Jason Buenrostro at Harvard Stem Cell and Regenerative
Biology (SCRB) Department and Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard. The candidate has also recruited Dr. Daniel
Geschwind, a collaborator of his current and proposed studies, as his advisor for specific scientific and technical
support. The proposed experiments and training activities will enable the candidate to publish top-tier
ophthalmology research works and uniquely position him as an independent principal investigator pursuing novel
therapeutics for retinal disease such as glaucoma.
Glaucoma is the second leading cause of blindness in the United States with at least 3,000,000 people affected.
This number is likely to increase by 60% by 2030 if no new therapeutics could be developped. Due to the inablity
of central nervous system to regenerate after injury, the vision loss resulted from RGC death is irreversible and
will lead to permanent blindness. Our preliminary experiments using the CRISPR/Cas9-based in vivo forward
genetic screen have discovered that the knockdown of injury induced epigenetic regulators, such as CCCTC-
binding factor (CTCF), can robustly promote RGC axonal regeneration or/and survival. To explore the underlying
epigenetic mechanisms regulating RGC survival and regeneration, the proposed study will specifically pursue
the following aims: (1) To profile injury-induced chromatin remodeling in RGCs by ATAC sequencing (mentored
phase); (2) To assess the mechanisms that mediate differential effects of survival and regeneration regulators
upon injury (mentored and independent phase); and (3) To assess the mechanisms and effects of epigenetic
regulators in a glaucoma model (independent phase). For the past two years during this K99 award, I have
successfully accomplished all experiments and goals in Aim 1 and Aim2, with two manuscripts published on
Neuron in 2022 (and selected as cover story). For the extended period of my K award, I will further pursue the
translational study of my approaches in glaucoma relevant mouse models. The outcome of the proposed study
will provide in-depth and quantitative insights into why and how the regenerative fates of RGCs are pre-
determined from an epigenomic perspective, which can be directly transformed to new cures for optic
neuropathies.

Psychotic disorders including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and related illnesses are severe, debilitating, and
often fatal. Cognitive impairments in psychosis are among the leading predictors of disability and poor quality
of life; despite this, there are no first line interventions to target these symptoms. Neuroimaging correlates of
cognitive impairment in psychosis have been identified using fMRI techniques; however, these studies are
mostly correlational in nature, limiting application of these findings to intervention. In order to develop targeted
cognitive interventions, there is an urgent need to 1) identify neural circuits that are causally linked to cognitive
function, and 2) demonstrate that circuits are modifiable and that circuit-level change is associated with
cognitive change. This project is a renewal of a R01 funded multi-year, multi-PI plan to identify the circuit basis
of medication refractory symptoms of psychotic disorders. With NIMH support we found that cerebellar-cortical
functional connectivity is linked to both psychotic symptoms (hallucinations) and negative symptoms of
schizophrenia. Functional connectivity can be engaged and manipulated non-invasively using neuromodulation
techniques such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). The combination of TMS and longitudinal imaging
can help establish causal links between circuits and cognition. In the current project we have identified distinct
cortical-cerebellar circuits linked to cognitive deficits in psychosis and its prodrome. We replicated this finding
and have pilot data that this circuit can be successfully engaged using rTMS. Thus, the goals of this project are
1) to test whether neural circuit dysfunction is dynamically and causally associated with cognitive impairments
in people with psychotic disorders, and 2) to test whether TMS drives dynamic change in both neural circuitry
and cognitive performance. We hypothesize that the relationship between circuit connectivity and cognition
reflects dynamic states intra-individually and over time. Additionally, we hypothesize that the connectivity state
of this circuit is modifiable by TMS and that circuit manipulation will result in cognitive change. The PIs have
expertise in cognition and imaging in psychosis and the fMRI-guided TMS protocols proposed here, including
successful engagement of cerebellar-cortical targets, as well as access to the equipment and resources
necessary to carry out the study. If our hypotheses are supported, we will have identified an actionable target
that can be immediately deployed in intervention trials to test the potential for fMRI-guided TMS to drive
enduring change in cognitive circuitry and performance in psychosis.

During the initial funding period, we applied aptamer-based proteomic analysis (SomaLogic) to investigate
cardiometabolic disease among African Americans (AAs) in the Jackson Heart Study (JHS). In published studies,
we identified novel biomarkers that are associated with the development of left ventricular hypertrophy, CHF and
with CKD over a decade before the onset of clinical disease, including plasma proteins that are differentially
associated with outcomes in individuals of predominantly African vs. European ancestry. We also described how
whole genome sequence analysis of the plasma proteome in individuals with African ancestry increases our
power to detect novel genetic determinants. In addition to identifying over 100 new locus-protein associations,
the associations suggest new mechanisms of genetically mediated diseases linked to African ancestry. We
identified a novel association between variants in APOL1 and the protein CKAP2, as well as an association
between ATTR amyloidosis and RBP4 levels in community dwelling individuals without CHF.
In unpublished work, we have also identified novel determinants of incident CHD, including Secreted
Transmembrane Protein 1 (SECTM1), a poorly characterized protein with potential chemotactic activity for
monocytes. In follow-up in silico analyses, SNPs associated with circulating SECTM1 levels are also associated
with the monocyte percentage of white blood cells in large human databases. Further, our pilot experiments in
mice demonstrate that short term administration of recombinant SECTM1a (mouse homologue) increases pro-
atherogenic and inflammatory Ly6Chi circulating monocytes, as well as monocyte progenitors in the bone
marrow. These data suggest that SECTM1 may be a novel regulator of monocyte biology that contributes to
CHD. More broadly, we have shown that large-scale proteomic profiling in well-characterized populations can
identify proteins and pathways that may be causal for adverse cardiometabolic conditions.
In this renewal, we will first extend our discovery efforts of novel biomarkers of incident CHD and its risk factors
using the recently expanded, highly specific Olink 3,000-plex platform (Aim 1), which includes >2100 proteins
that have not been assayed in a large number of AAs. In Aim 2, fine mapping of protein-associated genetic
variants, co-localization studies with established CHD-associated variants, and Mendelian Randomization
experiments will be used to assess causality of protein-associated variants for CHD, CKD, and other
cardiometabolic conditions. For both Aims 1 & 2, findings will be replicated in a multi-ethnic population (MESA),
and extended through multi-omic analyses involving extensive metabolomic data available in both JHS and
MESA. Putative causal variants that emerge from these analyses will be validated in model systems in Aim 3,
with initial studies focusing on SECTM1’s atherogenic potential in mouse models. In addition to SECTM1, we
anticipate follow-up investigations of two other proteins highlighted by our discovery work. All data from this multi-
institutional collaboration will be made publicly available in real time for the entire scientific community.

SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assays, one of the two major testing modalities used for diagnosis of COVID-19, are
inherently quantitative. This has led to use of cycle threshold values for determining (a) if a tested individual
remains infectious; (b) whether therapeutic approaches are working in immunocompromised patients; (c)
whether a specific illness is more or less likely to be a result of SARS-CoV-2 infection or some other cause; and
(d) whether a positive PCR test represents a current infection or prolonged detection of residual SARS-CoV-2
RNA that may linger for months after an original infection. Cycle threshold (Ct) values are the first cycle during
PCR amplification during which fluorescence signal crosses a reliable instrument detection threshold.
Unfortunately, Ct values are both assay and instrument specific. In fact, for any given Ct value, viral loads (the
amount of virus in a nasal or nasopharyngeal sample) may vary over one thousand-fold depending on the testing
platform. Traditionally, quantitative PCR assays are calibrated with standards which allow conversion of a test
method-dependent Ct value to a test method-independent viral load. The latter directly reflects the amount of
virus in a sample. Therefore, there is strong impetus to develop calibrators covering the billion-fold range of viral
loads observed in COVID-19 infected individuals. Furthermore, these calibrators should be inexpensive and
accessible to diagnostic and research laboratories. However, currently available calibration standards are very
expensive, available in small quantities, labile, and/or do not reflect the higher viral load levels that identify
infectious individuals and signify ongoing infection in immunocompromised patients. Therefore, here we propose
to develop calibrators that address these needs. We identified the positive-strand RNA Qb bacteriophage as a
compelling vector in which to clone SARS-CoV-2 PCR target sequence for calibrator development. Importantly,
as an encapsidated single-strand RNA calibrator, such Qb derivatives will be able to assess inefficiencies in
extraction, reverse transcription, and amplification phases of PCR tests; are inherently stable; and can be grown
to high titers that encompass the upper range of viral loads observed in specimens. The proposal will examine
the ability of the Qb to tolerate heterologous SARS-CoV-2 PCR target sequence inserted into Qb A1 and RNA-
dependent RNA polymerase genes with or without complementation of phage functionality in trans. Lastly, we
will validate calibrators through interrogation of two major commercial platform diagnostic SARS-CoV-2 PCR
assays, and, as proof-of-principle, use these calibrators as a tool to establish their comparative analytical
measurement range and limit of detection. Taken together, we will establish a new set of inexpensive, readily
available reagents for use by the clinical and scientific community to enhance standardization and rigor of data
available from SARS-CoV-2 PCR diagnostics.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress play key roles in Parkinson’s disease (PD). PGC-1α is a master
regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis and antioxidant defenses. PGC-1α deficiency plays a key role in
dopaminergic (DA) neuronal survival, including vulnerability to α-synuclein (αSyn) toxicity, and also potentially in
Alzheimer’s disease. However, viral vector mediated overexpression of PGC-1α at high levels causes DA
neurons to degenerate and increases susceptibility to MPTP toxicity. Thus, harnessing the therapeutic potential
of PGC-1α likely requires normalization (or only mild elevation) of its expression levels in neurons. Achieving this
requires a better understanding of mechanisms regulating PGC-1α. We hypothesize that chaperone-mediated
autophagy (CMA) regulates PGC-1α indirectly by regulating FBW7, a multi-subunit E3 ubiquitin ligase that
promotes the degradation of critical regulatory proteins, including PGC-1α. We have found that SCFFBW7 harbors
the perfect CMA consensus sequence, “KFERQ”, and that increasing CMA decreases FBW7 and increases
PGC-1α protein levels. We hypothesize that CMA degrades FBW7, thus reducing UPS-mediated degradation of
PGC-1α:
↑CMA  ↓ FBW7  ↑ PGC-1α
. FBW7 is a target of PRKN, with Prkn loss leading to increased FBW7
in Prkn-null mice, which in turn reduces levels of the anti-apoptotic factor Mcl-1. Furthermore, brain FBW7 levels
are increased in PD patients with PRKN mutations. Thus, FBW7 is a potential therapeutic target in PD, but our
understanding of mechanisms regulating FBW7 is limited. To this end, we have preliminary data implicating that
p300/SIRT1 dependent regulation of FBW7 acetylation plays a potentially key role in regulating FBW7 levels.
p300/SIRT1 also interact directly with PGC-1α, and thus may represent a homeostatic mechanism for
maintaining stable levels of PGC-1α activity. We now propose first to analyze molecular mechanisms that
regulate FBW7 and PGC-1α, and then will specifically test our hypothesis that reducing SCFFBW7 in DA neurons
will protect against αSyn toxicity in a mouse model of PD.

The Na+/K+/2Cl- co-transporter (NKCC2) is the main sodium transporter in the medullary thick ascending limb
(mTAL), and enhanced activity of NKCC2 has been linked to hypertension in animal models and humans. We
recently found mutant ACTN4—a cytoskeletal protein previously known to contribute to human podocyte
dysfunction and glomerular disease—leads to salt sensitive hypertension in a novel rat model. ACTN4 is
expressed in mTAL, and we found in our new adaptation of organ-on-chip technology, mTAL-on-chips, that
mutant ACTN4 contributes to increased sodium uptake within mTAL cells via enhancing NKCC2 activity. Our
long-term goal is to define the role of ACTN4 in regulating sodium homeostasis and blood pressure salt
sensitivity. The overall objective of this application is to determine the degree to which disease-causing mutant
ACTN4 influences sodium handling in mTAL. Our central hypothesis is that mutant ACTN4 alters the F-actin
cytoskeletal network, which in turn disrupts normal trafficking of NKCC2 within mTAL cells. This disruption of
trafficking leads to accumulation of NKCC2 on the apical membrane of mTAL cells, elevated sodium reabsorption
in mTAL, and ultimately salt-sensitive hypertension. Aim 1 will determine the degree to which mutant ACTN4
increases salt-sensitivity in mTAL cells. We will use mTAL-on-chips seeded with wild type (WT) mTAL cells and
mutant ACTN4 mTAL cells. We will measure sodium reabsorption of mTAL cells in response to varying levels of
stress, including increasing sodium concentration, shear stress, and stretch. Aim 2 will elucidate the mechanism
by which mutant ACTN4 disrupts NKCC2 trafficking. We will measure differences between WT mTAL and mutant
ACTN4 mTAL cells in (1) the cell surface NKCC2 levels and (2) NKCC2 trafficking (endocytosis and exocytosis).
We will further measure whether these differences are amplified in response to varying levels of stress. Aim 3
will ascertain whether in vivo salt-sensitive hypertension associated with mutant ACTN4 is mediated by NKCC2.
We will examine the effect of mutant ACTN4 on pressure natriuresis. We will also assess the effect of inhibiting
NKCC2 with furosemide on acute natriuresis and blood pressure salt-sensitivity. The research proposed in this
application is innovative in that it integrates the novel mTAL-on-chip technology with advanced imaging and
whole animal physiologic studies to comprehensively delineate the mechanism by which mutant ACTN4 leads
to salt-sensitive hypertension. This research will provide strong evidence of a novel and essential mechanism of
sodium and blood pressure regulation performed by the cytoskeletal protein ACTN4.

 Recent innovations by project investigators have established an important new framework for sustaining
the anti-thrombotic properties of blood contacting films in order to improve the clinical performance of a variety of
implanted cardiovascular devices. Notably, we have discovered highly active, orthogonal sortase mutants that
recognize unique peptide sorting motifs, enabling repeated covalent assembly and disassembly of surface
bound biomolecular constituents, thereby providing a means to regenerate anti-thrombotic constituents on blood
contacting films after device implantation. While precedent exists for the therapeutic use of foreign proteins,
recent innovations by project collaborators have also led to the development of novel computational and
experimental tools for protein deimmunization to mitigate any immunogenic risk that may be associated with
sortase-derived enzymes. Importantly, we have also developed new chemoenzymatic schemes leading to the
discovery of a synthetic heparin that is resistant to heparanase mediated biodegradation, forming the basis of a
novel family of highly durable heparin thin films. These breakthroughs offer an opportunity to extend the lifetime
of a bioactive film with commensurate improvements in clinical outcomes. In this proposal we intend to:
(1) Design synthetic heparins that are resistant to heparanase and characterize their capacity to limit
thrombus formation as a component of a ‘rechargeable’ thin film. Chemoenzymatic and orthogonal ligation
schemes will be used to generate synthetic heparins that are resistant to heparanase mediated biodegradation.
In addition to characterizing the biostability of these new heparin analogues, anticoagulant activity will be
determined, and pharmacokinetic properties defined. The rechargeability of thin films comprised of synthetic
heparin analogues will be evaluated in vitro and after extended blood-contacting periods in vivo.
(2) Design functionally deimmunized sortase variants to facilitate in situ recharging of bioactive thin
films through deletion of immunogenic T cell epitopes. The cellular immunogenicity of a pentamutant
sortase variant, eSrtALPETG, will be assessed and T cell epitopes driving the response mapped in naïve human
peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Computational tools will be used to design functionally deimmunized
candidate eSrtALPETG variants, which will be evaluated for their maintenance of transpeptidation activity and their
reduction of cellular immunogenicity. Lead candidates will be assessed in humanized HLA transgenic mice.
(3) Synthesize and characterize blood contacting thin films that enable selective and repetitive
regeneration of multiple bioactive constituents that inhibit thrombin generation. In the first phase of these
investigations, we plan to define the capacity of deimmunized sortase variants to facilitate the fabrication of
rechargeable, multicomponent bioactive thin films that contain both synthetic heparin and recombinant
thrombomodulin. During the second phase, we will define the ability of an anti-thrombogenic thin film containing
multiple rechargeable bioactive constituents to extend the patency of a small diameter vascular graft.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Abstract: The L-type voltage-gated calcium channel Cav1.2 is responsible for the excitation-contraction
coupling of bladder smooth muscle (BSM), making it an attractive drug target for the treatment of lower urinary
tract symptoms (LUTS). Nifedipine, a Cav1.2 antagonist, inhibits BSM contraction. However, trials of nifedipine
and other calcium channel blockers (CCBs) for LUTS patients were unsuccessful. On the contrary,
cardiologists and epidemiologists have consistently reported that intake of CCBs like nifedipine causes higher
voiding frequency and worsen the severity of LUTS in patients. The mechanism of this mystery has never been
answered, which hampers its application as a useful drug target for LUTS treatment. We have discovered that
ketamine functions as a Cav1.2 antagonist to cause ketamine cystitis - a painful bladder syndrome presenting
as frequency, small voids, and incontinence. We have discovered that intravesical infusion of nifedipine or
ketamine directly induces voiding frequency in mice. Conversely, Cav1.2 agonist induces fewer but larger
voids, suggesting Cav1.2 agonists as potential novel therapeutics for LUTS. In addition to BSM, we have
further discovered the presence of Cav1.2 in urothelium, and urothelial specific deletion of Cav1.2 (UCav1.2-/-)
in mice results in dramatic voiding frequency, small bladder capacity, and diminished voiding efficiency, a
phenotype closely resembles that produced by intravesical infusion of nifedipine in mice, and the symptoms of
patients with ketamine cystitis or CCB users, indicating a crucial role of Cav1.2 in urothelial function and
bladder pathology. We propose that disruption of Cav1.2 signaling causes deficient urothelial exocytosis and
reduced bladder capacity, which leads to abnormal mechanosensation by elevated ATP signaling and result in
voiding frequency. We will test our hypothesis by the following two aims: Aim 1. We will define bladder storage
abnormality in UCav1.2-/- mice by studying Cav1.2 regulated umbrella cell (UC) exocytosis. We will use
videocystometry and electrophysiology to determine UC exocytosis and bladder urodynamics, and test its
Cav1.2- and AC-cAMP-PKA- dependence. We will further manipulate Cav1.2 expression by gene silence or
knockin specifically in UCs, to determine whether it can rescue the voiding abnormalities observed in UCav1.2-
/- mice or induces a phenotype resembling UCav1.2-/- in wild type mice. Aim 2. We will define urothelial
mechanosensory/voiding abnormality in UCav1.2-/- mice. We will test whether mechanosensation is altered in
UCav1.2-/- mice by abnormal urothelial ATP signaling. We will further test whether elevated urothelial ATP
signaling by ablation of ATP hydrolase Entpd3 in urothelium leads to voiding frequency as proposed in
UCav1.2-/- mice. In brief, our data indicate a crucial role of Cav1.2 in regulating bladder storage and voiding
function, supporting a novel mechanism on urothelial Cav1.2-mediated exocytosis and ATP signaling. A
complete understanding of this mechanism should answer the longstanding question of why Cav1.2
antagonists are of no benefit for LUTS patients, and potentially leads to novel therapeutics for LUTS treatment.

While cancer cachexia is a devastating syndrome characterized by progressive muscle wasting, inflammation,
and metabolic disruption, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly characterized. There are currently no
treatments for cachexia. Cancer cachexia is driven by systemic inflammation, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and
apoptosis (“cellular debris”). A paradigm shift is emerging in understanding the resolution of inflammation as an
active biochemical process with our discovery of novel specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs), such as
resolvins and endogenous resolution programs. SPMs stimulate macrophage-mediated clearance of debris,
promote tissue/muscle regeneration, and counter-regulate pro-inflammatory cytokines at nanogram doses
without immunosuppression. Despite approaches to block systemic inflammation, there are no current “pro-
resolving” therapies in cancer or cancer cachexia. Moreover, the impact of cancer cachexia on eicosanoids
and the novel pro-resolving lipid mediators, both key endogenous regulators of initiation and resolution of
inflammation, are unknown. This proposal builds on our recent finding that stimulating resolution of inflamma-
tion prevents tumor growth by counter-regulating pro-inflammatory cytokines/eicosanoids and clearing debris.
Therefore, the overarching theme is to elucidate the underlying processes of failed resolution of inflamma-
tion that drive cancer cachexia. We will rely on a set of established experimental systems, including genetic
and pharmacological manipulation of SPMs and their receptors in animal models and macrophages. We shall
test this in a multi-pronged approach. In Specific Aim 1, the mechanisms of dysregulated resolution of in-
flammation in cachexia will be investigated. We will profile lipid autacoid mediators, including eicosanoids and
SPMs, to test our innovative hypothesis that failed resolution of inflammation is necessary and sufficient
to cause cachexia, which induces a rapid eicosanoid storm with dysregulated SPMs that leads to an un-
controlled cytokine storm. We will evaluate pro-resolving lipid mediators as interventional targets in ca-
chexia. In Specific Aim 2, we will optimize the delivery of SPM mimetics and humanized nano-pro-
resolving medicines (NPRMs) carrying SPM cargo to cachectic tissues and determine whether SPMs can
prevent chemotherapy-induced cachexia. These studies will complement Specific Aim 3, which seeks to pre-
vent cancer cachexia via stimulation of resolution by precision nutrition. Parabiosis studies will determine
whether cancer-induced cachexia is caused by an effect on the primary tumor or the metastatic site as most
patients with cachexia die from metastases. These studies can offer a new animal system to evaluate cachexia
at an early stage. We will connect our preclinical findings to clinical disease phenotypes using a computational
framework to understand failed inflammation resolution in cachexia. Since SPMs have proven safe and effec-
tive in human inflammatory disorders, these studies shall provide the basis for rapid translation of resolution-
directed treatments in humans as a new direction to potentially prevent and/or reverse cancer cachexia.

By age 75, individuals sleep about 1.5 hr. less per night, take longer to fall asleep, wake up more frequently at
night and are more likely to nap during the day than at age 25. Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease/Lewy
body dementia, and fronto-temporal lobe dementia exacerbate these problems. We hypothesize that the
changes in wake-sleep and circadian behavior during aging are due to subclinical neurodegeneration
of wake-sleep and circadian circuitry as a continuous process during aging. This would be similar to
REM sleep behavior disorder, which often occurs 10-15 years before a diagnosable synucleinopathy. We
further hypothesize that different neurodegenerative disorders may affect different patterns of wake-
sleep and circadian cell groups and cause different behavioral changes. If this hypothesis is correct, it
may be possible to use specific sleep and circadian disturbances as biomarkers to identify early, preclinical
stages of these disorders. We propose here to test these hypotheses using two unique sets of subjects from
the Rush Memory and Aging cohorts, who have actigraphic recording of rest-activity behaviors. In the first set
of subjects, who have had actigraphy within one year of death and a brain autopsy, we will analyze the
actigraphy for sleep time, sleep fragmentation, and sleep efficiency during the night, nap time during the day,
and circadian activity phase and amplitude. We expect to find that cell loss will be associated with
deposition of pathological proteins in wake-sleep and circadian cell groups, and specific patterns of
wake-sleep and circadian behavioral deficits, even if there was no diagnosable neurodegenerative
disorder during life. In Aim 1, we will look at wake-promoting (orexin, tuberomammillary, A10, raphe,
pedunculopontine, parabrachial, and locus coeruleus), sleep promoting (ventrolateral preoptic, MCH), and
circadian (suprachiasmatic vasopressin and VIP neurons) cell groups for association between deposition of
neurodegenerative pathological protein deposits (beta-amyloid, phospho-tau, phospho-α-synuclein, phospho-
TDP-43) and reduced numbers of surviving neurons. In Aim 2, we will look for association of changes in sleep
time, efficiency, fragmentation, and napping, as well as changes in circadian amplitude or phase with numbers
of remaining neurons and deposition of neurodegenerative proteins in the same cell groups as Aim 1. In Aim
3, we will test a separate validation cohort of patients who had actigraphy 2 or more years prior to death and
clinical and pathological diagnosis at the time of death, to determine whether specific wake-sleep or circadian
deficits predict later neurodegenerative diagnoses. We hope to be able to identify patterns of wake-sleep
and circadian deficits during life using actigraphy, an inexpensive, non-invasive, and widely available
tool, that predict and act as biomarkers for subclinical presence of Alzheimer’s disease and other
neurodegenerative disorders, similar to the relationship of REM sleep behavior disorder and
synucleinopathies.

Little is known about the pathogenesis of lupus nephritis (LN), particularly as it relates to the initiation and
propagation of the inflammatory response which accounts for the development or end stage renal disease. LN
may complicate up to two thirds of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus with higher rates commonly
seen among minorities and children. Besides the needle kidney biopsy, we lack tools that reflect tissue
pathology with fidelity. Although two drugs have been recently approved to treat patients with LN, all treatment
protocols involve systemic administration of drugs or biologics which are laden with side effects and limited
clinical efficacy. Ample evidence has revealed that kidney resident cells and newly formed high endothelial
venules in the presence of an autoinflammatory environment, upregulate molecules which account for the
ensuing inflammation and cell damage, while in their absence, kidney damage is averted. These molecular
changes can be recorded in parallel in podocytes and tubular epithelial cells in the urine. This proposal will
test the hypothesis that interaction of constituents of the immune system with kidney resident cells and the
ectopically formed high endothelial venules, determines the development of inflammation and injury in the
setting of LN. Corollaries of this hypothesis are that kidney resident cells can serve as gateways for the
administration of targeted therapeutics for the treatment of LN and that kidney tissue pathology can be
recorded with high fidelity in the urine cells of patients with LN. There are 2 projects in this proposal: 1)
Interplay between autoimmune effectors and kidney resident cells in lupus nephritis and 2) Newly formed high
endothelial cells in the kidney- pathogenesis and implications in lupus nephritis. The proposal will be supported
by 3 cores: The Administrative Core will be responsible for regulatory compliance, budget management,
scheduling meetings. The Nanoparticle Immune Delivery Core will be responsible for the construction of
nanoparticles loaded with drugs and biologics and tagged with antibodies for cell-specific delivery. The Single
Cell, Spatial Transcriptomics and Bioinformatics Core will perform single cell transcriptomics studies and will
provide statistical and bioinformatics support. This proposal through extensive synergistic plans between the
project leaders brings forward novel and significant elements in the study of the pathogenesis, treatment and
biomarker development in patients with LN.

Tight regulation of circulating nutrients within a narrow physiological range is a critical function of metabolism,
and eating is a regular perturbation of this homeostasis. Growing evidence suggests that changes in circulating
metabolites after a standardized mixed meal tolerance test (MMTT) may reflect underlying cardiometabolic
(CM) health beyond what is revealed during fasting. Thus far, there have been very few broad
characterizations of metabolomic changes after a standardized meal in a large cohort of community-dwelling
individuals with a range of CM risk. In recently published human data, the applicant identified >30 circulating
metabolites whose 2-hour changes after a MMTT are different in people with diabetes vs. those without even
after accounting for fasting differences. A subset of these metabolites is associated with premature death in a
large population-based cohort. The applicant will now extend these pilot findings in the Framingham Heart
Study (FHS), where >2,400 participants will undergo a MMTT and metabolomic profiling of ≈800 targeted
metabolites and ≈5,000 unknown compounds by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. We will
test whether specific metabolites’ responses after a MMTT are associated with a range of CM risk factors such
as insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, obesity, and unhealthy diet, and novel glycemic traits by continuous
glucose monitoring (Aim 1). We will then assess broader epidemiologic implications of these post-MMTT
metabolite responses by examining their associations with incident cardiometabolic disease (CMD) in the FHS,
relating their fasting levels to incident diabetes and cardiovascular disease (CVD) in racially and ethnically
diverse external cohorts, and testing whether post-MMTT metabolite responses may be causally related to
CMD by leveraging genetics (Aim 2). Finally, we will translate the paradigm of using a MMTT to assess CM
health from individuals in the community with average CM risk to a hospital-based cohort of individuals with
overt CMD (i.e., heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [HFpEF]). We will assess whether post-MMTT
metabolite responses are related to markers of HFpEF disease status and if post-MMTT metabolite responses
improve after treatment with sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors, which are theorized to improve
outcomes in HFpEF through metabolic modulation (Aim 3). The applicant is an early career investigator and
cardiologist with a research focus on leveraging evolving biochemical profiling techniques in precision nutrition
to improve CVD prevention and treatment. This proposal will further the applicant’s career development
through training in nutrition science, state-of-the-art metabolomics technology, advanced biostatistics and
bioinformatics methods for analyzing metabolomics and genomics data, and the conduct of patient-oriented
research in diverse settings. The applicant’s outstanding mentoring team of senior investigators with
distinguished mentoring records and internationally recognized expertise in nutrition, metabolomics, genetics,
and epidemiology will support the candidate as he transitions to research independence during the award.

Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) decreases mortality and both CR and pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) improve
function, quality of life, and decrease readmission rates. Despite their proven efficacy, both programs are
grossly underutilized, with fewer than 20% of eligible persons participating. Patients with heart and lung
disease living in rural communities have even lower rates of participation.
The objective of this proposal is to test the feasibility of performing a full-scale randomized controlled trial
(RCT) to compare the effectiveness and value of a stepped care (SC) model versus treatment as usual (TAU)
in older frail adults living rural counties. TAU refers to center-based rehabilitation (CBR). The SC model
includes initial enrollment into CBR followed by possible step up to three interventions based on prespecified
non-response criteria: 1) Transportation-subsidized CBR, 2) Home-based telerehabilitation (TR), and 3)
Community health worker-(CHW) supported home-based TR. Unlike traditional SC models, the initial treatment
in this model, i.e. CBR, is not the least resource intensive. CBR was chosen as the initial option because it is
currently considered the standard of care.
We will conduct a parallel, 2-arm, randomized controlled feasibility trial. Eligible participants will be randomized
to TAU (CBR) or SC. Because of the urgent need to address underuse of both CR and PR in rural regions, the
proposed feasibility trial will enroll patients referred to either CR or PR. Both arms include an in-person intake
evaluation conducted by a certified rehabilitation nurse in the rehabilitation center to determine exercise
tolerance and design a tailored 8-week rehabilitation program. Patients randomized to TAU participate in two
weekly sessions at the center and are encouraged to exercise at home in between sessions. Patients
randomized to the SC arm will also be enrolled in the CBR program. Those who meet prespecified non-
response criteria will be stepped up to transportation-subsidized CBR. Providing transportation may not be
sufficient for frail older adults who are reluctant to leave their homes in the winter, unfamiliar with exercising, or
do not want to exercise in a group setting. Thus, non-responders, will be stepped up to home-based TR.
Home-based rehabilitation will be supported by Chanl Health, a virtual platform that supports education and
self-management, remote monitoring, and coaching by rehabilitation specialists. Non-responders will be
stepped up to CHW-supported home-based TR. The CHW will be help participants use the mobile app, access
educational materials, clarify educational content, and exercise during biweekly in-person visits.
If the feasibility trial is successful, we will proceed to conduct a parallel, 2-arm, single blind, multi-site
superiority RCT to compare the effectiveness and value (cost-effectiveness) of SC versus TAU (CBR) in older
frail adults living rural counties. Our long-term objective is to provide hospital systems with high quality
evidence on how best to optimize uptake of CR and PR for older frail adults living in rural communities.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
Tobacco use remains the leading cause of death in the United States and contributes to more than 7 million
hospitalizations annually. Hospitalization offers a critical window for intervention: hospital policies prohibit
smoking, patients are highly motivated to quit, and societal guidelines recommend that clinicians should
counsel patients and prescribe smoking cessation pharmacotherapy (SCP) to virtually all smokers.
Nevertheless, only 22% of patients are ever prescribed SCP while hospitalized and only 1% of patients are
prescribed guideline-concordant SCP. This failure ultimately contributes to a 70-80% smoking relapse rate,
most of which occurs within a few days of hospital discharge – well before outpatient follow-up can occur.
 If we are to capitalize on the opportunity that hospitalization provides to maximize smoking cessation
treatment and outcomes, new strategies are needed to overcome the low uptake of guideline-concordant SCP
by physicians and patients. To address this problem, we propose to deploy a nurse practitioner-led, hospital-
based tobacco treatment team to: 1) prescribe individually tailored and guideline-concordant SCP; 2) counsel
and motivate patients to use SCP properly; and 3) and manage a mobile phone-based text-messaging system
to keep patients motivated and adherent to SCP. Our preliminary data suggest that such an approach is
feasible and acceptable to patients, physicians, and hospital administrators.
 In Aim 1, we will perform a parallel-group implementation-effectiveness randomized trial among 424
hospitalized smokers with a cardiopulmonary disease in a large tertiary hospital. We will compare rates of SCP
use and smoking cessation between patients who received the intervention and those who did not. In Aim 2,
we will measure the economic value of the intervention from both a hospital and payer perspective to better
inform hospital and insurance policies and sustainability. In Aim 3, we will perform qualitative interviews with
patients, physicians, staff members, and hospital administrators to evaluate the acceptability and sustainability
of our strategies. We hypothesize that our intervention will: improve guideline-concordant SCP use; increase 6-
month smoking cessation rates; be acceptable to patients, clinicians, and administrators; and be cost-effective
and sustainable.
 Our multi-disciplinary team has broad experience in cardiopulmonary medicine, tobacco treatment,
implementation science, medication adherence, qualitative methods, health economics, and text message
technology. At the conclusion of this grant, our team will develop a detailed, evidence-informed implementation
guide for a hospital-based tobacco treatment team. Ultimately, we anticipate the knowledge gained from this
study will facilitate widespread and effective hospital-based tobacco treatment so that more patients lead lives
free from tobacco and cardiopulmonary disease.

The ability to time underlies adaptive behavior. Precise motor behavior is carefully timed.
Decisions about whether or not to take an action depend on knowledge of when they are
appropriate. Memories for how long actions usually take underlies most ordinary activity such as
planning a day or knowing how long it takes to cross a street. This learning of time is automatic
and a foundation of behavioral organization. Disordered timing and deficits in the capacity to
anticipate predictable events are associated with a number of psychiatric disorders including
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, schizophrenia and depression. The diminished capacity
to anticipate future consequences also play a role in substance abuse disorders. Distortions in
timing and anticipation are both a symptom of the disorders as well as a source of additional
problems.
The purpose of this research is to understand how times are learned, remembered and used to
guide behavior. We explore the psychological and biological mechanisms that govern both
when we make a response at the right time and those that govern our ability to withhold a
response when it is the wrong time. These processes are studied in animal models that allow us
to observe and alter the functioning of the cortico-striatal-thalamo-cortical brain circuits that
underlie these capacities. In particular, we are interested in how dopamine signaling in these
circuits conveys information about time. For the first time we will study how dopamine signals to
the cortex convey information about whether and when an event will occur. We will also test the
hypothesis that the dopamine also conveys information about the reliability of that information.
Understanding these basic mechanisms will lead to new treatment strategies and targets for a
wide range of psychiatric disorders and human problems.

The ability to coordinate or match drug addiction scientists with business, regulatory, and financing experts
(referred to as ‘entrepreneurial leaders’) is key to establishing societal and commercial solutions in this subject
area. Having a database to search for specific characteristics or knowledge, and a platform to identify and
introduce potential partners in is expected to lead to longer associations and startup success. SUD companies
may require some different skill sets, e.g., public health’s focus on the social determinants of health, or public
finance and non-profit management, and thus finding a way to match academic researchers with entrepreneurial
leaders interested in startups that tackle drug addiction is key to establishing successful ventures.
We will also generate and track possible measures of success including networking metrics and publish findings
on these associated metrics. Again, with specific reference to SUD ventures, we will hypothesize metrics that
may be associated with success and publish the empirical data found to be most important for startup success
in drug addiction.

in life in patients over 65 years of age, so called late-onset or sporadic AD. The World Alzheimer’s Report
projects that AD related dementia will rise to 76 million cases by 2030 and 132 million cases by 2050. In the
US alone it is estimated that in 2018, Alzheimer’s and other dementias cost the nation $277 billion. By 2050,
costs could rise as high as $1.1 trillion. Novel therapeutics that prevented or even slowed AD progression
would be of immense economic importance and benefit a huge, and growing, number of patients and their
families. Atux Iskay LLC proposes to develop a novel class of compounds as AD therapeutics that act by
increasing, and normalizing, abnormally suppressed protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) activity in AD, and
thereby directly target the underlying pathology of the disease. Atux Iskay LLC proposes to develop lead
compounds that bind and allosterically activate PP2A, thereby suppressing tau phosphorylation, amyloidogenic
APP processing and neuroinflammation associated with established disease. The lead compound is orally
bioavailable and partitions into the CNS after oral dose. Prototype compounds are active in cellular models of
tau-phosphorylation and Ab secretion, show neuroprotective effects in ex vivo electrophysiology models of
synaptic plasticity and are active in an in vivo rat model of AD where they ameliorate tau and Ab pathologies
and rescue behavioral and cognitive deficits induced in the disease model. The objectives of the project are
 Aim 1. Synthetic and process chemistry on pyran sulfonamide lead. A. Scale-up and resolution
(into (+)- and (-)-enantiomers) of lead compound, ATUX-5800, for pilot toxicology and efficacy studies. B.
Synthetic route scouting for GMP process synthesis of resolved ATUX-5800. Aim 2. Pilot safety assessment
on resolved enantiomer of ATUX-5800. A. Rat PK on resolved isomers of ATUX-5800. B. In vitro, off target,
profile on resolved isomers of ATUX-5800. C In vitro safety assessment on (+)-ATUX-5800 or (-)-ATUX-5800.
D. In vivo (rat) pilot toxicology on (+) or (-)-ATUX-5800. Aim 3. In vivo efficacy on (+) or (-)-ATUX-5800 in
5xFAD transgenic mouse model and assessment of neuroinflammation. Aim 4. Structural biology and
back-up medicinal chemistry. A. Novel modifications of ATUX-5800 structural type. B. Medicinal chemistry
to identify development candidate from ATUX-6156 (sulfonyl urea) structural type. C. Structural biology to
obtain PP2A (A and AC) with bound lead activators ((+) and (-)-ATUX-5800) and back-ups.
 Successful completion of the Phase 2 SBIR Aims will position a lead compound for GMP synthesis and
IND enabling GLP toxicology. The overall objective are new, first in class, disease modifying AD therapeutics
that will benefit AD patients and reduce the enormous and growing burden of Alzheimer’s Disease Related
Dementia.

Ascribe Bioscience is developing a novel technology to prevent foodborne outbreaks caused by the
consumption of edible sprouts. Sprouts are highly vulnerable to infection with human enteric bacterial
pathogens at the seed stage. These pathogens then grow exponentially in the warm and humid conditions used
for sprouting. Even low initial bacterial counts on seeds can result in unsafe microbial loads by the end of sprout
production and processing. Moreover, the internalization of contaminating bacteria into seed tissues
contaminates the sprout tissues from inside, rendering the application of antimicrobials largely ineffective.
Sprouts have emerged as a significant source of foodborne illness and have become a public health hazard.
Between 1996 and 2017, the U.S. experienced 58 foodborne illness outbreaks associated with sprouts,
encompassing at least 1,953 illnesses, 212 hospitalizations, and 5 deaths. According to the FDA, no single
treatment so far has been shown to eliminate pathogens on seeds or sprouts that cause foodborne
illness. Ascribe Bioscience will use a natural, microbiome-derived molecule that activates and/or prime plant
defenses at the seed stage, thereby conferring to sprouts an enhanced resistance against contamination by
disease-causing bacterial pathogens. Ascribe's proposed treatment technology has the potential to
dramatically improve the safety of edible sprouts by addressing both external and internal bacterial
contamination. In Phase I, Ascribe has established the feasibility of the technology for the prevention of outbreaks
related to human consumption of sprouts by demonstrating that treatment with our molecule can prevent
Salmonella growth during the sprouting process in alfalfa. In Phase II, we will finalize the sprout seed treatment
formulation and expand testing to a broader spectrum of sprout-pathogen systems. To support
commercialization, we will perform toxicity and residue testing for regulatory approval, and refine synthesis
methodologies to enable large-scale production of the active ingredient. The specific aims of this Phase II project
are 1) Refine treatment formulation, including optimized formulation development, determination of the minimum
effective dose and treatment duration, comparison of the effectiveness of the formulation versus the sprout
industry-standard treatments, and measuring the effects of the formulation on germination, growth and sprout
quality; 2) Test the efficacy of treatments against other illness-causing pathogens on a variety of sprout types,
and evaluate it's role in altering bacterial abilities to form biofilm; 3) Demonstrate safety via toxicology studies
and residue testing to support EPA approval; 4) Develop methods to scale the synthesis of active ingredient to
pilot scale, and 5) Investigate the ability of the molecule to provide post-harvest protection to leafy greens. The
proposed research is expected to yield commercial products that will prevent or dramatically reduce the
incidence of sprout-related foodborne outbreaks.

High-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC) is a devastating disease responsible for the deaths of ~125,000
women worldwide each year. HGSOC has the lowest survival rates. More than 20% of HGSOCs harbor genetic
mutations (e.g. BRCA1/2MUT) that cause defects in homologous recombination (HR), which causes sensitivity
to PARPi. However, responses to PARPi are rarely durable and resistance is acquired rapidly. Another 50% of
HGSOCs do not harbor defects in HR and instead overexpress Cyclin E (CCNE1) through amplification, copy
number gain, or transcriptional means. Unlike BRCA1/BRCA2-mutant tumors, which initially respond to platinum-
based chemotherapy, CCNE1-amplified tumors are associated with primary platinum failure. A recent study
revealed that 1) Cyclin E (CCNE1) induction increases ATR signaling and sensitivity to WEE1 kinase inhibitor
and ATR inhibitor (WEE1i-ATRi) treatment, 2) WEE1i-ATRi increases tumor regression in a CCNE1-level-
dependent manner in PDXs, 3) Differential molecular effects of WEE1i and ATRi promote replication fork
collapse, and 4) CCNE1 amplification is a reliable biomarker predictive of response to WEE1i-ATRi. These
findings indicated that a combination of WEE1 kinase inhibitor (WEE1i) and ATR inhibitor (ATRi) is a feasible
approach for the treatment of PARPi-resistant Cyclin E (CCNE1) overexpressing (CCNE1HIGH) high-grade serous
ovarian cancer (HGSOC). These results provide a strong rationale for Atrin to develop a first-in-class combination
of WEE1i and ATRi that can allow lower-dosing strategies to mitigate off-target toxicity for the treatment of
HGSOCs. Atrin Pharmaceuticals, Inc has been in the field of DDR for over a decade and is pioneering the
development of next-generation, selective ATRi. We have discovered ATRN-119 as a highly selective ATRi and
have received FDA IND approval (IND #141317). In parallel, we have also discovered a highly selective WEE1
inhibitor demonstrating high potency on WEE1 kinase, superior selectivity over PLK1, and significant anti-growth
activity against various cancer cell lines of NCI-60 panel with high potency. In addition, our WEE1i exhibits
superior potency in OVCAR8 cells compared to AZD1775. Pharmacokinetic (PK) study in mice shows superior
oral bioavailability compared to AZD1775. In an OVCAR-3 xenograft tumor model, it alone completely halts tumor
growth without causing loss of body weight. Importantly, our WEE1i sensitizes the ovarian cancer cell line
(OVCAR8) to ATRN-119. Given these promising results, we proposed to 1) Quantify sensitivity of HGSOC to our
WEE1i and ATRN-119 alone as well the combination in PDX models of HGSOC. 2) Identify additional biomarkers
to expand target patient populations, 3) Evaluate the toxicity, and 4) Obtain a GMP batch of API. The success
of our Direct-to-Phase II project will further support chemistry, manufacturing, and controls (CMC) to manufacture
clinical supply of our novel WEE1i and complete FDA-required IND-enabling pharmacology safety and toxicology
studies. In addition, findings from this project will inform clinical trial protocols using our first-in-class combination
for the treatment of HGSOC, which critically needs more efficacious treatments.

COVID-19, the multiorgan disease caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, has become the most
impactful healthcare, social, and economic crisis of our lifetime. SARS-CoV-2 is genetically related to the
previous two coronaviruses that caused human outbreaks in the 21st century, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Even
though COVID-19 mortality is lower than the other two coronavirus diseases, the pandemic has impacted, by
mid-April 2022, >500 million people worldwide, and caused >6 million deaths. Had the COVID-19 mortality been
closer to those of SARS and MERS, the impact of the current pandemic would be incomparably more
catastrophic. The need for cold storage, the requirement for boosters, and the potential for adverse allergic
reactions, are major drawbacks of current COVID-19 vaccines.
To address these shortcomings, we propose to generate a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine that is stable at room
temperature, requires only one injection, thus being more practical to deploy nationally and globally during
vaccination campaigns, and is less prone to cause hypersensitivity reactions. We plan to conduct this Proof-of-
Concept study over a 24-month period with a multidisciplinary team of engineers, molecular virologists, and
immunologists. Our overarching goal is to double nanoencapsulate the mRNA molecule that encodes the
coronavirus Spike protein in phospholipid nanosomes and then into biodegradable polymer nanospheres to
sustain mRNA release. We will characterize the antigenicity and integrity of the nanoencapsulated mRNA before
and after nanoencapsulation and coating and determine the best process conditions that ensure stability at room
temperature after lyophilization. We will also evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, and immunogenicity of the
nanoencapsulated antigen and perform challenge studies in two animal models, in anticipation of subsequent
clinical studies. Based on these studies, we will select the best nanoformulation for scale-up, more detailed
characterization, establish potency and release specifications, and regulatory studies in Phase II.

Approximately 38 million people worldwide are living with HIV. Despite antiretroviral therapy (ART), 15-40% of
people with HIV (PWH) develop HIV-associated neurocognitive impairments (HIV-NCI). HIV enters the brain
early, often before people are aware of their HIV status or diagnosed. One mechanism for CNS infection is the
transmigration of HIV-infected intermediate CD14+CD16+ monocytes across the blood-brain barrier (BBB).
CD14+CD16+, or mature monocytes are increased in the blood of PWH, are the most susceptible to HIV infection,
and preferentially transmigrate across the BBB. This transmigration across the BBB contributes to the
establishment and reseeding of CNS viral reservoirs and chronic neuroinflammation that results in a neurotoxic
environment and neuronal injury that mediates HIV-NCI development. Therefore, characterizing mature
monocytes is critical to understanding the mechanisms by which they contribute to the pathogenesis of
inflammatory diseases in the presence of HIV, and to define ways to block their pathological effects. To
characterize functional properties of mature monocytes and the effects of HIV infection in these cells, we
previously performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of uninfected and HIV-infected mature
monocytes. This study showed that both populations separated into 9 monocyte clusters. Expression of genes
from molecular pathways involved in migratory, inflammatory, or neurotoxic functions in each cluster compared
to other clusters revealed two groups of monocyte clusters in both uninfected and HIV-infected cells, with
increased expression of most genes in these pathways in one cluster group (Group 1) compared to the other
(Group 2). Whether this difference in gene expression indicates increased transmigratory, inflammatory, and
neurotoxic properties of monocytes in clusters from Group 1 compared to those from Group 2 is unknown. We
hypothesize that uninfected and HIV-infected mature monocytes in Group 1 clusters express high levels of genes
in migratory and inflammatory functions, they preferentially transmigrate across the BBB to CCL2, and produce
more inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and ROS that contribute to HIV neuropathogenesis than Group 2
monocyte clusters. Aim 1: Characterize the transcriptome of Group 1 and Group 2 mature monocyte clusters to
identify mechanisms of their contributions to increased inflammation and BBB transmigration. We will validate
that group 1 clusters show increased median fluorescence intensity of proteins that correlate with genes
expressed in Group 1 monocyte clusters by flow cytometry, and confirm expression of these genes by qRT-PCR.
Aim 2: Characterize BBB transmigration and inflammatory properties of Group 1 compared to Group 2 mature
monocyte clusters. We will determine functional properties of Group 1 monocyte clusters by determining ROS,
cytokine, and chemokine production by flow cytometry, transmigration propensity with our in vitro BBB model,
and blocking antibodies targeting Group 1 proteins to see if transmigration is inhibited. scRNA-seq will also be
performed on transmigrated cells to better characterize and define Group 1 and Group 2 monocyte clusters.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：SUMMARY
Tuberculosis (TB) remains a global epidemic, with one-fourth of the current world population infected and
approximately 10 million new active cases annually. However, our knowledge about the causative agent,
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), is still limited, and the only licensed TB vaccine (BCG) is inadequate to
control the epidemic. It is critical to better understand the biological difference between Mtb and BCG in order
to develop a more effective TB vaccine. Our long-term goal of this project is to develop a novel
recombinant BCG vaccine to better control TB. Recently, cyclic di-AMP (c-di-AMP) has been recognized as
a new bacterial signaling molecule and a potent vaccine adjuvant. We have demonstrated that Mtb Rv3586
(disA) encodes a diadenylate cyclase and Rv2837c (cnpB) encodes a c-di-AMP phosphodiesterase.
Compared to the Mtb wild-type (WT), ∆cnpB secretes a significantly larger amount of c-di-AMP and stimulates
a stronger type I interferon (IFN-I) response in the infected macrophages. We have also revealed that BCG
∆cnpB produces but does not secrete c-di-AMP; both c-di-AMP secretion and Mtb region of difference 1 (RD1)
are required for the c-di-AMP-induced IFN-I response. Interestingly, it is well known that BCG is defective in
inducing IFN-I, and addition of IFN-I enhances BCG's immunogenicity. Moreover, c-di-AMP has been utilized
as a potential vaccine adjuvant that elicits strong humoral and cellular immune response. Overproduction of c-
di-AMP in BCG by expressing disA also results in better protection in infected animals. However, the
improvement is moderate likely because that the recombinant BCG is still unable to secrete c-di-AMP and
induce substantial IFN-I. Therefore, we hypothesize that manipulation of c-di-AMP homeostasis and secretion
in BCG will enable BCG to provide a better protection against TB. The objective of this application is to
construct a recombinant BCG that secretes c-di-AMP and induces optimal levels of IFN-I response during
vaccination. We propose two specific aims: (1) to construct c-di-AMP-secreting recombinant BCG strains, and
(2) to evaluate the recombinant BCG strains in induction of IFN-I and protection against Mtb infection. These
recombinant BCG strains will be very likely superior to the current BCG in vaccine efficacy. Furthermore, our
findings will also provide fundamental insights into vaccine strategies for other bacterial pathogens. Thus, this
proposal has a broad impact on public health.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Epileptogenesis is a pathological process that transforms a normal brain into an epileptic brain, typically
initiated by genetic mutations and neurological insults such as status epilepticus (SE). There is an unmet need
to understand epileptogenesis because it remains nearly unpreventable. Brain inflammation triggered by
neuronal injury is increasingly recognized as a contributor to epileptogenesis. Microglia, generally considered
as resident macrophages, are highly proliferated and activated in response to epileptogenic insults and thought
to play a primary role. Besides resident microglia, other immune cells in the peripheral system and CNS
lymphatic system also infiltrate the CNS compartment and likely contribute to epileptogenesis. It remains to be
understood how CNS resident and non-resident immune cells interact in response to epileptogenic insults and
how the injury-triggered changes in the immune network impinge on non-immune cells such as astrocytes and
neurons, thereby contributing to epileptogenesis. This proposal is built on our observation that IL22Rα1 is
strongly up-regulated in astrocytes in the pilocarpine model of temporal lobe epilepsy. This induction depends
on brain inflammation. Moreover, the induction of IL22Rα1 is critically involved in astrogliosis, an excessive
proliferation and activation of astrocytes frequently seen in epileptic brains. These findings lead to our central
hypothesis, that up-regulation of IL22/IL22Rα1 signaling promotes astrocyte proliferation, which in turn
contributes to epileptogenesis. Three specific aims are proposed to test our hypothesis. Aim 1 will determine
how IL22Rα1 expression is up-regulated in astrocytes. Aim 2 will elucidate how IL22-producing immune cells
are recruited into the CNS compartment. Aim 3 will determine if blocking IL22 signaling attenuates astrogliosis
and modifies the process of epileptogenesis. Our study will not only improve our understanding how IL22
signaling regulates epileptogenesis, but could also identify druggable targets to prevent epileptogenesis.

develop locomotor muscle dysfunction, which is associated with worse clinical outcomes including higher
mortality. Retention of CO2 in the blood, or hypercapnia, is also frequent in these patients and similarly associated
with higher mortality. The mechanisms that regulate these processes are currently unknown, and the available
treatments have no effects on survival in this setting. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms controlling CO2-
retaining COPD-driven muscle dysfunction could help develop strategies to prevent and reverse that, with
potentially survival and quality of life benefits for these patients. Muscle dysfunction in COPD is associated with
abnormal protein turnover and metabolism. The present application proposes to investigate the contribution of
dysregulated cellular metabolism to the pathophysiology of CO2-retaining COPD. The hypothesis that supports
this application is that succinate dehydrogenase (SDH)/complex-II subunit-C downregulation represents a
fundamental event in COPD-driven skeletal muscle dysfunction, causing reduced ATP-generation and higher
fatigability; and that hypercapnia attenuates this process via LKB1-AMPK-driven mitochondrial biogenesis. To
investigate that hypothesis, the first aim is dedicated to studying the role of SDHC downregulation in COPD
myopathy using an animal model of COPD-driven skeletal muscle dysfunction we recently published. Genetic
restitution of SDHC will allow gain-of-function to address the mechanisms leading to metabolic dysfunction in
COPD muscles. The second aim of the proposal will investigate the specific mechanisms that regulate CO2-
driven dysfunctional metabolism. As LKB1/AMPK controls CO2 sensing and protein turnover in skeletal muscle,
hypercapnia’s effect on metabolism will be investigated with LKB1 knockout cells and animals exposed to
elevated CO2. We will then blend COPD and CO2 on a single model and perform loss of function with a double
transgenic animal. This research represents a substantive departure from the status quo by focusing on the
contribution of metabolism to the long-term effects of COPD-driven muscle dysfunction, and specifically by
identifying SDHC and AMPK as major players COPD muscle respiration and function.

We propose that early endosomes function as a nexus between mitochondria and plasma membrane to
regulate a wide variety of cellular processes including receptor-mediated endosomal trafficking, signaling and
iron homeostasis. Determining how endosomal alterations on a subcellular level affect specific cancer-related
cellular processes, such as cell proliferation, migration and invasiveness is the focus of this research proposal.
Here, we will test the hypothesis that alterations in the early endosomal pathway can modify receptor-mediated
signaling as well as iron cellular homeostasis in a reciprocal manner to enhance the proliferative and survival
properties of cancer cells. We expect that the unravelling of the complex relationship between early
endosomes, mitochondria, iron and signaling and cancer progression will provide new tools for cancer therapy
and diagnosis. However, current approaches that investigate subcellular cancer cell biology of early
endosomal pathway on human breast cancer cells grown in 2D culture are not adequate to fully understand
how early endosomes can be re-programmed to support and enhance cancer cell proliferation, survival,
migration and/or invasiveness. Since 3D growth has been shown to affect organelle morphology, the analysis
of the morphology and function of organelles in 3D tumor systems is the new frontier of cancer cell biology.
Here, we will tackle this challenge by studying early endosomes, a complex and dynamic organelle, and their
interaction with mitochondria, in a comparative manner across 2D-culture cancer cell lines, 3D breast tumor
systems and human tumor frozen tissue sections. In summary, to advance our basic understanding of breast
cancer cell biology on a subcellular level, we will investigate the role of the morphology and function of early
endosomes and their interaction with mitochondria on the regulation of iron homeostasis and receptor-
mediated signaling pathways in 3D breast tumor systems.

 Yersinia pestis, the etiologic agent of plague, has been responsible for high mortality in several epidemics
throughout human history. Plague has been classified as a re-emerging disease by the World Health
Organization since there are several thousand reported cases of the disease worldwide annually and
multidrug-resistant Y. pestis strains occur in recent years. The plague bacillus has been used as a biological
weapon recorded in human history and is one of the more likely biological threats to be used by terrorists.
Currently, no licensed plague vaccines are available in Western world. Isolation of virulent F1-negative Y.

overcome the drawbacks of subunit vaccines composed of LcrV and F1 antigens, we propose to use Y.

 Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a growing sleep-related breathing disorder with the prevalence rate of
10-15% in the middle-age adults and of 32%-62% in elderly. OSA patients undergo recurrent upper airway
collapse due to suppression of activity of upper airway dilator muscles during sleep, which causes repeated
hypoxia, frequent stressful arousals and sleep deprivation. OSA has a major health impact due to its
association with cardiovascular, metabolic and neurocognitive morbidities, including a risk factor for developing
Alzheimer’s disease and increased mortality in older adults.
 Brainstem noradrenergic (NA) system plays an important role in maintaining the tonus of upper airway
(UA) muscles to keep airway open during wakefulness. Therefore, the decrease of NA release during sleep
largely contributes to a loss of the UA muscle tone at night, which is a major neurological cause of OSA.
Studies suggest that aging has a detrimental effect on the NA system. However, there is little information
regarding age-related changes in the control of UA muscles by brainstem NA neurons, which may be a basis
of the increased prevalence of OSA in older population.
 In the proposed project, we will use a novel molecular-genetic approach that will allow a cell-type-specific
activation of NA neurons in the brainstem A1/C1, A5, A7 and SubCorelueus (SubC) nuclei while recording
activity of the genioglossus (GG), a major UA dilator muscle, during natural sleep and wakefulness in young (3-
4 months) and old (16-20 months) behaving DBH-Cre mice. We will determine the age-related changes in 1)
the ability of A1/C1, A5, A7 and SubC neurons to activate the GG muscle; 2) the contribution of A1/C1, A5, A7
and SubC neurons to depression of the GG muscle activity during NREM sleep and REM sleep; 3) the
number of NA neurons in these and other brainstem NA nuclei; and 4) the density of axons and their terminals
that originate from A1/C1, A5, A7 and SubC neurons and project to hypoglossal and other UA motoneurons.
 The proposed work will reveal neurological bases of the reduction in effectiveness of UA muscles to
maintain UA open during sleep in older individuals. The results of this study will fill a major gap in our
understanding of underlying mechanisms of OSA pathogenesis in elderly and lay the groundwork for
translational research of OSA pathology in aging to develop preventive and/or therapeutic strategies for clinical
management of OSA in older patients.

disease (CMT) is the most common inherited neurological disorders, affecting an estimated
individuals in the U.S. and 2.6 million people worldwide. CMT affects both sensory and motor nerves
in the peripheral nervous system. In patients with CMT, peripheral nerves slowly degenerate resulting in muscle
weakness and atrophy in the limbs as well as neuropathic pain. There is no cure for CMT, but physical and
occupational therapies, braces and other orthopedic devices, and orthopedic surgery may help with the disabling
symptoms of the disease. In addition, pain-relief drugs can be prescribed for severe nerve pain.
 One subtype of CMT, CMT1G, is caused by dominant mutations in the Pmp2 gene, , encoding for a fatty
acid chaperone specifically expressed in Schwann cells, including the in-frame deletion (p.Ile50del) which was
associated to a severe and early onset demyelinating CMT1 disease.
In this project, we propose to examine how the mutation (p.Ile50del) in Pmp2 mouse gene causes a
demyelinating CMT1 disease. We will use CRISPR/Cas9 technology to generate a faithful knock-in mouse
model of CMT1G. We will then investigate two possible pathological gain-of-function. First, , like in some other
CMTs, CMT1G-related mutations could lead to aberrant protein folding, stability and localization of PMP2 and
be detrimental to Schwann cell functions. Second, we will investigate the possibility that the Pmp2 p.Ile50del
mutation alters the fatty acid chaperone function of PMP2 and impair fatty acid uptake in Schwann cells, limiting
myelin biosynthesis.
 Determining whether the in-frame deletion mutation (p.Ile50del) alters PMP2 folding, stability, fatty acid
binding properties, fatty acid uptake and myelin lipid biosynthesis will further our understanding of the molecular
dysregulation associated to PMP2 mutations in CMT1G and offer core foundation for future investigations to test
the direct effect of those molecular dysregulations in the pathophysiology of CMT1G.

accounts for significant lifelong disability and important economic loss. There
CMT type 1 is a demyelinating peripheral
neuropathy characterized by reduced motor nerve conduction velocities (less than 38 m/s) and segmental
demyelination and remyelination with onion bulb formations on nerve biopsy. Despite the different subtypes of
CMT associated with distinct genetic causes and pathogenetic mechanisms, all forms of CMT1 eventually
converge on the loss of myelinated nerve fibers. Thus, a common approach based on enhancing myelination in
diseased nerves without exacerbating myelin damages must be identified to provide widely effective therapy for
the array of CMT neuropathies.
 We previously showed that enhancing axonal NRG1tIII signaling increases fatty acid levels in myelin,
improves myelination and nerve function in mouse models for inherited demyelinating neuropathy, through an
alternative EGR2-independent pathway. Notably, we found that PMP2, a fatty acid-binding protein is uniquely
up-regulated downstream NRG1tIII overexpression in Schwann cells. Our central hypothesis of this proposal is
that overexpression of the fatty acid-binding protein PMP2 is a downstream promyelinating mediator of NRG1tIII-
mediated hypermyelination and that sustained overexpression of PMP2 is sufficient to improve myelin formation,
without exacerbating myelin damages. We have now compelling preliminary evidence that PMP2
overexpression in Schwann cells enhances the uptake of fatty acid, increases ATP production, and is beneficial
to Schwann cell myelination and remyelination. Thus, we propose to determine if PMP2 overexpression is a
suitable strategy to improve myelination defects in inherited peripheral demyelinating neuropathy (P0S63del),
which of PMP2 functions are beneficial to improve myelin formation, and how Pmp2 expression is being
regulated. The new mechanistic insights on PMP2 overexpression enhancing myelination we will gain from this
work are in line with NINDS objective seeking fundamental knowledge about the nervous system that may
facilitate the development of future interventions to reduce the disease burden in patients with peripheral
neuropathies.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：SUMMARY: Identifying effective vaccines and their correlates of protection (COPs) for highly lethal human
(Hu) pathogens is problematic. Tularemia (rabbit fever), a severe zoonoses caused by Francisella tularensis
(Ft), is a prime example. Studies conducted in the 1960s revealed that Hu vaccination with the attenuated Live
Vaccine Strain (LVS) of Ft provided partial protection against low-dose aerosol challenge with virulent Ft
SchuS4 (S4); however, protection against higher challenge doses (~2,000 CFU) was subpar and no surrogate
markers of Hu protection were developed. Since the 1960s, no further Hu vaccine-efficacy trials have been
performed and the bulk of tularemia vaccine research has relied on inbred rodent models. Currently, there are
two unmet needs: i) vaccines that protect against high-dose aerosol challenge with S4 and ii) Hu-relevant
COPs to guide future clinical trials as envisioned by the FDA Animal Rule. To advance vaccine candidates
and their COPs, studies are needed in higher outbred models that faithfully replicate Hu responses.
 We used murine and rabbit (Rb) models to identify 2 lead vaccine candidates (S4ΔaroD and S4Δ guaBA)
that were effective against aerosols of WT S4 (target dose ~2,000 CFU). Our two strains along with WT LVS
and an externally developed mutant (S4clpB) were all found to provide various degrees of vaccine-mediated
protection. However, S4aroD was the only vaccine that provided significantly greater protection than
LVS. The S4aroD-mediated protection was robust (75%) up to challenge doses of ~20,000 CFU. During
these experiments, we also collected pre-challenge sera from individual Rbs. Following challenge outcome,
retrospective analysis of these sera identified putative COPs that predict S4 challenge outcome with
statistical significance. Our long-term goal is to foster advancement of the most effective Ft vaccine
candidate to Hu clinical trials. Our immediate objectives are to determine how well the S4aroD-mediated
protection and COPs observed in Rbs translate to non-human primates (NHP). We have formulated the
following Aims: Aim 1. Vaccine efficacy in the NHP model and Aim 2. Correlate analysis of NHP samples.
To further Hu translation, we have secured an invaluable resource: ~150 plasma from LVS-vaccinated Hu
banked prior to the pause in the US Army’s Special Immunization Program.
 The combined bacteriology, vaccinology, aerobiology and biostatistics expertise within this consortium
makes us exclusively well-positioned to complete these studies; our productivity in the prior cycle (>20
publications) documents our ability to achieve our goals. By the end of these studies, we will have determined
the efficacy of S4aroD-vaccination against S4 aerosol challenge regarding both NHP mortality and morbidity.
We will have performed a head-to-head comparison with LVS vaccination and determined if COPs developed
in Rbs are also predictive in NHPs. We envision that pivotal vaccine efficacy and correlate data developed in
the NHP model will place S4ΔaroD on the cusp of translation to advanced development and Hu-clinical trials.

 The goal of this project is to determine the activity-dependent mechanisms involved in contextual memory
formation in the hippocampal circuit of the CA3. Encoding memory requires activity-dependent changes to
neuronal properties and circuits, and improper function of these processes is thought to contribute to many
cognitive disorders. Contextual memory, in particular, requires the storage of environmental information
accompanying a salient stimulus to encode the context in which an experience occurred. The CA3 region of the
hippocampus is known to play a critical role in contextual memory due to extensive connections between its
pyramidal neurons, the principal excitatory neurons of the circuit. Changes in the CA3 circuit during learning and
memory, however, remain poorly understood. An emerging strategy in identifying active neuronal ensembles
during learning and memory is through detecting expression of immediate early genes. Known to rapidly turn on
upon the detection of cellular activity, immediate early gene expression is heterogenous across neuronal
populations. The transcription factor Npas4, an IEG expressed upon neuronal depolarization, has recently been
shown to activate during contextual memory tasks. Moreover, conditional knockout of Npas4 in the CA3 region
impairs contextual memory recall, suggesting that activity in the Npas4+ neuronal ensemble in this circuit is
required for proper contextual memory function. Recent evidence strongly suggest that contextual fear
conditioning induces changes at dentate granule cell to Npas4+ CA3 pyramidal neuron synapses. The full extent
to how CA3 pyramidal neurons in the Npas4+ ensemble changes through activity, however, remains unknown.
Previous evidence in areas such as CA1 and sensory cortices suggest that Npas4+ neurons exhibit changes in
both excitatory and inhibitory drive through synapse formation and elimination. To study the changes in neuronal
function and circuit activity in the CA3 in the Npas4+ ensemble, an Npas4-specific Robust Activity Marking
system (NRAM) will be employed to identify neurons active during a contextual memory task. Neurons recruited
to the Npas4 ensemble will be assessed through electrophysiology and structural studies to determine changes
in synaptic transmission, morphology, and intrinsic properties that contribute to memory formation. Changes in
connectivity and circuit function will also be surveyed to determine larger scale changes to the CA3 network in
the encoding of contextual memory. Finally, the necessity and sufficiency of the Npas4 neuronal ensemble, as
well as its relevance in other cognitive functions will be determined. The work proposed will elucidate
mechanisms of learning in the CA3 circuit, and provide a foundation in uncovering the molecular basis of
memory.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
Chromatin remodeling and gene expression are highly dynamic processes in the nucleus. The regulation of
these processes is crucial to maintain proper cellular functions. Chromatin remodeling enzymes mediate
changes in chromatin structure and control the cycling of chromatin-associated factors on and off the genome.
The remodeling of chromatin depends on metabolites (e.g., ATP and NAD+), which fuels chromatin remodeling
enzymes activity. NMNAT1 is a metabolic enzyme primarily involved in the local production of NAD+ in the
nucleus. NMNAT1 is thought to provide pools of NAD+ which fuels NAD+-dependent chromatin remodeling
enzymes, including SIRT1 and PARP1. However, various studies suggest that NMNAT1 may also allosterically
regulate these enzymes activity in an enzymatic independent manner. Nonetheless, the role of NMNAT1 in
regulating chromatin remodeling and gene expression through local NAD+ production and interactions with
chromatin remodeling enzymes remains poorly defined. In this proposal, I seek to define the role of NMNAT1 in
regulating chromatin remodeling enzymes activity, chromatin structure, and gene expression. I hypothesize that
the cycling of NMNAT1 on the genome produces local NAD+ gradients that regulate chromatin-modifying
enzyme activity, influencing rapid changes in chromatin structure and gene expression of target genes. To
address this hypothesis, I will (1) establish an NMNAT1 knock-out cellular system to perform structure-function
studies in live cells and identify phenotypical defects upon depletion of NMNAT1. To validate this system, I will
perform rescue experiments with wild-type NMNAT1 and catalytic dead mutant NMNAT1. (2) Examine how
NMNAT1 regulates the expression of chromatin remodeling enzymes (e.g., SIRT1) target genes by defining
changes in chromatin structure, gene expression and genomic occupancy, and (3) establish how NMNAT1
cycling dynamics regulate chromatin remodelers and transcriptional bursting. These studies will be essential to
determine how nuclear metabolic enzymes like NMNAT1 and metabolite production regulate chromatin structure
and gene expression of target genes. This knowledge will define new paradigms regarding gene expression and
regulation. Under the mentorship of Drs. Robert Coleman and Robert H. Singer, Yessenia Cedeno Cedeno will
receive multi-disciplinary training in molecular and cellular biology combined with expertise in state-of-the-art
microscopy. This will allow Yessenia to successfully execute the proposed research and training plans and
advance her professional career as an independent scientist.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
Modern neuroscience faces the challenge of bridging our understanding of single cell activity patterns to large
population dynamics. Brain oscillations evoked by sensory stimuli are fluctuations in field potentials reflecting
the combined activity of neural populations driven by a given stimulus. Oscillations have been observed in
many species from invertebrates to primates, and have been implicated in various processes like attention and
perceptual gating. Barn owls are specialists in sound localization studied for several decades. Their well-
described midbrain stimulus selection network, a circuit dedicated to localizing salient sounds, provides a
unique opportunity to evaluate the role of brain oscillations in coding. Previous in vivo recordings in the owl’s
optic tectum (OT), homolog of the mammalian superior colliculus, have shown that gamma oscillations (25-140
Hz) are tuned to both visual and auditory space. However, previous recordings in deep midbrain structures,
like OT, have relied on single electrodes and light tranquilization. These technical limitations impede our
understanding of how oscillations may spread across the space map at a given time, and underscores the
question of generalizability to awake processes like attention and perception. Our lab has pioneered population
recordings across the space map using multielectrode arrays, and has recently developed chronic microdrive
implants for recordings in awake owls. With these technical achievements, we will address several open
questions regarding the role of oscillations in perception of salient stimuli and stimulus selection. Aim 1 will
evaluate the spatial extent of gamma oscillations, and determine whether oscillations organize spike patterning
to preferred phases. Initial analyses show that sound stimulation with the preferred direction increases power
within the gamma range in a focal manner, supporting the hypothesis that spike patterning driven by brain
oscillations has a role in coding sound location. Aim 2 will compare oscillation properties across awake and
anesthetized states. Preliminary data and analysis suggest that while gamma power is higher in the awake
state, phase locking of spikes to gamma oscillations is consistent across states, suggesting significant
functional effects of gamma oscillations in organizing spike patterning are preserved during anesthesia. In Aim
3, we will conduct simultaneous recordings in the auditory thalamus and OT in awake behaving owls to test the
hypothesis that gamma oscillations play a role in perception of salient sounds and stimulus selection. We will
pair sound orienting behaviors, such as head turning and pupillary dilation responses, with electrophysiology to
elucidate the coding mechanisms underlying interregional signaling during perception. Understanding how the
owl’s midbrain stimulus selection circuit utilizes oscillations to conduct bottom-up relay and stimulus selection
can provide insight to similar processes in human audition where the most relevant auditory stream must be
prioritized in circumstances when the auditory scene is complex (cocktail party effect), and may inform novel
optimization strategies for hearing aids.

 The members of the Transforming Growth Factor (TGF)-Beta superfamily (TGF-Betas, Bone
Morphogenetic Proteins/BMPs, Growth differentiation factors/GDFs, activins, etc), play a central role in
repair, remodeling and fibrosis of the infarcted heart. TGF-Betas signal through heterotetrameric
complexes composed of two type II and two type I TGF-Beta receptors (TBetaRII and TBetaRI respectively). TBetaRI
activation transduces signals through a family of intracellular effectors, the receptor-activated Smads
(R-Smads: Smad1/2/3/5/8), or by stimulating non-Smad cascades. The profile of type 1 receptors
activated by a specific TGF-Beta superfamily member determines which downstream signaling cascade
will be activated. Traditional concepts suggest that the 3 TGF-Beta isoforms (TGF-Beta1, -Beta2 and -Beta3) signal
through Smad2 or Smad3, whereas BMPs activate Smad1 and Smad5. Studies in endothelial cells
have challenged this concept, suggesting that TGF-Betas may stimulate both Smad1 and Smad2/3
signaling, with the 2 pathways exerting antagonistic effects. We have previously demonstrated cell-
specific actions of TGF-Beta/Smad3 signaling in myocardial infarction that contribute to myofibroblast
activation, modulate cardiomyocyte survival and function, and regulate macrophage phagocytic activity,
and anti-inflammatory transition. However, the role of the Smad1 cascade in repair, remodeling and
fibrosis of the infarcted heart remains unknown, and the effects of Smad1 on phenotype and function of
immune and reparative cells has not been investigated.
 Our proposal explores the role of Smad1 signaling in repair and remodeling of the
infarcted heart. Our preliminary data show that Smad1 is activated predominantly in infarct
myofibroblasts and macrophages, but also in border zone cardiomyocytes and in pericytes. In vitro,
TGF-Beta isoforms potently activate Smad1 in cardiac reparative cells (macrophages and fibroblasts). In
vivo, our cell-specific loss-of-function experiments, revealed unanticipated anti-fibrotic effects of Smad1
in myofibroblasts and showed that in myeloid cells, Smad1 regulates the angiogenic properties of
macrophages. Accordingly, we will explore cell-specific actions of Smad1 in cardiac repair and we will
dissect the molecular mechanisms of Smad1 effects in 4 specific aims:
 Specific aim 1: to investigate the role of Smad1 in regulation of fibroblast phenotype
following MI and to explore the molecular basis for Smad1-mediated anti-fibrotic effects. RNA-
seq analysis suggests that the antifibrotic effects of Smad1 may involve competition with Smad3
signaling, or interactions with STAT6 and p53 fibrogenic pathways. The role of these mechanisms will
be investigated in vitro and in vivo.
 Specific aim 2: to study the role of macrophage Smad1 in repair and remodeling of the
infarcted heart. Our preliminary data show that macrophage-specific Smad1 perturbs repair of the
infarcted heart by restraining the angiogenic properties of macrophages through downregulation of the
angiogenic chemokine CXCL12. We will explore the mechanisms for the angiogenesis-regulating
actions of macrophage Smad1 in vitro and in vivo.
 Specific aim 3: to investigate the molecular basis for Smad1 vs Smad2/3 activation in
fibroblasts and macrophages and to test the hypothesis that the TBetaRI profile may be a key
determinant of the transcriptomic and functional heterogeneity of reparative cells. We will use
flow cytometry and single nucleus RNA-seq in vivo, and cell biological assays in vitro, to study the role
of specific TBetaRIs in regulation of the phenotype and functional properties of fibroblasts and
macrophages.
 Specific aim 4: to study the role of the Smad1 pathway in cardiomyocytes and in
pericytes in the infarcted and remodeling myocardium.
 The proposed studies will provide for the first time insights into the role of Smad1 in regulation
of myocardial inflammation and fibrosis, will dissect the mechanisms for Smad1-mediated actions, and
will explore the molecular basis for the functional and transcriptomic heterogeneity of immune and
reparative cells in the infarcted myocardium.

This proposal is in response to the PAR-19-183 (Biology of Bladder Cancer).
Bladder cancer is one of the most common malignancies in the United States.
The survival rate of bladder cancer has been largely unchanged for the last 30
years. Very recently PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors were approved by FDA for the
treatment of patients with metastatic bladder cancer, but worked in only a subset
of ~15-25% of patients. Thus, there is a pressing need to develop new and
effective treatment for bladder cancer. Developing novel checkpoint inhibitors,
especially inhibitors that target outside the PD1/PD-L1 and CTLA-4 pathways, is
a promising strategy and may potentially have high impact in clinical
management of human bladder cancer. Our central hypothesis of this proposal is
that KIR3DL3-HHLA2 is a previously unrecognized immunosuppressive pathway
as well as a novel therapeutic target in human bladder cancer. Guided by our
published clinical and basic research and our strong preliminary data, we will
pursue following specific aims: 1) Investigate the cellular and molecular
mechanisms of HHLA2 expression in human bladder cancer and APCs; 2)
Dissect co-inhibitory function and signaling of the KIR3DL3-HHLA2 pathway; and
3) Develop new immunotherapies against human bladder cancer by targeting the
KIR3DL3-HHLA2 pathway. This proposal comprises an integrated network of
multi-disciplinary collaborative investigators (immunologists, urologists,
oncologists, and bioinformaticians) to accelerate translational research and
maximize future clinical benefits. The outcomes of this project will reveal new
fundamental biology of human bladder cancer and will guide the rational
development of new immunotherapies for the treatment of human bladder
cancer.

major discoveries on function and structure of B7x, a much less studied B7 family
member that was originally discovered by us.
 Immune checkpoint blockade of PD-1/PD-L1 and CTLA-4 have advanced
the treatment of cancer patients. However, one of the biggest challenges is that
the majority of cancer patients do not respond to these treatments. Clearly, new
strategies targeting additional immune checkpoints are needed to improve the
immunotherapy of human cancers.
 Our basic and clinical studies and crystal structure analysis suggest B7x
immune checkpoint has very different mechanisms and provides an excellent
target to develop new immunotherapies. Furthermore, we recently discovered
HHLA2 as a homolog of B7x and a new member of the B7 family, which provides
a unique opportunity to study a new human immune checkpoint. Thus, our
central hypothesis is that B7x and HHLA2, two less-studied members of the B7
family originally discovered by us, are critical immune evasion pathways within
the tumor microenvironment and are therapeutic targets for new cancer
immunotherapies. This hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three aims: 1)
Dissect molecular and cellular mechanisms by which tumor-expressed B7x
induces immunosuppression within the tumor microenvironment; 2) Develop new
immune checkpoint blockade targeting B7x: Combination therapies and
mechanisms; and 3) Elucidate the HHLA2 pathway: A new homology of B7x. We
have generated a number of novel tools which provides us with unique
opportunities to address challenges and realize goals. The outcomes of this
project will reveal new immune evasion mechanisms in the tumor
microenvironment and will establish the foundation for clinical design of new
immunotherapies, which could potentially be effective in tumors that resist
current PD-1/PD-L1 and CTLA-4 targeted therapies.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Inflammatory liver diseases such as chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection can progress to liver fibrosis and
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Hepatic T cell immunity is closely linked to liver diseases since T cells are not
only essential for the clearance of hepatotropic viruses like HCV but may also cause liver injury and contribute
to disease progression. However, the specific role of functionally distinct CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subsets or
innate-like T cells, such as natural killer T (NKT) cells, in mediating an effective antiviral immune response or
regulating liver damage during inflammation are not well understood. Thus, gaining new insights into the
functional biology of hepatic T cell subsets is a prerequisite for the development of HCV vaccine strategies and
immunotherapeutic options for the treatment of progressive liver diseases.
Limited access to human liver tissue and the lack of immune-competent small animal models has impeded
studies of hepatic antiviral immune mechanisms. However, we have recently developed an immune-competent
mouse model of an HCV-related virus, Norway rat hepacivirus (NrHV), which shares significant virological and
immunological similarities with HCV infection in humans. This advance now allows for in-depth mechanistic
studies of anti-hepaciviral immunity in vivo.
Our initial analysis of hepatic lymphocyte subsets during acute, chronic and secondary NrHV infection revealed
a significant induction of a diverse antiviral type 1 T cell response and T cell dependent viral clearance. However,
we also made the unexpected observation that subsets of hepatic CD8+ T cells and NKT cells are polarized
towards type 2 immunity and may contribute to immune-regulation. In this proposal, we will build on these
preliminary data and elucidate the functional properties and potential crosstalk of distinct hepatic type 1 T cells
and type 2 cytokine secreting lymphocyte subsets during NrHV infection. Specifically, we will use high-
dimensional flow cytometry, in vivo functional approaches and/or transcriptome analysis to 1) define the
functional role of different virus-specific effector and memory CD8+ T cell subsets, 2) determine the kinetic and
impact of CD4+ T cells on the generation of virus-specific CD8+ T cells and protective immunity, 3) delineate the
function of type 2 CD8+ and NKT cell subsets and define their impact on liver damage, virus-specific T cells and
other hepatic immune cells during different stages of infection. Finally, we aim to translate our main findings from
the mouse model to human HCV patients.
Our data will provide novel biological insight into the role and interplay of distinct hepatic type 1 and type 2 T cell
and NKT cell subsets in mediating viral clearance, protective immunity, tissue pathology or repair during a
hepatotropic virus infection in vivo.

National Research Service Award (T32) entitled Mechanisms of Cardiovascular Disease.
Building on the long tradition of NIH-sponsored cardiovascular research training at the Albert
Einstein College of Medicine, this program draws on the talents and experience of 14 faculty
members representing 7 different departments to train young investigators working within 3
areas of thematic focus: 1) Myocardium – Injury and Aging, 2) Vascular Development and
Disease, and 3) Metabolism – Cardiovascular Risk. The mission of this program is to provide
the next generation of investigators, including both pre- and postdoctoral trainees, with state-of-
the art concepts, experiences, and skills required to initiate and sustain successful long-term
independent careers in cardiovascular research. The experience with our first group of trainees
has been gratifying, as these individuals have developed their research projects, presented their
work in both national and international forums, published extensively in high profile journals, and
in several cases, gone on to full-time academic positions for further research. For the next
funding cycle, we plan to build on interactions with academic clinical cardiologists, which have
benefitted our current trainees, and we request the addition of 1 predoctoral training position,
based on the growth of the Einstein Graduate school. We are confident that our program will
continue to produce outstanding new cardiovascular investigators, and thereby contribute to
advances in cardiovascular health in the US and around the world.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) is a major driver of the HIV epidemic, but the underlying
biological mechanisms have not been delineated. Recurrent HSV-2 shedding, which occurs
more often in HIV-infected persons, is characterized by the recruitment and persistence of
CD4+ T cells and other immune cells at sites of HSV-2 reactivation as well as an increase in
activated CD4+ T cells in the peripheral blood. These findings prompted us to test the
hypothesis that HSV-2 induces transcriptional changes in CD4+ T cells that promote HIV
replication and/or reactivation. We exposed primary CD4+ T cells or a latently HIV-infected T
cell line to HSV-2 and, using RNA sequencing, identified significant transcriptional changes
both in the HSV-2 infected and bystander cells. Importantly, the transcriptional changes were
associated with an increase in HIV replication and reactivation. One of the most significant
responses we observed in both HSV-2 infected and bystander cells was an increase in
expression of the long noncoding RNA, MALAT1. MALAT1 impacts the expression of multiple
transcripts including the HIV long terminal repeat (LTR) through interactions with the
Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2). We knocked out MALAT1 in an HIV-latently
infected cell line and showed that HIV latency reversal was significantly reduced but not
abolished when the knockout compared to the parental cells were infected with HSV-2.
Building on this foundation, we propose to further define MALAT1-mediated and identify
MALAT1-independent mechanisms by which HSV-2 promotes HIV replication and
reactivation. We will take advantage of a longitudinal biorepository of peripheral blood
mononuclear cells from people living with HIV and compare the responses to HSV-2 during
periods of HIV viremia and viral suppression. We will expose the cells to HSV-2 and conduct
single cell RNA sequencing, proteomic and histone analyses and determine how the cellular
responses to HSV-2 enhance HIV replication and promote HIV latency reversal. We will then
focus on changes at the site of HSV-2 reactivation using genital skin biopsies collected at the
time of an HSV outbreak (lesion and unaffected tissue) and after resolution in HIV-infected
and uninfected individuals. This will also allow us to assess interactions between different cell
types including epithelial cells, which are primary targets of HSV replication. We will use
cutting-edge high resolution spatial technologies to identify gene and protein expression in
the tissue. Results of these studies have great translational relevance and will identify new
targets to promote or prevent HIV latency reversal that can ultimately lead to HIV eradication.

Physician-Scientists” T32 Program to train and increase the number of investigators from under-represented in
medicine (URM) backgrounds, committed to research relevant to cardiovascular, pulmonary, and hematologic
diseases, and sleep (HLBS) disorders and to also address disparities in health in pediatric and adult
populations. We will apply the strengths of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine (Einstein) and the
Montefiore Health System (Montefiore), with our outstanding record of recruiting a diverse group of trainees
and developing scientists and clinician-investigators, to develop a new generation of diverse scientists highly
trained in HLBS research. This training will occur in the Bronx, the most diverse county in the United States,
where over 95% of the population is of Hispanic or African American heritage. The population in the Bronx also
has high burden of HLBS disorders. Our program includes 28 established faculty mentors conducting funded
HLBS research representing 9 different departments. We request resources to support 3 postdoctoral trainees
who will spend 2 years in training. Our specific aims are (Aim 1) to increase trainee knowledge and skills in
research through hands-on, mentored research from established, senior scientists; (Aim 2) to increase the
number of postdoctoral trainees who pursue academic careers in research; and (Aim 3) to increase the
number of postdoctoral trainees who successfully compete for extramural funding. The training plan will include
individualized curriculum based on the trainee prior experience, competencies and skills with structured
classwork, seminars and workshops that supplement hands-on research with mentors. Emphasis will be
placed on experiential mentored research experiences as well as professional development activities to
prepare the trainees for a research career in academic medicine. The knowledge and skills learned from this
training program and the other educational and professional development activities promoted by PODIUM will
allow this new cadre of URM investigators to advance the HLBS research. We will conduct a careful and
rigorous evaluation of the program to maintain and enhance its quality. To help strengthen the pathway of
diverse scientists, we propose innovative collaborations where PODIUM trainees will serve as career role
models to predoctoral students in established academic programs, such as Bronx Community Health Leaders
(BxCHL), the Einstein Office of Diversity Enhancement (ODE) programs and Leadership, Engagement, and
Diversity in Education and Residency (LEADER) to increase interest of URM students in academic research
careers. Our ultimate goal is to provide the next generation of URM investigators with the state-of-the art
experiences and skills required to initiate and sustain successful independent careers in HLBS research. This
training program brings our institution's considerable depth, rigorous scientific approach, and tradition of
innovation to bear on important and highly prevalent burden of HLBS disorders in our community.

We present our proposal to acquire a Perkin Elmer IVIS SpectrumCT instrument that will be
installed in the IVIS core facility at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. This new instrument
will replace a 12 year old imaging system that is at the end of its useful life. The replacement of
the old imaging system with the IVIS SpectrumCT instrument is a critical need for the Einstein
NIH funded investigators. IVIS been used effectively to monitor tumor or cellular migration and
to monitor dissemination of a variety of pathogens and is considered state of the art for these
type of studies. Because luciferase or fluorescence activity can be monitored without sacrificing
animals, longitudinal measurements can be made on individual mice over time minimizing the
number of animals required to obtain experimental data. NIH funded research projects at
Einstein that would benefit from this instrument are described in the proposal and include
projects in cancer biology and infectious disease pathogenesis. As noted, we require this
instrument to replace an IVIS imaging system that was acquired in 2010 and is the only IVIS
instrument in the core facility and the only functional IVIS imaging system at Einstein. Due to
the age of the current system several issues have arisen in the imaging camera and power
system indicating it is near the end of its useful duty cycle. In addition, the current software
updates are limited due to the age of the computer system in this instrument. Engineering
support and parts for this system are being increasing difficult to source and the vendor has
indicated that engineering support for this system will be eliminated. The Einstein IVIS core has
sufficient space to house the IVIS SpectrumCT instrument and renovations will not be required
to accommodate and install this instrument. In the last year, the Einstein IVIS Core laboratory
has assisted 40 different investigator laboratory groups with imaging using the IVIS system.
The Einstein IVS Core is also a critical support service for the Einstein Cancer Center and the
ERC-CFAR Einstein-Rockefeller-CUNY Center for AIDS research.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
Vascular calcification is common in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and contributes to mortality.
Calciprotein particles (CPPs) have emerged as a promising therapeutic target. In CKD, excess CPPs build up
in the blood and transform into pathogenic forms—primary and secondary CPPs, which have been shown in
preclinical studies to cause vascular calcification by inducing inflammation, dysfunction of endothelial cells, and
calcification of vascular smooth muscle cells. Whether and how serum CPPs lead to vascular calcification in
CKD patients is an important knowledge gap. Our study will help fill this gap by testing the hypothesis that
serum CPPs from CKD patients lead to macro-calcification, micro-calcification, and calcification of human
vascular smooth muscle cells. Because vascular calcification resembles bone mineralization, agents that
inhibit vascular calcification may adversely affect bone formation. By studying the function of vascular cells, our
proposal provides mechanistic insight that may serve as a basis for future CPP-related therapies to attenuate
vascular calcification without impacting bone health. At a cellular level, vascular smooth muscle cells in arterial
media and endothelial cells in the intima play pivotal roles in vascular calcification. Vascular smooth muscle
cells undergo osteogenic differentiation, a process that initiates mineralization in the vessel walls; and
endothelial cells can regulate this process. Macro- and micro-calcification confer different cardiovascular risks,
and studying micro-calcification allows for early detection and intervention. Using our novel methods of
measuring serum CPP size and quantity, we will test our hypothesis in 3 aims. Aim 1 will determine the
association between serum CPPs and macro-calcification in coronary arteries by leveraging the Chronic Renal
Insufficiency Cohort, which has stored serum and assessment of macro-calcification in coronary arteries by
computed tomography (n=780). We will measure serum CPP size and quantity in these serum samples. We
will also measure serum markers for endothelial function corresponding to nitric oxide production, activation,
hemostasis, and inflammation, and determine whether these markers mediate the association between CPPs
and calcification. Aim 2 will determine the association between serum CPPs and micro-calcification of aorta in
a prospective longitudinal study of 60 patients with CKD stage 4. We will measure serum CPP size and
quantity in these patients, and quantify micro-calcification of aorta using 18F-sodium fluoride positron-emission
tomography at both baseline and Year 1. Aim 3 will define the effects of CPPs derived from CKD patients on
human primary vascular cells. We will generate CPPs from the serum of CKD patients recruited in Aim 2, and
test their effects on calcification of human smooth muscle cells, function of endothelial cells, and endothelial-
smooth muscle cell paracrine mechanism. We expect that CPPs induce calcification of smooth muscle cells,
and endothelial cells exposed to CPPs exacerbate this effect. By defining the effects of serum CPP on
vascular calcification, the results will inform the development of future CPP-targeted interventions.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
Senescence, like apoptosis, is an established tumor suppressive mechanism that protects against cancer
development by inducing sustained proliferative arrest. Apoptosis and senescence are common fates of cancer
therapy and both contribute to clinical response. When cancer cells receive a lethal dose of a cancer
therapeutic, they typically execute apoptosis. Conversely, cellular damage that results from sub-lethal doses
induces a senescent fate. Although therapies that trigger stable senescence (pro-senescent) are beneficial
because they suppress proliferation, senescent cancer cells can resume proliferation, often with more
biologically aggressive features, therefore the durability of senescence is an important pharmacologic property.
We have designed and synthesized congeners of the taxane-site tubulin molecule (+)-discodermolide (DDM),
that potently induce cell death AND senescence in taxane-refractory triple negative breast cancer models.
Pleasingly, the senescent phenotype induced by these analogs is significantly more durable than the parent
molecule, Taxol or other cytotoxic drugs, thereby improving the potential for prolonged anti-tumor efficacy.
Using X-ray crystallography, we will continue to evolve the chemistry of DDM to better engage underexplored
residues of the taxane pharmacophore to address whether differential occupation of DDM congeners impacts
pharmacology, cell fate and metabolic stability. We will also generate fluorescent DDM molecules to track the
distribution and longevity of DDM-stabilized microtubules using time-lapse imaging. Multiplexed, dose-
response modeling in taxane-refractory cancer cell lines will primarily guide the selection of lead DDM
molecules for in vivo analyses.
In Aim 2, we will use X-ray crystallography and Cryo-EM to decipher DDM-tubulin and DDM-microtubule
interactions, of lead DDM congeners. These results will feed back to Aim 1 to guide more efficient chemical
optimization and potentially provide mechanistic insight for the durable senescence of DDM molecules.
In Aim 3 we will evaluate the optimal dosing and in vivo safety of lead DDM molecules in C57BL/6 mice,
focusing on hematologic, neuropathic and behavioral metrics, as well as histopathologic analyses. Anti-tumor
efficacy in models of Taxol-resistance using patient-derived breast cancer xenografts will also be evaluated.
This interdisciplinary, collaborative program will employ chemical synthesis, structural biology and phenotypic
screening tactics to develop highly efficacious and metabolically stable DDM analogs that mobilize both
apoptosis and senescence cell fates to maximize tumor suppressive capabilities.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Aging-associated diseases are an increasing socio-economic burden despite efforts to improve
healthspan. Pathologies that cause degeneration of the nervous system are particularly
devastating, and in many cases are associated with decline in proteostasis and lysosomal
malfunction. Prime examples are Parkinson and Alzheimer’s disease that are characterized by
accumulation of insoluble protein aggregates that lead to neuronal decay. Lysosomal degradation
of cytoplasmic components depends on proper transport of hydrolases from the Golgi to
lysosomes where they encounter the acidic environment necessary for their activation.
Lysosomes are also important regulatory hubs that integrate nutritional signals and participate in
lipid metabolism, and these diseases are associated with alterations in lysosomal pH and
accumulation of lipids, particularly cholesterol in the lysosome.
 We have recently characterized Drosophila Lamp1, a bona fide homolog of the mammalian
LAMP1/2 proteins with partially redundant roles in autophagy and cholesterol assimilation.
Drosophila Lamp1 localizes to late endosomes and lysosomes and is, in contrast to Lamp1/2, not
required for development, autophagy, or viability; however, males have a reduced mean lifespan.
Critically, Lamp1 deficiency results in an increase in the number of acidic organelles in the fat
body, strongly suggesting defects in the regulation of the pH of the endolysosomal system.
Furthermore, Lamp1 mutant larvae have elevated levels of sterols and diacylglycerols, indicating
functions of Lamp1 in lipid transport beyond sterols, that we are in the unique possibility to assess
in the absence of confounding autophagy defects.
 This proposal will identify the connection between Lamp1 function, endolysosomal
acidification, and lipid metabolism, and investigate how these processes are connected to
neurological disorders. Because altered endolysosomal regulation contributes to many aging-
related diseases, our research will significantly advance our understanding of how dysfunction of
endolysosomal system underlies disease, ultimately leading to the development of novel
treatment strategies to improve healthspan.

This K01 Career Development Award application proposes a multidisciplinary 5-year training program to
provide the candidate, Dr. Zheng Wang, with the experience and resources necessary to launch a successful
career as an independent investigator. The training plan, developed closely with primary mentor Dr. Qibin Qi,
co-mentors Drs. Robert Burk and Jorge Kizer, and an Advisory Committee (Drs. Rob Knight, Robert Kaplan,
Tao Wang, and Anjali Sharma), will expand Dr. Wang’s research experience and expertise, in oral microbiome,
integrative multi-omics analyses, and cardiovascular disease (CVD) epidemiology. Building upon two well-
characterized HIV cohorts (Women's Interagency HIV Study, WIHS; Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study, MACS)
and pre-existing circulating metabolomics and proteomics data, the proposed research project offers the
candidate an exceptional opportunity to become proficient in the novel area of oral microbiome and integrative
multi-omics analyses research, in the field of CVD epidemiology in HIV population. Taking advantage of
collected oral saliva samples, carotid atherosclerosis (measured by ultrasound) and cardiac fibro-inflammation
(measured by magnetic resonance imaging) data, circulating metabolomics data and proteomic inflammatory
markers data in the WIHS, this project proposes to measure oral microbiome taxa and functional components
using shotgun metagenome sequencing, in 320 participants (216 HIV+ and 104 HIV-; 84 with carotid artery
plaque and 236 without plaque). We will identify alterations in the oral microbiome associated with HIV-related
factors, and examine associations of oral microbiome features with subclinical carotid atherosclerosis and
cardiac fibro-inflammation. We will further investigate the oral-gut microbiome crosstalk (with pre-existing gut
metagenomics data) and its implications in subclinical CVD, in the context of HIV. Replication analysis will be
performed in 400 MACS participants to validate the findings. Moreover, we will examine prospective
associations of baseline microbial-associated metabolites with incident carotid artery plaque over 7-years
follow-up (n=737), to explore the role of microbiota in CVD development. Employing advanced "multi-omics"
analytical approaches, we will examine the microbiome–metabolome–proteome interactions and generate a
network illustrating interrelationships between oral and gut bacteria, circulating metabolites, proteomic
inflammatory markers, microbial translocation biomarkers, CVD and HIV infection.
Findings from this study will provide preliminary data for a larger study proposal to measure oral and gut
microbiome longitudinally and integrate microbiome with other omics data more comprehensively. These
studies will advance our understanding of interrelationships among microbiome, host inflammation and
metabolism, and shed light on potential underlying mechanisms, which will provide useful information for
effective strategies in the prevention and management of CVD in people living with HIV.
