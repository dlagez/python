Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) provide unchallenged specificity compared to small molecules, representing a
growing market of 150+ billion dollars. Due to their structural complexity and poor stability, however, they remain
difficult to formulate at high concentrations, making intravenous (IV) delivery of mAbs the “gold standard”. IV
injections present major drawbacks, such as patient discomfort, long injection times, and high medical costs
associated with in-hospital administration. Subcutaneous (SC) delivery is a convenient route of administration
for large molecules, as it allows for rapid injections (seconds), requires minimal skills (self-injection), and allows
for systemic delivery. It remains an open challenge to reformulate mAbs to a SC form. Most mAbs requires large
dosage to be effective (>300 mg), and SC administration volumes are constrained to only 1-2 ml, hundreds of
times smaller than typical IV formulations
SC injections using hydrogel microparticles (HMP) offer a promising method for encapsulating and delivering
protein-based drugs. The composition, size, and mechanical properties of HMPs can be widely tuned to facilitate
their injection through needles for subcutaneous delivery. Alginate-based MP are becoming increasingly popular
due to their rheological properties and high biocompatibility. Additionally, the anionic nature of alginate enables
electrostatic entrapment of cationic proteins independently of the hydrogel porosity, making it a candidate for
hydrogel-based antibody formulations. However, current manufacturing technologies are limited to low
concentration of polymer (<5%), and low cargo loading, typically below 30 mg/ml for antibodies, resulting in
inadequate mechanical and therapeutic properties.
Through the support of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project, we aim at improving
clinical care of millions of patients by reformulating IV-delivered mAbs to a SC form, meaning patients could
administer their life saving drugs with reduced pain and discomfort, at a fraction of the cost.
We plan to leverage Acoustophoretic Printing (AP) to generate alginate MP to stabilize highly concentrated mAbs
formulation. This platform technology enables microparticle generation under modest shear forces without the
need for a hydrophobic carrier fluid, thereby protecting the valuable cargo and minimizing contamination. The
technology features: high bio-compatibility with no oil or surfactant required, making this technology particularly
suitable for large proteins; high concentrations of cargo (>100mg/ml), including alginate (>10%); low particle size
variation (coefficient of variation of 1-3%) reducing costly sieving steps, consistency in cargo encapsulation and
delivery - hence significantly improving Good Manufacturing Practices - even at extreme loading.
This project aims to: (1) Manufacture mAbs loaded hydrogel-based microparticles for SC delivery and
characterize them in-vitro, including encapsulation efficiency, release profile, and injectability. (2) Conduct In vivo
study to investigate safety, bioavailability, and bioactivity of the MP-based formulations in murine models.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Modern drug analysis techniques are an integral part of research and healthcare today. Regrettably,
the current approach for sample collection consists of literally removing “a piece of the patient or experimental
animal” (whether it is a blood sample or a tissue biopsy) that is sent to the laboratory for analysis. Such a
procedure poses ethical issues, health risks for the medical personnel, and inconvenience for the investigated
being (patient or lab animal). Furthermore, although it has been recognized that tissue concentrations are
more predictive of clinical outcome than plasma concentrations, the assessment of drug distribution and
target site pharmacokinetics is very difficult because of lack of appropriate methodology. Point-of-care
devices for measuring electrolytes, cardiac markers, and several small molecules now reside in emergency
rooms and even at patient bedsides - but there are no clinical devices for fast monitoring of drug levels in
body fluids and tissues. The need for such devices is even greater for difficult to treat diseases such as
neoplasms.
 In response to the current challenges faced by drug analysis for pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics,
and therapeutic drug monitoring, we are proposing to apply innovative microsampling approaches to measure
therapeutic antibody concentrations in the tumors without collecting a physical sample from the investigated
organism. These methods feature reliable calibration, freedom from pumps, no osmotic effects, and
significant improvements in sensitivity. Furthermore, they are faster and more economical than classical
ones.
 The new methods will be applied for the first time to measure the tumor concentration of immune
checkpoint inhibitors that act by blocking the programmed cell death receptors on T cells.
 The proposed research will utilize biocompatible sampling devices for direct microextraction of
antibody drugs from tumors. These devices will be prepared by covering flexible medical-grade metal wires
with biocompatible polymers and high affinity extractive phases. The extracted analytes will be quantified
by chromatography and mass spectrometry to offer high specificity and low limits of detection.
 For quantitation, several calibration methods will be applied, such as external standard, diffusion-based
calibration, and kinetic calibration. The data will be used to build a pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model
for a representative therapeutic antibody, such as pembrolizumab.
 The new in vivo sampling method will be validated by comparison with large pore microdialysis. It is
expected that microextraction will provide better sensitivity, accuracy, less tissue damage (due to smaller size),
portability, and convenience (no pumps and fluids).

Sleep is a basic biological need and sufficient sleep is required for physical and mental health. Reduced or
disordered sleep contributes to an array of metabolic, inflammatory, cardiovascular, and neurological
disorders, reduces productivity and performance, and is a threat to public safety. Understanding the control
of sleep is therefore critical for human health and society. Sleep pressure (or sleepiness) has long been
thought to be driven by substances that accumulate in the brain, where they promote sleep by acting on
neural centers of sleep control. The identification of molecular mediators of sleep pressure in the brain would
be highly significant, in that it would provide obvious targets for the improvement of daily sleep. Here we
propose a large and unbiased screen for molecules that the fit the criteria for sleep promoting substances
that drive daily changes in sleep pressure and promote homeostatic increases in sleep following sleep
deprivation. To this end we have developed methods to differentiate molecules that rise with increasing
sleep pressure from those that rise in direct response to the mechanical perturbation necessary to keep
animal subjects awake. In doing so we have addressed a fundamental challenge to the identification of
molecular correlates of sleep pressure. Using Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization – Time of Flight
Mass Spectrometry, we will identify molecules whose abundance tracks sleep pressure within the central
brain, where sleep is controlled. The identification of candidate sleep substances will set the stage for new
mechanistic investigations of sleep in Drosophila whose aim is to identify conserved molecular mechanisms
of its homeostatic control. Given the existence of sleep-like states across the animal kingdom and the
presence of homeostatic sleep control even in animals with extremely simple nervous systems, discoveries
made in Drosophila are likely to reveal conserved features physiological systems regulating sleep.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Knowing the structure, dynamics and ligand binding specificity of proteins and nucleic acids is essential to
understanding the mechanisms of human disease and to the optimal design of molecules that can intervene
therapeutically in disease processes. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy is one of the most
versatile techniques for obtaining this molecular information. This tremendous value of NMR in biomedical
science is only realized through the application of powerful computational tools. Our goal in this project is to
continue the development of, and add powerful new features to, an integrated software application for the
computational analysis of NMR data. Having this effective software, NMRFx, for NMR is especially critical as
we realize that deep insight into macromolecular structure and function comes not from a single technique like
NMR, but from the complementary information from various techniques including NMR, X-ray crystallography,
and Cryo-electron microscopy. Scientists are no longer seeing these techniques as specialized techniques
usable by only domain experts, but as a collection of techniques that can and should be applied together.
Without this NMRFx software, researchers must otherwise use a variety of tools from different labs that have
different programming languages, scripting tools, naming conventions, graphical interfaces, documentation
styles etc. The NMRFx software that is the subject of this project integrates signal processing, data analysis,
visualization and macromolecular structure calculations based on NMR data. In the current project this
software will be enhanced with the addition of an integrated deep learning library that will allow new types of
data analyses using these new tools that are making major advances in scientific research. The performance
of the software will be dramatically enhanced by the addition of a software library that allows computations to
be dispatched to high-performance hardware like GPUs (graphical processing units) and FPGAs (Field
Programmable Gate Arrays). This performance enhancement will allow much faster computations and allow
use of algorithms that were previously too slow to use in interactive analyses. We will also complete the
implementation of the remaining features necessary for the full analysis of NMR data. We propose that by
providing new and experienced users with an enhanced version of our software application that has a common
installation protocol, interface style, data structures, and overall design, we can substantially lower barriers to
the use of NMR. NMRFx is making the use of NMR techniques more accessible to a wider population of
researchers. The software, including the addition of the deep learning and acceleration libraries, will increase
the contributions of NMR in a broad range of biological research areas that impact on human health.

 Human oral polymicrobial communities play a significant role in health and disease. Periodontitis is a
polymicrobial disease and is among the most common infections of humans. Recent next-generation sequencing
studies reveal that periodontal polymicrobial communities are comprised of a large diversity of bacterial species;
however, we have little to no understanding of the disease-role of some of the key members. Saccharibacteria
(TM7) is one such bacterial group that has been linked to multiple inflammatory diseases, including periodontitis.
In addition, TM7 belongs to a major bacterial lineage termed Candidate Phyla Radiation. Candidate Phyla
Radiation encompasses one-quarter of all bacterial diversity, yet they have been recalcitrant to laboratory
cultivation. Oral TM7 bacteria were the first to be cultivated, opening the door to many intriguing questions due
to their unique characteristics. TM7 has an ultra-small cell size (200-500 nm) with a highly reduced genome
lacking essential biological functions. More importantly, it is an epiparasitic bacteria that grows on the surface of
Actinobacteria (i.e., Actinomyces, Pseudopropionibacterium), which is another understudied bacterial group in
humans. Actinomyces has been shown to induce inflammatory response both in cultured cells and in animal
models. Our preliminary mouse periodontal studies were designed to investigate the role of TM7 and its host
bacteria, Actinomyces, in vivo. TM7/host bacteria pairs induced less inflammatory bone loss compared to host
bacteria alone, suggesting that oral Actinomyces and related bacteria can be a pathobiont (opportunistic
pathogen), and their pathogenicity is regulated by TM7 bacteria. The current proposal will investigate pathogenic
genes in TM7 host bacteria and how they are regulated by TM7 bacteria via metatranscriptomics. Identified
genes will be further tested by site-directed mutagenesis in the host bacteria (Aim 1). The proposal will also
determine the pathogenic and immunostimulatory activity of TM7 bacteria in epithelial and immune cell
interaction assay and will identify TM7 macromolecules that are involved in their interaction with the eukaryotic
cells (Aim 2). Lastly, this study will expand to culturing and characterizing additional taxonomically diverse TM7
bacteria from the periodontal patients, effectively creating a library of TM7 bacteria. This will allow us to determine
the general immunological behavior of TM7/host bacteria across different TM7 species (Aim 3). Accomplishment
of the proposal aims will improve the currently limited understanding of TM7 bacteria and its interaction with the
host bacteria, as well as generate the first understanding of TM7's role in periodontal and inflammatory diseases.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Host mucosal surfaces are highly specialized and possess a complex array of innate and adaptive immunity.
They provide the first line of protection against infectious agents by initiating protective responses to potential
pathogens. Furthermore, the symbiotic relationship of the hundreds of microbial species with the host requires
a fine-tuned response at the mucosal surface that prevents overgrowth of opportunistic pathogens, but sparing
beneficial microbes. While small RNAs (sRNAs) have been regarded as a class of intracellular regulatory
elements, emerging studies in plant-pathogen and host-gut microbiome interactions uncover that hosts can
exploit sRNAs, such as transfer RNA (tRNA)-derived sRNAs (termed “tsRNAs”), via encapsulation in
exosomes, as a new mode of bacterial gene modulation or defense mechanism. Yet, it remains to be
elucidated whether such sRNA-mediated inter-kingdom gene modulation or defense mechanism exist in the
context of host-oral microbiome interaction. To address this knowledge gap, the present R01 application will
focus on host-derived, exosome-borne, salivary tsRNAs, of which the biological functions have remained
largely elusive to date. Speficically, we recently demonstrated that human Normal Oral Keratinocyte-
Spontaneously Immortalized (NOKSI) cells released two exosome-borne tsRNAs, tsRNA-000794 and tsRNA-
020498, when challenged with Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn), a key oral commensal and opportunistic
periodontal pathogen. Importantly, these two tsRNAs can be readily detected from saliva in healthy human
subjects. Intriguingly, both tsRNAs exhibit highly selective, Fn-targeting antimicrobial activity—directly adding
synthetic mimics of these two tsRNAs, but not scramble RNA, to bacterial culture inhibits the growth of Fn, but
not that of Porphyromonas ginigivalis (Pg), a gram-negative periodontal pathogen or Streptococcus mitis (Sm),
a health-associated oral bacterium. In preliminary work, we further took a multi-facet approach to identify a
putative RNA-specific membrane transporter as well as candidate intracellular bacterial protein targets of Fn-
targeting tsRNAs. Building on our comprehensive preliminary data, the goal of this application is two-fold: (Part
I) achieve mechanistic understanding of the cross-kingdom trafficking of host-derived Fn-targeting tsRNAs and
their modulating effect on Fn growth during NOKSI-Fn interaction, through exosome tracking and in-depth
dissection of the tsRNAs transporter and intracellular targets in Fn; (Part II) expand our work to profile and
compare salivary tsRNAs between healthy and periodontitis subjects, with a focus on demonstrating the broad
implication of host-generated tsRNAs as a conserved mechanism to achieve host-microbial homeostasis. The
realization of this application will not only address a fundamental question by defining tsRNAs as a new class
of host defense molecules in maintaining host-microbiome homeostasis via targeted microbial modulation, but
also will pave the way for a new therapeutic strategy against oral diseases, considering the already successful
trajectory of nucleic acid therapeutics in recent years.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Sjögren's syndrome (SS) is a chronic autoimmune disease affecting millions of Americans, in which
salivary glands are the primary target of autoreactive T cells, leading to hyposalivation, the major
disease hallmark. Hyposalivation (dry mouth) causes a variety of oral health issues and severely
compromises quality of life. SS has no cure and current treatments are predominantly palliative. Failure
of therapies for SS are inextricably linked to the inability to control autoinflammation; thus, we propose
to investigate both simultaneously. To achieve sustainable salivary secretion, development of
approaches to simultaneously enhance endogenous salivary gland regeneration and protect the glands
from further injury from autoimmune inflammation are critically needed. Our preliminary studies
strongly suggest that there are protective actions provided by intermittent fasting (IF) in SS. In non-
obese diabetic (NOD) mice, a well-defined spontaneous model of SS, IF enhances the proliferation of
salivary gland stem cells, and upregulates Wnt and Notch signaling and Peroxisome Proliferator-
Activated Receptor-driven fatty acid oxidation, which are critically involved in the expansion and
differentiation of multiple stem cell types. It also mitigates autoreactive T helper 1, T helper 17 and
cytotoxic T cell responses in the salivary gland-draining lymph nodes. The objective of this proposed
project is to determine the previously unexplored impact of IF on the activity of endogenous salivary
gland stem/progenitor cells and autoimmune inflammation in SS to unravel the underlying molecular
and cellular mechanisms of IF benefits, with the long-term goal of developing effective and targeted
therapies to fundamentally improve salivary gland function. Based on the literature and our preliminary
results, we formulated the central hypothesis that IF exerts beneficial actions on salivary gland
restoration through promoting endogenous salivary gland regeneration and diminishing T cell mediated
autoimmune inflammation in SS. This hypothesis will be tested through the following specific aims: In
Aim 1, we will dissect the potential molecular mechanisms for the impact of IF on the proliferation and
differentiation of salivary gland stem cells in the NOD mouse, a spontaneous model of SS; In Aim 2,
we will assess the impact of IF on the self-expansion and cellular plasticity of ductal salivary gland
progenitor cells and acinar cells, the function and plasticity of T cell subsets, and the attenuation of
autoimmune inflammation in the salivary tissues, using lineage tracing mouse models and an inducible
model of SS. Successful completion of this study will provide new targets for the development of
effective new therapeutics for SS-like exocrinopathy, as well as provide insight into the treatment of
xerostomia caused by radiation, medications or aging, and other autoimmune diseases that share
similarities in their pathogenesis with SS.

This application proposes to lay the groundwork for precision medicine approaches to autism spectrum disorder
(ASD) by identifying reproducible clinically relevant brain-connectome-based subtypes. The proposal addresses
the clinical and biological heterogeneity of ASD by focusing on the intermediate level of analysis of systems
neuroscience, following clues that ASD is associated with abnormalities in the brain functional connectome.
Thus, we aim to identify neurosubtypes (NS), i.e., subgroups of individuals with homogeneous atypical features,
based on measures of intrinsic functional connectivity (iFC). Primary aims are to: 1) generate a large,
retrospectively harmonized data resource with comprehensive assessment of iFC and clinical phenotypes; 2)
identify iFC-based neurosubtypes and establish their associations with clinically relevant phenotypes; 3) test the
replicability of neurosubtypes and their associations with phenotypic measures in an independent sample . To
this end, we propose to leverage existing large-scale ASD neuroimaging data collections from the Autism Brain
Imaging Data Exchange, the National Database for Autism Research, and the Healthy Brain Network. Sample:
Age/Sex: Boys and girls, 6-18 years old. Diagnosis: ASD and neurotypical (NT) individuals. Size: to date, the
above neuroimaging resources contain a total N=3528; ASD n=2136, NT n=1392. Methods: Following
systematic and extensive data organization, rigorous quality assurance, and preprocessing we will proceed with
quantitative data harmonization using state-of-the-art methods. CovBat, the most advanced version of the
Bayesian framework, ComBat, will be applied to harmonize MRI data. It has been developed by Co-I Shinohara
to control for inter-scanner differences in MRI-based measures, as well as for errors arising from subject
differences in measurement covariance. Recent advances in item response theory will be used to harmonize
phenotypic data, informed by preliminary clinical work. To further enhance our clinical data harmonization efforts,
the neuroimaging data will be aggregated with phenotypic-only collections from Co-Is Lord and Bishop (ASD
n=1513). Connectopathy features: To scope the entire spectrum of ASD connectopathy, multiple features will be
assessed simultaneously for the first time. Neurosubtypes: Building on our feasibility work with Co-I Yeo,
homogeneous neural ASD subgroups will be identified through novel Bayesian latent factor modeling. It allows
for subjects to belong to subtypes in varying degrees, identifying hybrid, categorical and dimensional,
neurosubtypes. Other key questions include the relevance of MRI features studied, the diagnostic specificity of
neurosubtypes, and cross-subtyping method validity. The neurosubtypes identified and methods for
harmonization, along with all data generated for mega-analyses will be regularly shared, starting at the end of
year two. Findings will address critical knowledge gaps and the novel resource will offer the scientific community
opportunities to pursue independent inquiries transforming biological research and knowledge of ASD.

Salivary gland function is chronically impaired in Sjӧgren’s syndrome, an autoimmune exocrine gland disease
with no cure or effective treatment available. Aberrantly activated innate immune cells, autoreactive T- and B
cells, and proinflammatory cytokines collectively cause Sjogren’s-characteristic salivary gland inflammation and
dysfunction. There is an urgent need for novel, effective therapies that protect/improve salivary gland function
and ameliorate salivary gland inflammation. The importance of host gut microbiome in health and disease is
increasingly recognized, yet very little is known about the impact of gut microbiome on salivary glands, especially
the protective bacteria and their actions. Hence, the main objective of this project is to address this knowledge
gap, with a particular focus on identifying the potentially salivary gland-protective gut bacteria and revealing their
precise actions using both murine models and cells and samples from Sjӧgren’s disease patients. Our
preliminary studies showed that transplant of fecal bacteria from healthy C57BL/6 mice to the non-obese diabetic
mice, a spontaneous model of Sjӧgren’s syndrome, exerted a protective effect on salivary glands. The protection
was accompanied by reduced inflammatory responses and diminished expression of bromodomain containing
2, an epigenetic reader/modulator, in salivary gland epithelial cells. We also identified multiple specific bacterial
species with salivary gland-protective potentials based on our preliminary microbiome analyses and the pertinent
evidence from human studies in the literature. We formed the central hypothesis that healthy gut microbiota
contains bacterial species that, acting through their metabolites, protect salivary gland function by mitigating
inflammatory responses and dysfunction of salivary gland epithelial cells through mechanisms including
downregulating the expression of epigenetic reader of bromodomain containing 2. Aim 1 of this project will
define and discover the mechanisms underlying the protective effects of healthy C57BL/6 fecal microbiota
transplant on salivary glands in the non-obese diabetic mice and a second, induced model of Sjӧgren’s
syndrome. Aim 2 will explore the protective impact of specific gut bacterial species on salivary gland function
in the two mouse models. Aim 3 will identify and test microbial metabolites that may mediate the salivary gland-
protective impact of gut microbiota using both mouse SS models and cells/samples from human Sjӧgren’s
disease patients. The project will employ a combination of sophisticated immunological, microbiological and
systemic biological methodologies, including 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis of microbiome, RNA-
sequencing analysis of host cells, and metabolomic assays. Knowledge generated will have direct relevance to
and impact on human health, and will advance the development of novel, gut microbe/microbial metabolite-
based therapies to combat autoimmune Sjӧgren’s disease as well as other salivary gland inflammatory disorders.

The goal of this fast-track SBIR proposal is to increase patient adherence to SBIRT-related recommendations
given to patients by a primary care provider (PCP). The success of SBIRT (Screening, Brief Intervention, and
Referral to Treatment) in the primary care setting has been inconsistent in terms of patients following through
on treatment referral recommendations, with averages as low as 10%. For a variety of reasons, many patients,
irrespective of their specific disease, do not adhere well to clinical recommendations. One way to improve
adherence has been to personalize the recommendations for each individual’s needs, especially using digital
technology, such as apps. The aim of NIDA to develop a sophisticated smart phone based tool for improving
patient follow up to SBIRT recommendations is therefore well justified.
CHESS Health has already developed an automated digital tool (eIntervention) with key elements requested
by this RFA. eIntervention is designed to encourage patient adherence to PCP recommendations following
SBIRT. Using a variety of the RFA required functionalities, eIntervention is designed to facilitate and motivate
each patient to enter treatment, once that patient has been identified by SBIRT as having a substance use
disorder (SUD) or as being at risk of such. eIntervention is commercially available and was developed in
response to customer requests. However, eIntervention does not contain all of the functionalities requested by
NIDA in this RFA and we do not have data to validate efficacy. Such validation is important for supporting wide
spread dissemination. We propose to enhance our existing eIntervention solution with new functionalities that
address the requirements set forth in this RFA and carry out a randomized study of efficacy.
In Phase I, our Specific Aim is to evaluate feasibility of our program for improving adherence to SBIRT
recommendations to patients from PCPs. This Specific Aim will be accomplished in two Tasks:
Task 1: Add functionality to our prototype that address most requirements outlined in the RFA.
Task 2: Demonstrate acceptability, feasibility, and preliminary efficacy of the prototype eIntervention in
improving patient linkage to and engagement in indicated follow-up specialty SUD care.
If shown to be feasible, in Phase II, our Specific Aim is to evaluate a near commercial quality product that
contains all of the features required by the RFA. The Specific Aim will be accomplished in two Tasks:
Task 1: Modifications to the program (months 1-3).
Task 2: The randomized clinical trial to test efficacy of SBIRT/eIntervention compared to SBIRT/TAU.
Criteria for Success: We aim to double the current rate of follow-up specialty SUD care (e.g. go from ~17% to
an achieved rate of ~35%), a highly impactful effect. All patients, including those identified as at risk, must
show a reduction in substance use. Patients and PCPs must rank the program with an average of 3.5 on a
five-point Likert scale for usability, satisfaction, and willingness to use with the program again.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Periodontitis is initiated by oral bacteria, but quickly transits to an inflammatory immune disease with loss of host-
bacterial homeostasis. Homeostasis, the symbiotic balance between host tissues and the resident periodontal
microbiome is disrupted by a dysregulated immune response. From symbiosis to dysbiosis, early innate immune
components are robustly linked. At the host-microbial interface, we have ample evidence that microbes trigger
the immune response but lack knowledge of how the immune response regulates the composition and functional
activity of the microbiome. Specialized Pro-resolving Mediators (SPMs) are a family of eicosanoid lipid mediators
that bind to specific cell receptors to coordinate the return of an inflammatory lesion to homeostasis. Among the
many SPMs, E-series resolvins are naturally occurring metabolites of transformation circuits of the omega-3 fatty
acid, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), that actively induce resolution of inflammation. Activation of the Resolvin E1
(RvE1) receptor (ERV1) in gain-of-function studies with the ERV1 transgenic mouse (ERV1tg), show profound
resistance to periodontitis. The use of resolvins to control inflammation allows us to test our central hypothesis
that early immune activation directly contributes to the development of periodontal dysbiosis, which can be re-
versed/prevented by activating Resolivin-E1 mediated resolution of inflammation pathways. To test this hypoth-
esis, we break our investigations into two levels. First, in a murine model, we will characterize the oral microbi-
ome’s functional and spatial organizational changes as symbiosis transits to dysbiosis. Second, we will use an
in vitro system to unravel the mechanisms that determine how RvE1 and its receptor (ERV1) influence the dy-
namics of dysbiosis and inflammatory/immune responses in periodontitis. The candidate is a DDS/PhD perio-
dontist who is committed to an academic career dedicated to improving periodontal and oral health. The men-
tored phase of the proposal will be carried out with Dr. Thomas Van Dyke (Primary mentor) and Dr. Xuesong He
(Co-mentor) at the Forsyth Institute. The goal of the K99 phase is to provide additional training, mentoring, and
experience in three important areas 1) advanced bioinformatics training for microbiome data; 2) study design
and biostatistics training; and 3) career development. A strong Scientific Advisory Committee from the Forsyth
Institute, Harvard Medical School, and the University of Washington has been established with diverse expertise
in immunology, microbiology, bioinformatics, and statistics to help guide the candidate providing a training plan
that complements and expands her scientific background with mentors whose expertise spans the broad scope
of the scientific problem. The scientific component and training outlined in this proposal provide a pathway for
the candidate to transit to an independent research career in a tenure track faculty position independent of the
research programs of the mentors. Successful completion of this project will lead to better understanding of
host-microbiome interactions and how to gain control of the inflammation/dysbiosis cycle in periodontitis to ame-
liorate disease.

The work proposed in this application is a supplement to the work Charles River Analytics is already
conducting under our NIDA-funded SBIR (through a fast-track application) entitled Novel, On-demand VR for
Accessible, Practical, and Engaging therapy (NO VAPE) (Grant # 1R44DA059018-01). Aim 2 of NO VAPE is
to Solicit Feedback from Payors and FDA. To support positive coverage decisions by payors and meet FDA
standards for medical device clearance, we will conduct at least five interviews with payors (Milestone 2a) and
hold one FDA presubmission meeting (Milestone 2b) to finalize the design of the human factors evaluations
and the Phase II clinical trial.
If we are not accepted, we will contact payors on our own and conduct at least five interviews with companies
such as Aetna, BlueCross/BlueShield, Cigna, Clover Health, Kaiser Permanente, and United Health Group (all
of whom participate in the early payor feedback program). If we are accepted into I-Corps, we will use the
resources to increase this goal and will conduct 100 total discovery interviews with potential customers,
strategic partners, and other third-party stakeholders.
While NO VAPE focuses on providing an immersive and engaging platform for individuals to practice cognitive
behavioral therapy (CBT) skills to quit vaping, Charles River’s long-term strategic goal is to become the
preeminent supplier of metaverse tools for treatment of substance dependence (e.g., nicotine, alcohol,
stimulants) and mental health issues (e.g., PTSD, OCD). Participation in the I-Corps Program will provide us
with multiple opportunities to improve our approach to the commercialization of our NO VAPE platform, as well
as our other metaverse tools.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Development of radiation medical countermeasures (MCM) has become a national security priority owing to
such threats as radiological dispersal devices (i.e., “dirty bomb”) and nuclear accidents, which may be caused
by extreme weather (such as occurred in Fukushima, Japan in 2011). Radiation exposure can be potentially
lethal via the hematopoietic-acute radiation syndrome (H-ARS) and the gastrointestinal-ARS (GI-ARS). The
U.S. government has committed to supporting development of medical countermeasures (MCMs) to mitigate
morbidity and mortality of these radiation syndromes. Re-purposed leukemia drugs have proven useful in
treatment of the H-ARS in preclinical models, but there remains no effective MCM for GI-ARS.
Ceramedix, Inc. is developing a pipeline of therapeutic candidates with the goal of preventing and
mitigating illness due to radiation exposure. Our lead candidate, CX-01, is an anti-ceramide single-chain
variable antibody fragment (scFv) that binds ceramide on the exocellular leaflet of the plasma membrane of
radiation-injured endothelial cells in the GI tract and in other organs. By binding ceramide, ceramide-rich
platforms are disrupted, thereby preventing cellular death. Extensive data in multiple species, including non-
human primates (NHPs), show that disrupting the ceramide signaling pathway protects and mitigates the GI-
ARS. We have demonstrated dose-dependent efficacy in NHPs as well as mortality benefits in mice. CX-01
may be administered subcutaneously, a critical advantage during mass casualty events.
Ceramedix’ therapeutics may have broad application in multiple additional diseases. Ceramide-rich
platform signaling is a ubiquitous damage response pathway that drives cell injury and death in response to
diverse disease and environmental stimuli. Ceramedix has generated significant preclinical data supporting
treatment of diabetic retinopathy and diabetic macular edema. Ceramedix is also exploring other diseases
including diabetic nephropathy and pulmonary injury (fibrosis and other pulmonary syndromes).
The overall goal of this work is to validate that CX-01 demonstrates equivalent potency and efficacy as a
precursor non-humanized scFv molecule. We will perform in vitro and in vivo pharmacological studies to
support CX-01 IND acceptance.
The ability to prevent and treat GI-ARS would have profound benefits in protecting civilians and defense
personnel. There is no current treatment for GI-ARS, particularly one suitable for field administration following
a mass casualty event. USG has prioritized this critical unmet medical need.
CX-01 represents a major breakthrough in potential treatment of the lethal GI-ARS. CX-01 has the
potential to become the first and only available treatment for GI-ARS. Successful completion of this work will
accelerate IND submission and clinical evaluation of Ceramedix’ transformative therapeutic platform.

There is a consensus that chronic pain is a widespread major health problem and that development of better
drugs is needed to address this unmet need and combat the opioid abuse crisis. The pain crisis is particularly
burdensome for patients with severe pain, many of whom are on opioids, and have failed all other measures.
These patients may be candidates for a simple, but elegant alternative, namely intrathecal (IT) drug delivery
using an FDA approved fully implantable pump. The dose level with IT delivery is orders of magnitude less
than what is required for systemic delivery which greatly improves the safety margin. The FDA has approved
only two pain drugs for these micro-infusion devices, morphine and ziconotide. Though helpful in many
patients, side effects, safety issues, and inadequate efficacy limit their use. CNTX-3001 is a novel, non-opioid,
highly potent (picomolar Ki and EC50), highly selective small molecule agonist of the nociceptin receptor
(NOPr). Preclinical data in multiple species, including non-human primates, indicate that NOPr agonists are
powerful analgesics when delivered directly to the spinal cord by IT administration. The goal of this proposal is
to develop CNTX-3001 by conducting IND-enabling studies and a first-in-human Phase 1 trial. To be effective,
NOPr agonists must be applied directly to the region of the spinal cord because activation of brain NOPr
receptors may enhance pain. By contrast, IT NOPr agonists show no behavioral side effects at therapeutic
dose levels in preclinical studies (including non-human primates). CNTX-3001 possesses favorable
physiochemical properties for IT delivery, including an ideal balance of water solubility (for delivery to CSF) and
lipid solubility (for local distribution into the spinal cord). When delivered via bolus to the lumbar spinal cord of
rats, CNTX-3001 is powerfully analgesic with efficacy and behavioral side effect profiles superior to the gold-
standard FDA-approved option, IT morphine. The goal will be to develop CNTX-3001 for chronic IT delivery
using an approved pump. This grant will allow us to scale up production of drug substance (DS), undertake
formulation development, and run stability studies to ensure a stable drug product (DP) for IT delivery. We will
produce GMP-grade DS and DP and run non-GLP and GLP toxicity studies in two preclinical species. Data
from these studies will lead to a Phase 1 study evaluating tolerability and efficacy in patients with intractable
chronic low back pain (IT delivery is not appropriate for healthy volunteers). Results from this grant will lay the
groundwork for further clinical development (Phase 2 and 3 trials) using implantable pumps for continuous
delivery of CNTX-3001. We believe that Centrexion's IT drug candidate, CNTX-3001, has the capacity to
revolutionize management of severe pain in patients with few or no other options.

Critical self-judgment is a common phenomenon underlying a wide range of psychological disorders. The
proposed project aims to investigate the neural mechanism of critical self-judgment by analyzing fMRI and
questionnaire data from a total of 203 subjects collected from 5 previous projects that all included mindfulness
or compassion-based interventions for various conditions, e.g., depression, anxiety, trauma, stress and chronic
pain. The analyses will particularly evaluate the effective and functional connectivity among the amygdala, the
hippocampus, inferior frontal gyrus and precuneus, to test the central hypothesis that critical self-judgment is
characterized by excessive influence from negative valence on the left Inferior Frontal Gyrus-Pars Triangularis
(IFGPT), a key area for internal speech and self-awareness, which further influences the precuneus (PCu) of
the default mode network (DMN), a neural circuitry that supports self-referential processes.
Aim 1: To elucidate the effective connectivity in the neural circuitry during critical self-judgment. Using
fMRI data from a self-reappraisal task that included self-critical vs. self-reassurance conditions, Granger
Causality analysis will be conducted with fMRI time series from regions of interest of the hypothesized neural
circuitry to test whether there is significant effective connectivity in the directions of amygdala→IFGPT and
IFGPT→PCu during self-critical condition. Similar analyses with the self-reassurance condition will test whether
there is significant effective connectivity in the direction of MPFC→amygdala and IFGPT→amygdala, reflecting
frontal inhibition of negative affect.
Aim 2: To identify features from resting state fMRI that are associated with trait critical self-judgment.
Through analyzing resting state fMRI data with the CONN toolbox, we will extract Resting State Functional
Connectivity (RSFC) from regions of interest in the proposed neural circuitry, then use linear mixed effects
models to test whether the severity of trait critical self-judgment is collectively predicted by RSFC of
hippocampus-IFGPT, amygdala-IFGPT, IFGPT-PCu, hippocampus-PCu and amygdala-PCu.
Aim 3: To investigate whether post-intervention changes in trait critical self-judgment are predicted by
changes in the proposed neural circuitry. By analyzing post-intervention changes in fMRI metrics and trait
critical self-judgment severity, we will test whether post-intervention changes in trait critical self-judgment are
predicted by post-intervention changes in RSFC of hippocampal-IFGPT, amygdala-IFGPT, IFGPT-PCu,
hippocampus-PCu and amygdala-PCu.

 Despite much progress in mapping genetic associations for T2D, its complications, and related traits,
the underlying causal variants, effector genes, and gene networks are not well understood. The AMP-T2D
consortium aims to accelerate the pace by which these disease mechanisms are elucidated, through
generation and integration of novel genomic data interrogating genetic associations. This project addresses
RFA-DK-19-505 “Limited Competition for the Accelerating Medicines Partnership (AMP) in Type 2 Diabetes
Knowledge Portal (UM1)” and will be conducted by the leaders of the current AMP T2D Knowledge Portal
(T2DKP). Its goal is to continue development of the T2DKP by enhancing its infrastructure to aggregate,
analyze, and visualize genetic and genomic datasets and results, thereby helping to identify causal risk
variants and effector genes for T2D and its complications.
 The goal of specific aim 1 is to enhance the data and knowledge base for the T2DKP. It will enhance
the T2DKP software platform to represent additional classes of ‘omic and phenotypic data, integrate datasets
relevant to AMP-T2D within a federated data warehouse, develop new methods and analytical pipelines to
analyze these data, and enable them to be accessed by download or application programming interfaces
(APIs). The goal of specific aim 2 is to enhance the publicly accessible T2DKP web interface. It will develop
new web modules to visualize datasets within the T2DKP, extend the T2DKP with tools from external public
genomic databases, maintain curated knowledge lists for T2D and its complications, allow users to customize
data and tools shown within the T2DKP, and update the T2DKP in response to stakeholder feedback. The goal
of specific aim 3 is to coordinate the AMP-T2D consortium. It will provide operational support for AMP-T2D
investigators, foster collaborations with external partners, track and ensure the timely release of AMP-T2D
datasets, administer an opportunity pool to fund additional AMP-T2D projects, and conduct outreach and
training on the T2DKP.
 Significance: The project would extend the T2DKP with new capabilities to integrate and display
datasets with information regarding causal variants, effector transcripts, and gene networks for T2D and its
complications. Public access to these data and results will significantly accelerate efforts to identify new
therapeutic strategies to prevent, treat, or reverse T2D and its complications.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
In this proposal we aim to identify gene regulatory elements that permit the targeting and manipulation of brain
circuit models of human brain function. Gaining genetic access to specific neuron populations in nontransgenic
animals and humans would enable targeted circuit modulation for hypothesis testing and provide a means to
evaluate the safety and efficacy of circuit modulation for the treatment of epilepsy and psychiatric disorders. Our
approach capitalizes on our combined expertise in the development and maturation of brain cell-types and
circuits (Gord Fishell), identification of CIS-regulatory elements that function across species (Jordane
Dimidschstein) and AAV engineering combined with large-scale screening methods (Ben Deverman). Our efforts
will benefit from an ongoing collaboration with John Reynolds at the Salk Institute on observation and
manipulation of cortical circuits during complex visual perception tasks. This project will build upon success that
we and others have had in identifying gene regulatory elements that enable cell type-restricted gene expression
when used within recombinant adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors. Identifying additional enhancer sequences
that function in the context of the limited carrying capacity of AAV has been slow due to the limited success rate
and low throughput nature of these efforts. Here we aim to apply a novel high-throughput screening approach
for the rapid identification of a suite of enhancers that enable the study and manipulation of genetically defined
cell types and circuits across species. Our preliminary data demonstrates that our enhancer identification
strategy can yield novel and highly specific enhancers that restrict expression to target populations. In addition,
we have demonstrated that it is possible to use the engineered AAV-PHP.eB capsid to screen enhancers across
the brain with a single noninvasive injection. These successes have highlighted the need for more rapid and
comprehensive assessment of putative enhancers. In the UH3 portion of this proposal we will examine the
tolerance to neuronal activity manipulation within the target neuronal populations in several species. We will also
apply the AAV-enhancer viruses for querying disease-related circuits using Rabies tracing in conjunction with
optogenetics. This proposal will be transformative in devising methods to target and manipulate the brain activity
of specific neuronal cell populations across species, including human cell-derived organoids.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Inflammation negatively affects Tregs stability and suppressive function, impairs the
induction of solid organ transplant tolerance and enhances acute and chronic rejection, leading
to worse recipients’ long-term outcomes. Insights into key inflammatory pathways that suppress
Tregs during allo-immune activation can revolutionize our therapeutic approach to promoting
stable endogenous Tregs.
 Our work strongly suggests that an inflammatory cytokine, macrophage migration
inhibitory factor (MIF), secreted by myeloid cells and alloreactive T cells during rejection and
inflammation binds CD74 (MIF receptor) on the surface of activated Tregs to dampen its function
and homeostasis with opposite effect on alloreactive T cells. We show that inhibiting this novel
pathway either through monoclonal antibodies or genetic deletion promotes immune regulation
and induce exhaustion of alloreactive T cells leading to indefinite heart allograft survival in a
murine fully mismatched model. MIF is a potent pro-inflammatory cytokine produced and released
by immune cells, particularly macrophages, and plays an integral role in innate immunity.
However, its role in adaptive immunity is not well known and will be investigated. Our data show
that graft infiltrating Tregs and Teff upregulate their expression of MIF receptor CD74. However,
graft infiltrating myeloid cells and Teff but not Tregs secrete MIF. MIF then binds to CD74 on
Tregs surface to suppress and on Teff to promote their function.
 Our single cell transcriptomic analysis, TCR sequencing, flow cytometry and functional
assays showed that CD74 deficient graft infiltrating Tregs reduced Interferon regulatory factor 1
(IRF1) and shifted toward a more stable Treg phenotype that exhibits superior suppressive ability
in vitro and in vivo. IRF1 is a negative regulator of Foxp3 transcriptional activity that contributes
significantly to Treg instability in the setting of inflammation. Interestingly, CD74 signaling is
exerted through its intracellular-domain (ICD), shown to bind to transcription factors to modulate
gene expression. Recent work identified IRF1 as one of the binding TFs for CD74-ICD13.
 In this application we will test the hypothesis that a novel inflammatory pathway in which
MIF produced by myeloid cells and Teff suppresses Treg function through IRF1 mediated CD74
signaling (SA1), while promoting the Teff function (SA2). We will also develop a clinically relevant
strategy to dampen the MIF mediated inflammatory process in the allograft using anti-CD74
monoclonal antibody generated in our lab (SA3). This anti-mouse CD74 is equivalent to the FDA
approved human anti CD74 (milatuzumab). Hence, this work has high translation potentials.

part of the virulence, and as supported by their underlying metabolism. Commensal metabolism
in the gut provides an opportunity to impede these processes by depriving pathogens of growth-
promoting nutrients. Using the amino acid and carbohydrate-fermenting pathogen Clostridioides
difficile, we will evaluate how redox metabolism of target carbon sources by the pathogen and
commensals can enhance or limit its ability to colonize and infect the gut. Analyses will leverage
innovative approaches to track nutrient flow among pathogen, commensal, and host tissues.
Studies will further perturb host environments using carbon sources that are fermented by the
pathogen, protective commensals, or both, to assess their role in disease pathogenesis and
progression. Findings will inform small molecule and bacteriotherapeutic interventions in disease

computational models of homeostatic regulation of intrinsic excitability (Project #4 of
P01 NS07949). Together these projects comprise a coherent attempt to understand
brain circuit stability in the face of: a) extensive neuromodulation, b) constant and rapid
turnover of ion channels and receptors, and c) degenerate and multiple solutions at the
single neuron and circuit level. These questions arise from years of computational and
experimental work using the small circuits of the crustacean stomatogastric ganglion
(STG), but address general problems relevant to all nervous systems, from invertebrates
to humans. Future experiments will combine experimental and computational work to
understand the correlations in biological parameters in neurons and networks that allow
any given parameter to be variable while the circuit itself retains robustness. Animal to
animal variability in response to perturbations will be measured, the strengths of all of
the synapses in STG circuits will be measured, and the regulation of multiple
neuromodulator receptors by single neurons will be studied. Additionally, self-tuning
models will be developed to find sets of neuronal parameters that allow neurons to
maintain stability in response to perturbations. This work will illuminate the extent to
which the same animal can potentially generate similar behavior by substantially
different (degenerate) circuit mechanisms at different times. If so, this can shed light on
how larger circuits may switch between a number of degenerate circuit mechanisms to
generate stable behaviors over time.

The overall goal of the NIGMS-funded research in my lab is to define the molecular and cellular mechanisms
underlying dynamic rearrangements of the actin cytoskeleton, and to explore how these mechanisms are
harnessed in vivo (in yeast and animal cells) to control diverse actin-based processes such as cell motility,
endocytosis, intracellular transport, and cell morphogenesis. Genetic and biochemical research has been
rapidly producing a ‘molecular parts list’ for the actin cytoskeleton, and many of the components have been
characterized individually for their biochemical effects on actin filaments and their genetic effects on cellular
actin organization and function. However, it is becoming clear that most of these proteins do not function alone,
but rather in groups to perform their biological roles, and thus, new approaches are needed to define how they
work in concert to perform their cellular functions. Our lab is tackling this problem using advanced single
molecule TIRF microscopy to directly observe multi-component actin regulatory mechanisms in real time, and
testing these mechanisms using genetic, cell biological, biochemical, and structural approaches. Through this
approach, we have made fundamental new insights into actin regulation. For instance, we defined the first
collaborative actin nucleation mechanisms of formins (with Bud6 & APC). We discovered that formins and
Capping Protein can bind simultaneously at filament ends to accelerate each other’s dissociation. We showed
that Cofilin, AIP1, and Coronin work together via an ordered mechanism to sever and disassemble F-actin. We
discovered that Srv2/CAP works in conjunction with Cofilin and Twinfilin to depolymerize filament ends. In
parallel, we have combined genetics, cellular imaging, and separation-of-function mutants to dissect the
contributions of these mechanisms to actin-based processes in yeast and mammalian cells.
Moving forward, we will ask the following questions: what are the complete regulatory cycles of the two yeast
formins (Bni1 and Bnr1)? How is Arp2/3 complex-mediated actin nucleation balanced by its inhibitors (Coronin
and GMF) and activators (Las17/WASP and Abp1)? How is actin nucleation at the leading edge of motile cells
controlled by interactions among IQGAP1, APC and formins? How do interactions at filament ends between
Capping Protein and formins (and their in vivo binding partners) control actin network growth? How do the
filament severing and depolymerization mechanisms (Cofilin, AIP1, Coronin, Twinfilin, and Srv2/CAP) drive net
disassembly of actin under the assembly-promoting conditions of the cytosol? Are there actin-associated
proteins that accelerate the nucleotide state transition on F-actin to promote disassembly? In addition, we will
introduce new technologies and directions to our research, including in vitro reconstitution of cellular actin
structures, cryo-EM to study protein structure, cell-free extracts to genetically-biochemically dissect actin
mechanisms, and a systems-level approach to determine how genetic disruptions in individual actin regulators
affect the cellular levels, localization, and functions of the remaining actin-associated proteins.

The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is one of the most important model organisms for biomedical
research, because of its biological tractability and because much of its physiology and behavior relies
on signaling pathways that are conserved in humans. The goal of this project is to complement the
highly developed genomics and genetics of C. elegans with a comprehensive structural and functional
characterization of its metabolome. In recent work we have shown that C. elegans utilizes small-
molecule architectures of unanticipated diversity and complexity in endocrine and exocrine signaling
that control almost every aspect of its life history, including development, aging, stress resistance, and
a wide range of behaviors. One major focus of our investigations is the elucidation of the biosynthesis
and perception mechanisms of newly identified small molecule signals, which will reveal how
metabolism and conserved signaling pathways interact to control phenotypes. Of particular interest
are (i) the roles of recently identified endogenous agonists of the nuclear receptor NHR-49, a key
regulator of lipid metabolism and functional ortholog of vertebrate PPARα, (ii) male germline-
dependent metabolites that accelerate development and aging via conserved pathways, including
homologs of mammalian steroid receptors, and (iii) our recent discovery of a modular glucosides that
appear to function as a “second layer” of neurotransmitter signaling. In addition, we will investigate the
biological functions of a new family of nucleoside derivatives we discovered that may interact with
purinergic signaling. Another focus area will be the influence of dietary bacteria on C. elegans small
molecule signaling, motivated by our discovery of unexpected roles for bacterial metabolites, e.g. in
modulating fat metabolism via NHR-49 or in serotonin signaling. Central to the proposed research is
the use of synthetic samples and derivatives of identified signaling molecules for bioassays, mutant
screens, and transcriptomic studies, as well as the in-house developed metabolomics platform
(Metaboseek), which greatly accelerates compound identification and functional annotation.
Successful conclusion of this project will provide a structural and functional annotation small molecule
signaling networks in C. elegans, substantially increasing our understanding of conserved pathways
that control development, aging and metabolism, as well as corresponding disease-relevant pathways
in mammals. The small-molecule knowledge generated will not only enable future efforts aimed at
more varied chemical genetic screens exploring additional aspects of the biology and ecology of C.
elegans, but also of nematode species relevant in agriculture or medicine. Furthermore, methodology
developed for characterizing C. elegans signaling molecules will facilitate similar studies toward
structural and functional characterization of small molecule metabolites from other model organisms.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
Both inputs to the brain and outputs from the brain occur over a broad range of timescales and
in many cases repeat rhythmically. Rhythmic changes in gene expression have been studied
in the brain only in the context of circadian rhythms. Additionally, shorter-than-a-day (ultradian)
rhythms have been sparsely reported and it is unknown how these rhythms originate,
particularly at the molecular level and whether they interact and/or share part of the
timekeeping machinery utilized by the circadian clock. Understanding how these rhythms are
generated and maintained will illuminate new aspects of brain gene expression and physiology
and open unexplored areas of research.
In an effort to reveal RNA oscillations at different timescales in the fly brain, we profiled fly brains
by RNAseq every two hours for three days. By analyzing these data, we identified dozens of
RNAs oscillating with 6-, 12-, and 24-hour rhythms in the brain. Interestingly, enrichment
analysis shows that more than half of these genes are highly expressed in the glia, suggesting
this cell type has oscillators operating at different timescales. The importance and novelty
of these results are two-fold: a. they demonstrate, for the first time, the presence of ultradian
RNA oscillations in the fly brain; b. suggest the existence of oscillators operating at
different timescales (circadian and ultradian) in the glial cells. In this context, the present
proposal aims to comprehensively identify the mechanisms responsible for ultradian
rhythmic gene expression in the glial cells within the fly brain. Our work will shed light on
new mechanisms of ultradian expression in flies for the first time. In addition, we will identify
and characterize new timekeeping or timer-like mechanisms operating in glial cells that also
have a circadian clock. Last, our work will provide new information and lead to developing tools
to perturb and investigate these rhythms in the future.
In sum, we are convinced that this project will uncover new modes of timed regulation of
transcription and physiology within the brain, which might be of vast importance beyond
Drosophila and uncover potential connections between ultradian and circadian oscillators
within these cells. This pioneering study will set the stage for further studying the role of
oscillations in the glia, a key cell type in the brain, as well as to understand the mechanism and
role of ultradian rhythms in general. As circadian rhythms have been linked to numerous diseases
including depression and sleep disorders, the present proposal has obvious implications for
human health.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：The goal of this proposal is to better characterize the cognitive and neural basis of face perception
heterogeneity in developmental prosopagnosia (DP) and to test whether potential perceptual subtypes are
better suited for one type of cognitive training program vs. another. This is relevant to the National Eye
Institute's mission to better treat visual disorders and understand mechanisms of visual function. Our pilot
results (N=45 DPs) provide preliminary evidence that there are perceptually-impaired (PI-DPs) and
perceptually-unimpaired (PU-DPs) DP subgroups that may be mechanistically distinct. We find that PI-DPs
have deficient eye processing, reduced holistic processing abilities, reduced N170 response to eye contrast-
reversed faces, and a trend towards decreased white matter integrity in the occipital face area, a face-selective
region involved in face parts processing. We also find that PI-DPs, compared to PU-DPs, show a greater
treatment response to our computerized face perception training program. The goals of the current proposal
are to build on these pilot results to further test and validate the PI-DP vs. PU-DP subgroup distinction, to
better understand the neural mechanisms underlying perceptual heterogeneity in DPs, and to examine
treatment implications of potential subgroups. In particular, our aims for this proposal are to: 1) Collect a large
sample of web-based and in-lab DPs (N=280) and controls (N=140) and replicate our pilot findings showing
eye processing and holistic processing deficits in PI-DPs. We will also perform latent profile analysis to
determine if DPs naturally form PI-DP vs. PU-DP subgroups or rather represent a continuum of face
perception deficits. 2) Characterize the neural mechanisms of DP face perception heterogeneity using
functional fMRI, EEG, and diffusion tensor imaging in 80 DPs and 40 controls. To test better understand the
neural underpinnings of DPs' reduced eye region sensitivity and reduced holistic processing, we seek examine
the N170 event-related potential response to isolated eyes vs. mouths as well as face inversion and for fMRI,
population receptive fields of face-selective regions as well as responses to isolated mouths and eyes. We will
also examine whether PI-DPs vs. PU-DPs have white matter integrity differences in face-selective white matter
regions. 3) Determine whether PI-DPs vs. PU-DPs have differential responses to face perception training, face
memory training, or face perception+face memory training programs. This will involve a longitudinal study of
120 DPs being assigned to either a waitlist control condition or 6 weeks of one of the three cognitive training
programs. Before and after training/waiting, we will assess DPs on a validated battery of face perception and
recognition tests as well as self-reported face recognition. To measure the longevity of potential training
effects, DPs will also repeat assessments after a 6-week no-contact period.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Brain photobiomodulation (PBM) using near-infrared (NIR) light is a promising new approach for treating
Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Despite the high interest in using PBM to treat AD, its application is currently
hindered by the insufficient understanding of the mechanisms of NIR light actions in the brain.
Additionally, NIR-I light (650-900 nm) has not achieved clinical significance due to its insufficient
penetration into the brain tissue. We hypothesize that the key mechanisms underlying treatment
properties of NIR light in AD include the activation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) in the
brain, increase of nitric oxide (NO) production by endothelial cells, vasomotion, increase of glymphatic
flow, and reduction of amyloid β load and tau pathology. Further, we hypothesize that these
mechanisms can be markedly enhanced by the pulsation of NIR-II light (1000-1700 nm) at a low
frequency during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. Our specific aims are designed to test the key
elements of this hypothesis. We plan to test that NIR light treatment is most efficient when it is delivered
in NIR-II window and during NREM sleep (aim 1), that the rate of NIR light stimulation rather than its
duration determines the efficiency of the PBM treatment in AD (aim 2), and that eNOS is the key
mediator of therapeutic effects of NIR light in AD, whereas neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) is not
(aim 3). Thus, we propose a series of translational studies that are aimed to improve our understanding
or the role of NIR light in reducing the AD pathology as well as to identify the way of NIR light delivery
that is most efficient in treating AD.

Cancer mortality rates in the US declined by 26% between 1991 and 2015, but the decline has not been equal
across all populations. Approximately 19% of the US population resides in rural areas; for over three decades,
this population has experienced increasingly inferior outcomes when compared with their urban counterparts.
The underlying cause(s) of the widening rural/urban gap in cancer outcomes is hypothesized to be multifactorial,
with socioeconomic status (SES) both at the individual-level and geographic area-level likely playing a significant
role. Gaps in evidence include the use of multiple “rural” definitions, a lack of evidence on associated geographic
factors, and limited evidence based on multi-level approaches to understand the complex nature of rural
disparities. Therefore, the overall objective of this study is to conduct a comprehensive examination of the
underlying causes of rural/urban disparities in mortality among individuals diagnosed with cancer. In the first aim,
the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) population-level data will be used to examine mortality
among individuals diagnosed with cancer across three definitions of rurality, providing researchers and policy
makers with the magnitude of differences by each definition. In the second aim, SEER will be linked via county-
indicators to 16 databases (US Census Bureau, Area Deprivation Index, Bureau of Labor Statistics, County
Health Rankings and Roadmaps, AMA Healthcare Workforce Mapper, BRFSS, Social Vulnerability Index, Health
Information National Trends Survey, etc.). These linkages will allow us to estimate the contribution of specific area-
level factors (e.g., area-level SES, access to high-quality care) on rural/urban mortality differences using effect
decomposition methodology. In the third aim, the Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke
(REGARDS) cohort (U01 NS041588) will be linked to state level cancer registry data using the Virtual Pooled
Registry Cancer Linkage System (VPR-CLS). REGARDS includes longitudinally collected data for 30,239
participants (44% blacks), oversampled from stroke belt/buckle states (56% of participants from NC, SC, GA,
TN, AL, MS, AK, LA) with large rural populations experiencing the highest mortality. REGARDS collects
information at the individual level on sociodemographics, health literacy, and distance to healthcare,
transportation, and risky health behaviors. Multi-level modeling and mediation modeling approaches will allow for
the examination of the contribution of individual-level characteristics and the area-level characteristics simultaneously.
Results will provide estimates of how much of the mortality disparity is explained by differences in urban and
rural geographic characteristics overall as well estimates that describe the potential impact of hypothetical
interventions on specific mediating factors. Findings will provide the critical evidence needed to inform policy and
intervention development aimed at addressing the systemic disparities in mortality experienced by rural patients
with cancer.

Lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) is a nuclear histone demethylase. Our work shows that LSD1 expression
progressively increases with tumor grade and stage in clinical oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Our long-
term goal is to evaluate LSD1 mechanism in progressive oral malignancy based on preliminary studies for
therapeutic applications. Recent preliminary studies showed that conditional LSD1 deletion in the tongue
epithelium during dysplasia reduced invasive pathological lesions, downregulated EGFR, YAP-induced signaling
network, and Pd-L1 expression. Next, the topical application of LSD1 inhibitor during dysplasia prevented its
progression to invasive phenotype, attenuated pathological lesions, expression of Hippo signaling effectors (Yap,
Taz, Ccn2,) and immune checkpoints (Pd-1, and Pd-l1). LSD1 inhibitor sensitized OSCC to combinations with
either YAP inhibitor, anti-PD-1, or anti-PD-L1 antibodies, limiting tumor progression in vivo. Thus, we showed
for the first time that blocking LSD1 inhibits preneoplasia, a feed-forward loop during the progression of
dysplasia to OSCC. Interestingly, LSD1 inhibition attenuates IL-6-JAK-STAT3 novel signaling identified in two
independent studies 1) proteomics analysis of LSD knockout mice preneoplasia and 2) single-cell RNAseq
analysis using LSD1 inhibitor. However, the mechanism of LSD1 function, its target cells in progressive oral
malignancy, and how LSD1 promotes IL-6-JAK-STAT3 remain unclear. This knowledge gap prevents the
targeted design of effective new epigenetic therapeutic strategies for OSCC. We hypothesize that (1) LSD1
upregulation during dysplasia reprograms oral tissue to invasive phenotype by acting on IL6 -signaling and
induced cell types and (2) pharmacological attenuation of LSD1 reset epigenome to reverse progressive
malignant preneoplasia to a noninvasive phenotype. Using clinically relevant animal models, this project is well-
positioned to address the following Specific Aims: 1) to determine how upregulated LSD1 epigenetically
reprogram dysplasia to promote IL6 network during progressive oral preneoplasia invasive phenotype; 2) to
determine if LSD1 collaborates with YAP to promote IL6-JAK-STAT3 network induced invasive phenotype in
preneoplasia, and 3) to determine the translational importance of pharmacological LSD1 inhibition reverse
preneoplasia by inhibiting IL6-JAK-STAT3 signaling induced cancer stem and immune cells. The successful
completion of the proposed project is expected to identify LSD1 and therapeutic application mechanisms in the
IL6-JAK-STAT3 network, related stem cells, and immune cells. Finally, the study will determine if LSD1 a role
in anti-PD-1 immunotherapy resistance and pharmacological LSD1 inhibition can attenuate feline OSCC for a
potential application in veterinary and human medicine. Overall, the study will have a broader impact on future
translational studies in human preneoplasia.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Co-occurring anxiety is prevalent in more than 50% of individuals with Opioid use disorder (OUD). This is of
major concern as safe and effective treatment options are lacking for this high-risk population. Anxiety in those
with OUD is linked to earlier and more rapid progression of OUD, and high probability of co-use of other
substances, particularly GABAA receptor positive modulators, such as benzodiazepines (BZDs). BZDs are
currently the standard of care treatment for fast-acting relief for general anxiety and panic disorder. Although
highly effective in the short-term, BZDs represent amajor, but often overlookedcontributorto the opioid overdose
epidemic. BZDs are involved in an estimated 12,000 overdose fatalities each year in the US, largely due to the
concomitant use with other CNS depressants, such as opioids. In fact, more than 90%of BZD overdose fatalities
involve opioids and up to 30% opioid overdoses involve BZDs. Additionally, BZD prescription rates are directly
linked to opioid overdose rates per state. With a lack of safe alternatives that can offer comparable efficacy, BZD
market predictions indicate their use will remain steady or increase globally. Thus, there is an urgent need to
develop safe and comparably effective alternatives to BZDs for those with OUD. We have discovered a novel
series of promising synthetic GABAAR active molecules Our lead molecule, RU-EC2-118, is a partial GABAAR
PAM with nanomolar potency at GABAAR subtypes and high oral bioavailability. Our in vivo studies in rodent
models, strongly support the potential for the mechanismof RUEC2-118 to provide effective fast-actinganxiolytic
activity and a safer profile with co-use with other CNS-depressing substances. The major technical aims of the
STTR parent grant is to provide proof-of-concept data supporting the feasibility of our approach in maintaining
efficacy and reducing overdoserisks. Specific aim3 is to test the desirability of our innovation through enrollment
in the NIH I-Corps program. Having previously completed the NSF National ICorps program, we successfully
validated the need for our innovation. During the NIH ICorps program, our main objective is to further investigate
the best pathways towards funding and commercialization of our innovation .

 The development of serial confocal and electron-microscopy (EM), and automated image
segmentation have allowed us to elucidate some of the structural details of the cortical circuit at the
cellular and synaptic level. This information is critical because there is a close link between the
morphological properties of circuits in different brain areas and their function. It is broadly accepted that
the canonical microcircuit of the cortex is a repeating motif across cortex. Once the structure and
function in the local motif is understood this could be applied across all of cortex. However, recently it
has been shown that there are major laminar, areal and species differences that need to be taken into
account by this model. Another important feature of the canonical circuit in sensory areas is that the
initial thalamocortical (TC) driving input to layer 4 in cortex, which was presumed to be weak, needs to
be massively amplified to obtain the observed rates of spiking. However, recent studies have shown
that the weak TC assumption, has underestimated the TC strength by 2-4 times. I hypothesis that,
although the canonical circuit may provide general framework for cortical circuit functioning, diverse
sensory brain areas have major laminar differences in their neuronal and synaptic distributions. These
differences will, in turn, reflect the diverse processing roles and capabilities of the brain areas. To test
this hypothesis I will examine three primary sensory areas in macaque monkey cortex using Focused
Ion Beam/Scanning EM to determine detailed synaptic connectivity, using high-resolution confocal
microscopy to provide large scale determination of specific synaptic connectivity, and using mid-
resolution confocal microscopy to determine global cell type distributions in specific brain regions. If, as
I hypothesize, there are major quantitative differences between areas that will reflect their diverse
processing roles and capabilities, this will call for a refinement of the concept of the canonical circuit.
These quantitative results are important to build realistic population based spiking models of cortex that
can reproduce many of the detailed functional characteristics that are found in the brain. They are also
important because understanding the basic cortical organization of the normal brain is essential, as it
provides the standard against which it can be judged which processes can be seen to be altered or
damaged in disorders that affect the cerebral cortex. Additionally, an important part of this project is my
professional development as a PI. As such, I have established a research enhancement plan to
increase my research scholarship and publications, with the final goal of acquiring non-SCORE
research support.

 Ethnic disparities represent a significant problem in modern dermatology, and additional efforts are required
to better understand mechanisms underlying the development of skin diseases in patients with skin of color.
 Inflammatory skin conditions (acne, atopic dermatitis, hidradenitis suppurativa) represent a group of
diseases, which disproportionally impact African American (AA) patients including children. Comparative
transcriptome analyses of the skin reveal higher expression of multiple inflammation-related genes in AA healthy
individuals compared to non-Hispanic White (NHW) individuals.
 Regulation of expression of the genes involved in inflammatory skin response occurs at several levels
including signaling/transcription factor-mediated and epigenetic mechanisms. Transposable elements (TEs) are
repetitive mobile segments of DNA that constitute 44%-55% of mouse or human genomes. Inappropriate TE
activation has been implicated in pathogenesis of over 120 human diseases including autoimmune disorders.
 Most TEs are transcriptionally inactive, while their aberrant activation result in a production of double-
stranded (ds) RNA and dsDNA triggering the dsRNA/DNA sensing mechanisms followed by anti-viral immune
response. In the epidermis, UV exposure activates transcription of endogenous retroviral sequences.
Endogenous retroviruses of the HERV-K and W families are significantly upregulated in psoriatic versus non-
lesional skin. However, contribution of TEs to regulation of skin inflammation in AA individuals remain unknown.
 In this Administrative Supplement application to AR078306-03 grant, we will test a hypothesis that aberrant
activation of TEs in epidermal keratinocytes serve as critical determinant driving inflammatory skin response in
individuals with understudied skin types, while pharmacological inhibition of the TE transcription with the
nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors provides a novel strategy for management of inflammatory skin
conditions in these individuals. This hypothesis will be addressed via two Specific Aims:
 1. Perform comparative analyses of the landscapes of transposable element expression in human
epidermal keratinocytes between understudied skin types and NHW skin and correlate these data with
gene expression and patterns of active/repressive covalent DNA/histone modifications.
 2. Define the effects of the inhibitors of dsRNA and dsDNA pathways on expression of inflammation-
associated genes in epidermal keratinocytes isolated from understudied skin types in 3D skin equivalent
culture and in experimental in vitro models of skin inflammation.
 The generated outputs from this application will provide novel insights into fundamental mechanisms
regulating inflammation in understudied human skin types, as well as will promote the development of novel
paradigms for management of skin inflammatory responses in humans via modulation of TE activities.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Black Americans are twice as likely as White Americans to have Alzheimer’s disease (AD), independent of
genetic risk. Despite this knowledge, little is known about whether and how chronic experiences of racism
contribute to medial temporal hippocampal (MTH) and prefrontal-executive system integrity, systems that
exhibit profound neurodegeneration in AD and vulnerability to chronic stress. Although comorbid illnesses and
socioeconomic status contribute to the AD health disparity, disparities remain. This highlights a critical unmet
need for understanding social and societal stressors to disparities in brain health. A major contributor to health
inequities in the U.S. is chronic stress due to the cumulative effects of racism over the lifetime. The impact of
chronic interpersonal and institutional/structural racism, unique and salient forms of chronic stress in Black
Americans, on the neurocognitive integrity of these brain systems is not well understood. Since perceived
racism contributes to health disparities in cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors, which are also risk factors
for AD, perceived racism should have a significant impact also on the AD health disparity. The objective of the
parent R01 grant is to investigate the impact of racism on 1) CVD risk and 2) neurocognitive MTH-memory and
prefrontal-executive system integrity in Black seniors and to examine potentially underlying biological
mechanisms. The research objective of this diversity supplement is to examine the impact of consequences of
structural racism on neurocognitive integrity, namely 1) acculturation, a social compensatory mechanism
defined as the incorporation of the cultural norms of the social majority within a society, and 2) lower education
quality, leading to poorer dementia-related health literacy and greater public stigma associated with AD. The
central hypothesis of the parent R01 grant is that cognitively healthy Black seniors who have experienced
higher levels of chronic racism will show greater CVD risk and poorer MTH and prefrontal integrity than those
who have experienced fewer instances of racism over their lifetime. CVD risk and mental health may mediate
(i.e., explain) the relationship between racism burden and neurocognitive integrity. This diversity supplement
extends the parent grant by examining the relationships between AD-related health literacy, and public stigma
associated with AD with cognitive and neuroimaging outcomes (Aim 1) and acculturation (Aim 2) with cognitive
and neuroimaging outcomes. Aim 3 is exploratory and will examine racism burden and public stigma as
moderators of the relationship between acculturation and neurocognitive outcomes. The proposed diversity
supplement is for the candidate to gain expertise in how proxies of anti-Black structural racism affect brain
health in older Black self-identifying adults. To achieve these goals, in addition to the research aims outlined
above, the candidate is proposing training in multimodal neuroimaging (i.e., structural and fMRI) and statistical
modeling, and advancing mastery of MTH- and prefrontal-dependent functions related to anti-Black
racism. This supplement will set up the candidate for success in independent neurocognitive aging research.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Alternative splicing (AS) of precursor mRNA provides an important means of genetic control and is a crucial
step in the expression of most genes. AS gives rise to multiple isoforms that can exhibit differential stabilities,
molecular binding capabilities, and phenotypic effects, thereby greatly expanding the functional capacity of
genes. These functions are frequently deregulated in human disease, leading to aberrantly expressed isoforms
that can act as drivers and “rewirers” of cellular pathways. Given the intrinsic role of AS in nearly every aspect
of biology, tools and technologies for the functional understanding of isoforms are desperately needed.
Unfortunately, prediction of isoform functions are notoriously difficult, due to our only crude understanding of
the molecular determinants of isoform activities as well as a paucity of experimental datasets annotated at
isoform resolution. The experiments, in turn, are challenging in their own right, due to a lack of robust methods
for the detection, mapping, and phenotyping at isoform-resolution in vivo. As a consequence, one of the
biggest gaps in the genomics and proteomics fields is an understanding the functional and evolutionary
implications of the astonishing complexity of the human proteome.
To make progress towards this gap, we must reformulate existing approaches. Here, we propose to build
computational and experimental methodologies that are intertwined across the entire development and
evaluation lifecycle. Computational approaches, capitalizing on ever-improving machine learning algorithms,
can predict the effect of AS at high coverage. Experimental validation, on the other hand, is critical to
benchmark the predictions as well as shed light on heretofore uncharacterized features of isoform functionality.
The goals of this project are to develop (i) a predictor of protein isoform stability, a “first line of evidence” and
prerequisite of isoform functionality, (ii) a novel bioinformatics approach to study the “rewiring” effects of AS
isoforms on protein interactions, and (iii) a novel measure, the alternative splicing impact factor, that predicts
the functional role of an isoform based on metrics such as the loss of interaction and expression patterns, and
apply this concept to determine AS-induced phenotypes in-silico and in vitro/vivo (cell-based assay). Each
computational stage will be closely complemented with a highly customized and novel experimental approach–
large-scale isoform proteogenomics, interactomics, and functional assays experiments–to validate and
benchmark the predictors, as well as feed into an iterative computation-experimental “virtuous cycle”.

This R21 proposal tests the hypothesis that environmental chemicals target microglia, the resident
immune cells in the brain and alterations in microglial function contributes to the risk of development
of neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders. Microglia play an important role in responding
to inflammation and immune challenge in the brain. They also have been shown to have a number of
important roles beyond immune response, including synaptic pruning during development and adult
neurogenesis. Microglial activation has been shown to be involved in the progression of different
neurodegenerative diseases as well as in several neuropsychiatric conditions. Accumulating evidence
suggests that environmental chemical exposure increases the susceptibility to the development of
various neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders. A majority of the studies investigating the
impacts of environmental chemical exposure on microglia have been conducted using in vitro cell
culture systems and very little is known about in vivo effects, especially during early life.
The proposed research is aimed at understanding the role of environmental chemical exposure on
microglial dysfunction in vivo in a well-established developmental model system using imaging,
molecular and behavioral approaches. It has two specific aims. In specific aim 1, we test the
hypothesis that exposure of zebrafish to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) causes microglial
activation. These studies will be conducted using a range of environmentally relevant concentrations
of PCB126, a dioxin-like PCB that is ubiquitously distributed in the environment. Using transgenic
zebrafish expressing cell-specific fluorescent markers and time-lapse confocal imaging, we will
measure microglial morphology in response to exposure. In addition, the potential effects of microglial
activation on neuronal network as well as neurobehaviors will be quantified. In specific aim 2, we will
test the hypothesis that PCB-induced microglia dysfunction is AHR dependent. Using AHR null
zebrafish, we will characterize the role of AHR in microglial activation. Wild type and AHR null
zebrafish will be exposed to a concentration of PCB126 that affected microglia and characterize the
effects both immediately after exposure and later in life. We will characterize the brain specific
transcriptional and epigenetic profiles associated with these changes using single cell RNA
sequencing and single cell DNA methylation profiling. The results from the proposed studies will
provide fundamental knowledge about the role of environmental chemicals on immune cells in the
brain.

The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) is a bHLH-PAS protein that in vertebrate animals is a ligand-activated
transcription factor that plays essential roles in the regulation of xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes and in the
mechanisms of toxicity of numerous environmental contaminants, including chlorinated dioxins such as
2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), some polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polynuclear aromatic
hydrocarbons (PAHs), and some emerging contaminants. The AHR is also involved in a variety of
physiological processes including development, hematopoiesis, immunity, host-microbiome interactions, and
barrier organ function. In contrast to most ligand-activated transcription factors that have narrow ligand-
specificity, the vertebrate AHR is highly promiscuous, recognizing a diverse array of chemicals. In addition to
the well-known xenobiotics, AHR ligands include dietary phytochemicals, microbiome-derived microbial
metabolites, and endogenous metabolites such as tryptophan catabolites, all of which collectively contribute to
the internal chemical exposome. A comprehensive mechanistic understanding of AHR’s role in the response to
environmental exposures has been hindered by the complexity of its physiological functions and the
bewildering diversity of its ligands. Here, we propose a set of innovative molecular studies to elucidate the
sequence-structure-function determinants of AHR ligand-dependence and the origin of its ligand diversity.
Evidence suggests that the AHR evolved from a ligand-independent (constitutively active) ancestor. The
proposed basic research will experimentally determine the evolutionary trajectory and underlying genetic and
structural mechanisms that drove the evolution of AHR ligand-dependence and promiscuity. In Aim 1, we will
establish the ligand-specificity of AHRs from present-day species through a systematic experimental
assessment of phylogenetically diverse metazoan AHRs, including new invertebrate and early vertebrate
AHRs. In Aim 2, we will use ancestral sequence reconstruction (ASR) to “resurrect” ancestral AHR proteins
and then determine their ligand-binding sensitivity and specificity, revealing the identities of ancestral and
derived ligands. In Aim 3, we will use phylogenetic and protein structural analysis to identify candidate
historical amino acid changes that caused the acquisition of ligand-binding and evolution of promiscuity. We
will test these hypotheses by engineering ancestral and extant proteins containing these substitutions and
experimentally assessing their function. Understanding the ancestral properties of the primordial ligand-
activated AHR and the mechanisms that drove the evolution of promiscuity will provide essential new insights
into the natural physiological ligands and biological functions of extant AHR, reveal the genetic and structural
mechanisms underlying AHR ligand recognition, and elucidate how and why AHR function is disrupted by
anthropogenic environmental contaminants.

of research projects using novel in situ sampling technologies and modeling approaches building on prior
research to address how changing climate could influence harmful algal bloom (HAB) dynamics and human
exposure to HAB toxins, a serious and global human health threat. The overall objective is to protect public
health through enhanced understanding of how climate and oceanic processes affect the intensity and
distribution of toxin-producing HABs and to understand the potential health risks from exposure even to low
levels of their potent neurotoxins, especially during susceptible stages of life. The Center will focus on two key
HAB taxa: Alexandrium catenella, which produces the saxitoxins responsible for paralytic shellfish poisoning
(PSP), and Pseudo-nitzschia spp., which produce domoic acid responsible for amnesic shellfish poisoning
(ASP) syndrome, both are expanding geographically. Novel, targeted, efficient, and data-rich sampling
approaches developed by the applicants and applied in situ in natural settings have revealed new controls of
A. catenella population dynamics, and have identified possible new climate links regarding toxic Pseudo-
nitzschia species. Project 1 will examine further the physiological and climatic variables affecting these HABs,
which may underlie population adaptation in different habitats and different environmental regimes. Project 2
will incorporate these new and fundamental insights on bloom regulation into coupled climate-population
models to predict HAB threats under future climate scenarios, a key step toward being able to quantify future
risks from this recurrent public health threat. In biomedical studies with the zebrafish model, Project 3 has
identified myelination in the developing brain as a target of domoic acid. They will use transgenic zebrafish and
single-cell RNA-sequencing to identify the cell-specific mechanisms underlying effects of domoic acid,
saxitoxin, and the cyanotoxin anatoxin-a in zebrafish embryos in vivo and will use human iPSC-derived 3D
brain systems in vitro to elucidate toxin effects on neural and glial cell differentiation in human cells. Studies
also will determine whether prior exposure to ubiquitous persistent organic pollutants may modify effects of
subsequent exposure to saxitoxin and domoic acid. All projects will collaborate in modeling to link oceanic
processes to human exposure, helping to define the exposure of susceptible human subpopulations and
predict the effects of a changing climate. The Community Engagement Core will facilitate integration of the
research with education and engagement of resource managers and other stakeholders. We also will improve
awareness of emerging HAB issues for the public health community and develop new educational materials
and interactive activities for K-12 classrooms, and for health care providers. An Administrative Core will
encourage open discussion of planning, integration, communication and enhancing diverse perspectives, and
provide rigorous evaluation of progress in all aspects of the program.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：The corticospinal tract (CST) is a critical circuit underlying skilled voluntary movements. Damage to this circuit
during development can cause permanent, long-term movement disability in humans. Recognizing and treating
such developmental CST damage is challenging, largely because immediately after the lesion, there are limited
or almost no functional deficits. However, early recognition and intervention with the appropriate treatment
measures is key to reducing long-term disability. The use of preclinical mouse models, which have otherwise
proven to be highly useful in functional investigations of nervous system development, has been limited in this
regard. Since the CST is known to control skilled movements, established behavioral tests in mice that
investigate CST function require training mice in skilled tasks. This precludes their application in neonatal mice.
Further, mouse models used to investigate developmental CST damage, e.g. neonatal hypoxia or spinal injuries,
do not only damage the CST; rather they disrupt multiple neural pathways. It therefore remains completely
unknown whether the CST contributes only to skilled movements in adult mice, or whether it also contributes to
the development of natural, innate motor ability during development, beginning in neonatal mice. This latter
possibility would suggest that there are early, albeit subtle, behavioral correlates of developmental CST injury in
mice. We recently developed a new microsurgical approach to specifically disrupt the developing CST in
neonatal mice. In addition, we have also established the use of Motion Sequencing (MoSeq), a new machine
learning and artificial intelligence platform, to longitudinally investigate the development of natural movements
in neonatal mice. Our preliminary results using MoSeq suggest that developmental damage to the CST results
in specific changes to movement structures in mice, as early as P12; these extend into maturity at P35. Further,
analysis of these P35 mice using conventional metrics of locomotion such as the Catwalk, did not identify any
deficits, highlighting the sensitivity of MoSeq in identifying changes in mouse movements. This proposal
investigates the hypothesis that the CST controls development of natural mouse movements, and not only skilled
movements at maturity. We will use MoSeq to analyze Fezf2 knock out (Fezf2 KO) mice in which the CST is
never established during development (Aim1), as well as mice that undergo microsurgical lesions to disrupt
spinal connectivity of the CST at distinct developmental times (Aim2). Together, our work will identify novel
functional readouts of developmental damage to the CST using natural mouse movements. This new unbiased
quantitative approach toward investigating the earliest behavioral signs of corticospinal dysfunction in mice which
will have eventual application in investigations of descending circuits of motor control, as well as multiple
preclinical models of developmental damage such as neonatal hypoxia or spinal injuries.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Subcerebral projection neurons (SCPN) reside in the neocortex, and extend axons to subcerebral targets in the
brainstem and spinal cord. Corticospinal neurons (CSN), a subclass of SCPN, project to the spinal cord and their
axons form the corticospinal tract (CST), a critical circuit for voluntary motor control. In addition, projections from
the neocortex to brainstem targets function in parallel with CSN to exert motor control. Degeneration of these
projection neurons in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), along with degeneration of spinal motor neurons,
causes spasticity and paralysis. In humans, damage to the CST after spinal cord injury is a principal cause of
loss of voluntary motor control. Further, integrity of corticospinal connectivity is centrally linked to recovery from
stroke and cerebral palsy. There have been multiple investigations detailing the role of cortico-brainstem vs.
corticospinal projections in both motor control, as well as their distinct contributions to functional recovery in
these distinct causes of paralysis. However, it remains unclear when and how these distinct projections are
established during development. Understanding the molecular basis of this specification and differentiation
during development therefore holds significant promise in establishing approaches that are tailored to enhancing
plasticity of these related, yet distinct circuits. A necessary first step toward this ultimate goal is to identify the
molecular mechanisms directing SCPN axons to brainstem (cortico-brainstem neurons) versus spinal cord
(CSN). Ongoing work in our lab has identified that such projections are initially specified during the process of
axon extension during development. We have identified that cortico-brainstem and corticospinal neurons express
distinct genes and can be molecularly distinguished in mice by birth. Further our data suggest that the
transcriptional regulator Satb2 acts, in part, to specify cortico-brainstem neurons. This proposal investigates the
hypothesis that transcriptional regulation controls the development of cortico-brainstem vs. corticospinal
projections by late embryonic development in mice. Building on this foundation, we will first identify the time point
in development when these projections are specified using knock-in Cre reporter mice (Aim 1). This will be tested
using intracerebral injections of AAV-reporters at distinct developmental times in utero with adult analysis of
axonal projections. In Aim 2, we will investigate the transcriptional targets of Satb2 in SCPN at later
developmental times by profiling all SCPN in Satb2 WT and conditional KO mice, as well as by Satb2
overexpression, at single cell resolution. Finally, in Aim 3 using subpopulation-specific transgenic Cre lines, we
will investigate SCPN axon targeting in both Satb2 loss- and gain-of-function. In addition, we will investigate
whether misexpression of Satb2 target genes can alter SCPN targeting to the brainstem vs. spinal targets.
Together, our work will discern in-depth, the mechanisms of when and how transcriptional regulation controls
SCPN segmental “identity” thereby providing a mechanistic framework for subsequent identification of molecules
controlling segmentally appropriate SCPN connectivity with subcerebral targets.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Abstract (Summary): In patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and the related motor
neuron disease (MND) primary lateral sclerosis (PLS), deficits in motor control occur as a consequence
of the degeneration of corticospinal neurons (CSNs). ALS is more common than PLS, and genetically
more complex, with familial forms associated with causal mutations in over 30 ALS-related genes. In
these ALS mice, however, dysfunction and degeneration of CSNs have not been carefully examined,
and data implicating corticospinal (CS) circuits in these model systems of ALS is surprisingly limited.
One reason for this may be the very different pattern of connectivity between CSNs and spinal MNs in
humans vs. mice. In humans, CS axons located in the ventral and lateral funiculi form direct
connections with both MNs (cortico-motoneuronal (CM) connections) and interneurons. In contrast,
CS axons in mice are located mainly in the dorsal funiculus and only form indirect connections with
MNs through pre-motor interneurons. Therefore, we will use PlexinA1 mutant mice which have CM
connections together with ALS mouse models to analyze CS circuits. Our central hypothesis is that
progressive defects in CS circuitry in ALS mice will be exacerbated by the establishment of CM
connections. In Aim 1, we will determine formation of CS circuits in ALS mouse models with CM
connections. In Aim 2, we will determine function of CS circuits in ALS mouse models with CM
connections. In Aim 3, we will examine skilled movements in ALS mouse models with CM connections.
These studies will provide a model system to study mechanisms of CS degeneration in ALS/PLS, and
to test novel therapeutics targeting upper motor neuron dysfunction in these disorders.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：The highly orchestrated muscle activation sequences during motor behaviors are achieved directly through the
fine-tuned firing of motor neurons in the ventral spinal cord. These motor neurons are mainly regulated by spinal
interneurons present in all mammals, which are, in turn, connected to other spinal neurons as well as various
types of descending neurons from the brain, such as corticospinal (CS), reticulospinal and rubrospinal neurons.
Until recently, the identities and functioning of the interneuron subtypes and descending neurons participating in
individual circuits had remained elusive. What remains lacking is knowledge of the arrangement and functional
role of the spinal interneuron subtypes in individual circuits. There is, therefore, a critical need to determine the
anatomical and functional connectivity of these spinal interneuron subtypes and how they regulate motor
behaviors. Our overall objectives in this application are to (i) map anatomical and functional connectivity of
different classes of spinal interneurons (Aims 1 & 2), and (ii) elucidate how those interneurons effect motor
behaviors (Aim 3). Our central hypothesis is that each interneuron subtype will exhibit preferential connections
with distinct descending neurons to control discrete forms of locomotor and skilled movements.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Corticospinal neurons (CSN) reside in the neocortex, and extend axons to specific segmental targets in the
spinal cord forming the corticospinal tract (CST). CSN critically control voluntary movement and are centrally
involved in recovery from paralysis originating from multiple causes, e.g., stroke, spinal cord injury (SCI), cerebral
palsy, etc.. CSN degeneration in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), along with degeneration of spinal motor
neurons, causes spasticity and paralysis. Recovery in all these distinct causes of paralysis would ultimately
require long-distance CST regeneration, which remains an unattained goal in regenerative neuroscience.
Previous work using neonatal lesions has established CST regenerative ability declines from development into
adulthood. When the CST is damaged in early life, there is greater plasticity and regeneration as compared to
similar lesions in the adult. However, despite this work, we still do not know when long-distance regenerative
ability is lost during development. This is because a key limitation of these established neonatal lesion models
is that they massively disrupt the spinal environment and thereby interfere with the normal process of long-
distance CSN axon extension during development. This limits the ability of these lesion paradigms to assess the
ability of the CNS to support long-distance regeneration. We recently established a novel microsurgical approach
to axotomize the CST during development, while leaving the spinal environment relatively intact. We identified
that long-distance CST regenerative ability is lost at different times at distinct spinal levels– at postnatal day 4
(P4) the CST can fully regenerate when lesioned at thoracic T11, but fails to do so when lesioned at cervical C2.
Our results indicate that the loss of long-distance CST regenerative ability closely parallels the developmental
timeline of normal CST growth into the spinal cord, which suggests that the normal process of differentiation,
both in CSN and in the spinal cord, results in the loss of long-distance regenerative ability. This proposal
investigates the hypothesis that inhibition of differentiation to prolong the immature developmental state will
extend the time window when long-distance regeneration is possible. Specifically, we will manipulate the function
of RE1 silencing transcription factor (REST), a global repressor of neural differentiation, to test this hypothesis.
Building on this foundation, we will first manipulate REST function (both gain- and loss-of function) at distinct
spinal levels to investigate whether this affects the ability of these spinal segments to support long-distance CST
regeneration (Aim1). We will manipulate REST function in CSN to similarly investigate long-distance CST
regeneration (Aim 2). Finally, we will use single cell profiling to investigate potentially distinct molecular effects
of microlesions at distinct spinal levels on distinct CSN subsets depending on their developmental state (Aim 3).
Together, our work will discern novel molecular mechanisms of how long-distance CST regeneration is regulated
during development, thereby providing a mechanistic framework for subsequent identification of molecules that

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Experimental data linking thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency to Alzheimer’s disease (AD) inspired our
clinical trial, which generated preliminary evidence that pharmacological thiamine produced by the drug
benfotiamine provides clinical benefit. We hypothesize that pharmacological thiamine is protective by diminishing
the formation of advanced glycation endproducts (AGE). AGE are proteins and lipids that become glycated and
harmful following exposure to reducing sugars. AGE cause irreversible damage to biological macromolecules by
altering their structural and functional integrity. Abundant evidence links AGE to AD. In AD animal models,
thiamine deficiency increases AGE and exacerbates plaques and tangle formation, while increased thiamine
diminishes AGE and pathology. In our pilot clinical trial, pharmacological thiamine levels diminished global
plasma AGE levels and improved symptoms in patients with AD. Interestingly, in AD patients, the effects of high
thiamine are diminished in patients carrying the APOE4 genotype, the most significant genetic risk factor for
sporadic AD. We postulate that this is because APOE4 increases unique AGE at earlier stages.
 Optimizing this therapeutic approach requires a better understanding of the mechanism underlying the
action of benfotiamine. All previous related AD and thiamine studies have utilized AGE antibody surveys. This
data is limited to a small range of AGE and provides no data on the proteins and specific sites modified with
glycation. We will provide this critical data by using multiple state-of-the-art mass spectrometric measures of
AGE. Global glycaproteomics will identify glycated proteins and specific sites of AGE modifications and AGE-
omics will identify a broad range of crosslinking and non-crosslinking AGE. A second major gap is the lack of
our understanding on how APOE4 modifies the response to thiamine. Novel APOE3 and APOE4 humanized
APP mouse models will allow us to test these interactions. We will test our hypotheses: (1) In AD autopsy
brains at different stages of the disease, AGE modifications are critical to the pathophysiology of AD in
an APOE-dependent manner. (2) In mouse models of AD, thiamine deficiency drives AD-like pathology
and memory loss by causing specific brain and blood AGE modifications which are modified by APOE
genotype. (3) In mouse models, benfotiamine is beneficial by diminishing specific AGE and the treatment
must be initiated at an earlier stage of disease in APOE4 mice.
 These studies will dramatically improve our understanding of the role of AGE in AD and its link to a treatment
of pharmacological thiamine levels. Defining the interaction of AGE and thiamine in the etiology and progression
of AD will enable the development of specific AGE signatures for targets of engagement for therapeutic trials
and as AD diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers. These studies will define the differential effectiveness of
thiamine by APOE genotype and define the most effective therapeutic approach for APOE3 and consistently
hard to treat APOE4 carriers. We therefore expect this study will have a high impact on translational AD medicine.

The ability to regulate when and how emotions are used to guide cognition relies on adaptive and plastic circuits
that can integrate internal limbic-visceral and external sensory-motor information for a given behavioral context.
The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is an area that plays an important role in this process of emotional regulation
and multimodal integration, acting as a unique connectional node for the otherwise segregated cognitive, motor
and limbic networks. The ACC forms a robust network with the amygdala (AMY), a key limbic structure for
emotion and arousal, which exhibits specialized circuit reorganization and plasticity during emotional stress. Our
previously funded R01 (MH116008) focused on comparing the ACC with the lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC),
another region implicated in cognition and stress, and on the extrinsic ACC pathways to cognitive/motor and
limbic areas. It remains unclear how exactly these multimodal pathways interact across the functionally distinct
rostral ‘cognitive’ (a32), ventral ‘limbic’ (a25) and dorsal ‘motor’ (a24) subdivisions of the ACC, which is the focus
of this renewal application. Our work in the previous grant period has shown that the robust ACC interconnections
with AMY span all ACC areas and are therefore, well-suited for integrating information across these distinct ACC
functional domains. Further, compared to ACC projections to cognitive/motor areas in LPFC and dorsal premotor
(PMd) cortices, AMY-targeting ACC pyramidal neurons show greater laminar diversity in their distribution, and
biophysical, structural, and inhibitory synaptic properties. Computational modeling show that these unique single-
cell biophysical and connectional properties contribute to diverse laminar oscillatory dynamics in ACC outputs to
AMY, which can support synchrony at low frequencies in L5, but at high frequencies in L3. In contrast, cortico-
cortical ACC outputs to PMd are more tuned towards higher oscillatory frequencies in both layers. While we have
shown how these extrinsic ACC outputs are diverse at the single cell level, the question remains as to how
multimodal information is integrated within the ACC. This renewal focuses on the largely uncharacterized short-
range interconnections within and between the functionally distinct ACC areas that are likely important for this
multimodal integration. Using anatomical tract-tracing, optogenetics, slice physiology, high-resolution
microscopy and computational modeling we propose to assess intrinsic ACC-ACC interconnections in adult
rhesus monkeys (5-13Y) with regards to their: excitatory vs inhibitory constituents, neuromodulation of synaptic
plasticity, interactions with long-range cognitive (LPFC), motor (PMd) and limbic (AMY) pathways, and
contributions to diverse network dynamics. The overall hypothesis is that distinct short-range intrinsic ACC
circuits have specialized excitatory, inhibitory and neuromodulatory properties and interactions with
long-range cortico-limbic pathways, which endow diverse network oscillatory dynamics and plasticity
in the ACC. Novel data from this study will yield new insights into how selective circuit neuromodulation within
distinct ACC networks can lead to normal cognitive-affective behavior and its dysfunction in the primate.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Amyloid diseases afflict 10 million patients worldwide. This project is focused on AA amyloidosis, a life-threatening complication of chronic inflammation wherein deposition of serum amyloid A (SAA), and its fragments causes kidney and liver damage and, if untreated, death. There is no cure for AA and the treatment options are very limited. To help design amyloid-specific therapies, we will determine how lipids and GAGs, the major ligands of SAA, influence its misfolding. Our prior research revealed that SAA clears diverse lipids from the sites of injury by sequestering them into nanoparticles that facilitate sPLA2 lipolysis; we established the structural basis for this SAA action. Our goal now is to determine how this lipid-scavenging function is linked to pathologic amyloid deposition. Our hypothesis rooted in extensive pilot studies is that lipoprotein formation by SAA is antagonistic to amyloid formation while GAG binding is agonistic. Our powerful approach integrates an array of biochemical, biophysical and computational methods to test this and other new ideas in 3 complementary Specific Aims. Aim 1 will determine how biochemical composition of SAA-lipid complexes influences amyloid formation. Murine or human recombinant SAA will be reconstituted with diverse lipids in complexes that will be selectively hydrolyzed, and amyloid formation will be explored by spectroscopic, electron microscopic, immunochemical and other tools. The results will help identify key steps in SAA-lipid homeostasis that critically influence amyloid formation, and will test a fascinating idea: lipid-modifying strategies may help treat AA amyloidosis. Aim 2 will dissect the amyloidogenic pathways of lipid-bound and free SAA and how GAGs affect these pathways. We will explore the interplay between SAA binding to lipids and GAGs, lipolysis, and formation of amyloid oligomers and fibrils. The results will help target SAA-GAG interactions in AA and other amyloid diseases. Aim 3 will utilize our new versatile ELISA-based assay that uses micrograms of protein to quantify the binding to amyloid modulators during fibrillogenesis. SAA binding to various GAG mimetics and small-molecule drugs will be used as a model; key results will be validated by other methods. Our pilot studies explain the failure of prior clinical trials for AA and suggest that larger molecules can block the SAA-GAG binding. Moreover, we will use our new assay to determine how other amyloid proteins (A, -synuclein, tau, TTR, etc.) interact with diverse amyloid modulators (GAGs, apoE, etc.) Impact: this project will advance AA research and therapeutic targeting to a new level. Moreover, it will develop new tools and concepts that can be extrapolated to other systemic and neurodegenerative amyloid diseases, such as Alzheimer’s and other major diseases.

The Summer Program in Neuroscience (SPIN) at Boston University School of Medicine is a unique, annual 8-
week program in which 10–15 undergraduate students perform mentored neuroscience research, receive
instruction in graduate-/medical-level neuroscience, and observe clinical activities focused on the diagnosis and
treatment of brain disorders. In the classroom, students meet with decorated medical school teaching faculty
and learn basic and clinical neuroscience through small-group interactive sessions, analysis of clinical and
research problems and cases, analysis of brain structure using microscopic brain sections and magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) brain scans, as well as hands-on exploration and dissection of human brains. For the
research portion of the program, students are paired with a faculty member from a basic science or clinical
department and conduct a mentored research project, the results of which are presented at a public conference
that closes the session. In the clinic, students rotate on neurology and neurosurgery inpatient and outpatient
services, attend brain cuttings sessions in the hospital morgue, and review radiographic studies with working
neuroradiologists. These three aspects of the program intersect to generate a nuanced education in the structure
and function of the brain in health and disease from both research and clinical perspectives. To help participants
integrate SPIN experiences with their future, sessions are held that focus on scientific skills and career
development, including sessions on applying to graduate and medical schools, developing oral presentation
skills, and interview skills. End-of-program interviews with prior participants indicate students felt that SPIN was
a life-changing experience that encouraged and helped them pursue further graduate and medical education.
Although we have made every attempt to recruit students from traditionally underrepresented minority
backgrounds, the tuition-based model of our program has been a significant barrier. As a result, SPIN participants
have lacked the diversity that characterize the ideal clinical and research teams. Funding from this proposal
would subsidize the cost of participating in the program (tuition and housing) and provide stipend support for six
scholarships. We will target recruitment to outstanding underrepresented minority students in institutions and
biomedical conferences historically attended by these students, and restructure our application and our
admittance for tuition-based students to place an emphasis on accepting students who have demonstrated
commitment to diversity. We also propose to change the program to target specific scientific skills and expand
programming of career development. Finally, we will implement a thorough real-time tracking and evaluation
plan to follow our students and measure the impact of the program on their career choices through the
establishment of digitally-based interactions and communities. The goal of this proposal is to provide talented
students from underrepresented populations with access to formative experiences and training that will guide
them toward successful biomedical careers and thus diversify the biomedical workforce.

There is growing evidence demonstrating that extreme heat is adversely impacting the mental health of
exposed populations. However, there is a need for further research at high spatial and temporal scales that
allows for investigation of the role of potential neighborhood-level mediators (e.g., residential greenness or air
pollution) and the impacts in potentially vulnerable subgroups. In this mixed-methods study we will investigate
the impact of extreme heat on mental health among uninsured and publicly insured individuals in the City of
Boston, with a particular focus on understanding how both environmental factors and individual behavioral
patterns influence the effects of heat on mental health within this high-risk population. We will first leverage
data (2005 – 2019) from a unique emergency services program (Boston Emergency Services Team [BEST])
that services ~18,000 publicly insured and uninsured persons each year in the greater Boston area. In Aim 1,
we will assess the relationship between temperature and psychiatric emergency services encounters in the
BEST data, with particular focus to diurnal variation in exposure-response that can be leveraged to provide
additional care for these high-risk patients. In Aim 2, we will supplement this quantitative data with the
collection of semi-structured qualitative interviews with clinicians who are treating BEST patients during warm
periods (May 2024 – September 2024). The objective of these interviews is to assess BEST clinician
perspectives on the role that extreme heat plays in mental illness, as well as the feasibility of proposed
interventions within the BEST population. We will also identify key resources needed by clinicians to support
patients who may not have access to traditional protective measures (such as in-home air conditioning) in
managing their mental health during periods of extreme heat. This focus on clinical perspectives is a critical
innovation of this project, as work on climate change and health is often purely epidemiological in nature and
thus misses opportunities for effective intervention to support the health of climate-affected populations.
Finally, in Aim 3, we will quantify the potential for heterogeneity in the temperature-mental health relationship
using the BEST data. We will focus specifically on important individual indicators of vulnerability (including age,
sex, race/ethnicity, and experiencing homelessness), as well as neighborhood-level features such as air
pollution, the built environment / urban greenspace, and the presence of existing interventions (e.g., cooling
centers) intending to reduce the health impacts of extreme heat in the greater Boston area. The findings from
Aim 3 will complement the qualitative data produced in Aim 2 to provide a fuller understanding of the factors
that contribute to mental health impacts of extreme heat, ranging from social and behavioral to environmental
determinants. Overall, this study will provide crucial information to support this high-risk population in the
context of extreme heat and global climate change.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
Millions of Americans are exposed daily to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) due to the current and
historical use of these chemicals in consumer and industrial products. PFAS exposure in humans is associated
with liver disease and serum hyperlipidemia (increased serum cholesterol, in particular). However, understanding
the mechanism(s) linking PFAS exposure to dyslipidemia is hindered by 1) the ability of PFAS to activate
peroxisome proliferator activated receptor α (PPARα), a receptor activated by fibrate drugs that reduces serum
triacylglycerides, 2) apparently disparate effects of PFAS on serum lipids in human and rodents (in which PFAS
can decrease serum lipids), 3) lack of understanding if/how PFAS congeners exert distinct effects on lipid
homeostasis, and 4) species differences in nuclear receptors that regulate PFAS-induced effects. Our
overarching objective is to determine the mechanisms by which PFAS disrupt systemic lipid homeostasis. Our
research focuses on nuclear receptors that are activated by PFAS and are directly involved in lipid regulation:
PPARα, constitutive androstane receptor (CAR), and pregnane X receptor (PXR). PPARα activation decreases
hepatic and serum lipids while CAR and PXR activation can have the opposite effect. There are two major
chemical classes of PFAS: perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCA) and perfluoroalkyl sulfonic acids (PFSA). We
used a human-relevant model in vitro to show that PFCA and PFSA activate human PPARα (huPPARα) with
differing efficacies. Using mice expressing huPPARα and fed an American diet, we showed that: 1)
perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) activates hepatic huPPARα in vivo at body burdens found in humans, 2) CAR
and PXR also are strongly activated, 3) PFOA increases liver lipids and serum cholesterol, and 4) PFOA’s effects
are sex-dependent. Given the strength of the PFAS-induced CAR/PXR signal, the potential for CAR/PXR to
differentiate the effects of PFCAs and PFSAs, and that CAR/PXR also are activated in a species-specific manner,
we propose that the most human relevant in vivo model should be multi-humanized. Thus, our Specific Aims are
as follows. In Aim 1, we will refine our novel mouse model to investigate human relevant mechanisms of PFAS
action by incorporating human CAR (huCAR) and PXR (huPXR) into the huPPARα mouse and update our novel
“What we eat in America” diet. In Aim 2, we will test the contribution of huPPARα to PFAS-induced toxicological
effects in vivo in the context of huCAR and huPXR by comparing effects in huPPARα+:huCAR+:huPXR+ and
PPARαNull(mouse/human):huCAR+:huPXR+ mice exposed to human-relevant PFAS levels. We will test the hypotheses
that a) activation of PPARα by PFAS limits their capacity to stimulate hepatic steatosis and serum hyperlipidemia
by counteracting effects of CAR/PXR activation and b) PFAS structure will determine the balance of
huPPARα:huCAR/huPXR activation resulting in differences in toxicological effects. Results will fill critical gaps
by generating an in vivo, human-relevant model to investigate PFAS-induced, clinically-relevant disease and
providing novel insights into the mechanisms of action of PFAS in liver and intestine.

A major unmet goal in pulmonary medicine is to distinguish pneumonia sub-phenotypes responsive to host-
directed therapies. We observe that some humans who died with pneumonia have abundant fibrin in their
airspaces while others show little or none, correlating with neutrophils and necrosis. Similarly, some mouse
models of pneumonia result in lungs with abundant airspace fibrin, while others do not; airspace fibrin
associates with both neutrophils and necrosis in these models as well. While fibrin in the airspaces is a
recognized pathological feature of pneumonia, this heterogeneity is not. Because fibrin can be pro-
inflammatory and neutrophils can enhance fibrin accumulation, we propose the central hypothesis that fibrin
and neutrophils in the airspaces form a positive feedback loop that causes damage in a subset of pneumonias.
We will test this by pursuing three independent but mutually informative specific aims. In Aim 1, we will
determine whether fibrin in the airspaces drives neutrophilic pulmonary inflammation and adverse outcomes,
during high-fibrin pneumonia. Using genetic and pharmacologic approaches to interrupt key endogenous
drivers or inhibitors of fibrin accumulation (tissue factor, thrombin, or plasmin), we will test whether loss or gain
of fibrin decreases or increases, respectively, neutrophils and adverse outcomes like necrosis and lung injury
during the high-fibrin but not low-fibrin type of pneumonia in mice. In Aim 2, we will determine whether
neutrophils amplify fibrin accumulation in the airspaces, during high-fibrin pneumonia. We will use gene-
targeted mice to test whether CD11b and neutrophil elastase are each essential for airspace fibrin
accumulation during the high-fibrin but not low-fibrin sub-phenotype of pneumonia. We will also test whether
pharmacologically reducing fibrin or elastase activity when pneumonia is already underway can sever the
proposed positive feedback loop and improve outcomes during the high-fibrin pneumonia in mice. In Aim 3, we
will determine whether high-fibrin pneumonias involve distinctive lung transcriptomes that include a pro-fibrin
signature in airspace cells. We will profile lung transcriptomes of humans who died with high-fibrin vs. low-fibrin
pneumonia, to identify differentially expressed genes and pathways. In mouse models, we will compare lung
transcriptomes over the time-course of lethal high- and low-fibrin pneumonias, to reveal dynamics of changes
as well as consistencies or differences between the human subjects and mouse models. From mouse lungs,
airspace cells (alveolar macrophages, epithelial cells, and neutrophils) will be sorted from high- and low-fibrin
pneumonias to identify cell-specific transcriptome differences between these pneumonia sub-phenotypes. The
proposed studies will help elucidate the mechanisms and significance of high fibrin accumulation in the
airspaces of infected lungs. Results will be informative for whether and which subsets of pneumonia patients
may respond favorably to host-directed therapies targeting fibrin (like anticoagulants and fibrinolytics) and/or
neutrophils (like CD11b blockade or elastase inhibitors).

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
In high income countries, SUDI, and its sub-categories (1) Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) and (2)
Accidental Suffocation Deaths (ASD), are the leading preventable causes of infant mortality. The ensuing ‘back
to sleep’ campaigns have since proven among the most effective public health strategies ever identified for
reducing infant mortality. Yet, in low and middle-income countries (LMICs) almost nothing is known about the
burden of SUDI or its modifiable risk factors, and very few African countries have policies targeting SUDI. In our
recent systematic review, we documented a near absence of research on SUDI in Africa, excepting several well-
conducted investigations from South Africa. Our focus on SUDI emerged during a multi-year postmortem infant
surveillance project to establish the fatal burden of Respiratory Syncytial Virus. Over 3 years, we enrolled ~80%
of all infant deaths in Lusaka, Zambia, nearly 2,300 infants. Ultimately, SUDI was implicated in 7.4% of those
community deaths. Far from being rare, SUDI appeared to be a very common cause of infant demise, with
modifiable risk factors that were ubiquitous yet wholly unaddressed by existing policies in Zambia. If confirmed,
SUDI constitutes a major unmet opportunity to reduce infant mortality in Africa that has largely been ignored by
the global health community. Yet, our early data fall short of the gold standard for evaluating SUDI deaths.
Robust local prevalence data will be essential to support policy initiatives targeting SUDI and as a baseline from
which to judge the impact of such policies. Therefore, we are proposing Project Chisoni, a rigorous 5-year study
to precisely define the burden of SUDI and its modifiable risk factors in Zambia.
To achieve those broader goals, we have convened a multinational multidisciplinary team with expertise in
pediatrics, cause of death analysis, SUDI, pathology, molecular biology, and SUDI epidemiology. Our aims are:
SA1 will create a ‘gold standard’ evaluation of community infant deaths to demonstrate the burden of SUDI in
an African setting, which will include in-depth post-mortem evaluations, multiplex PCR to identify unanticipated
infectious causes of death and detailed death scene investigations to understand the context in which each death
occurred. This will generate the proportion of deaths that are due to SUDI and SUDI deaths/1000 live births.
SA2 includes three sub-aims. SA2.1 will be a matched case-control study examining the association of risk
factors with SUDI among the cases in SA1 vs. a group of contemporaneously enrolled healthy control infants;
SA2.2 takes the ORs and prevalence data from SA1 and S2.1 to calculate the population attributable fraction
(PAF) for risk factors alone or in combination, and therefore the theoretical number of lives that could be saved
through mitigation; and SA2.3 seeks to expand the generalizability of this project by conducting additional risk
factor prevalence surveys in different urban and rural settings in Zambia and several other African nations.

Parasitic infections by Trypanosoma brucei spp. undermine public health and economy in Sub-Saharan Africa.
From the basic science vantage point, discoveries of antigenic variation, trans-splicing, and RNA editing in these
early branching protozoans have contributed fundamental tenets of eukaryotic biology. Notably, work on
mitochondrial U-insertion/deletion mRNA editing introduced the guide RNA concept, a foundation of modern
genome altering technologies. Identification of terminal RNA uridylyltransferases (TUTases) in trypanosomes
has led to recognition of uridylation’s broad significance and diverse cellular roles, ranging from microRNA
turnover in flies to maternal mRNA clearance in mammals. Emerging structural insights establish mitochondrial
U-tailing in T. brucei as the paradigm of RNA processing and decay pathways present in most eukaryotes.
Conversely, the internal U-insertion is a central editing reaction unique to Kinetoplastea. This project will reveal
the mechanisms of TUTase-dependent RNA maturation and editing processes at atomic resolution.
Aim 1 investigates how the TUTase—exonuclease—RNA helicase nexus orchestrates mitochondrial RNA
metabolism. It focuses on protein complexes that couple U-tailing by KRET1 (T1) with degradation, and thereby
govern biogenesis, functionality, and metabolic fates of rRNAs, mRNAs and guide RNAs. Molecular, proteomics,
imaging and cryo-EM approaches will define T1 complexes’ functions, composition, interactomes and structures.
We have identified and will characterize an RNA helicase which links gRNA processing and editing.
Aim 2 examines the structural basis of U-insertion mRNA editing. We have discovered KRET2 (T2) and MEAT1
(M1) and their distinct complexes. By determining in vivo substrates and cryo-EM structures of these assemblies,
we will uncover the mechanisms of editing site selection and U-insertion by divergent T2 and M1 TUTases.

Older Black Americans have higher rates of cognitive impairment and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) than their
White counterparts, a disparity that is greater for Black women. Given the lack of effective therapies to slow
disease progression and symptoms, effective prevention is needed. Most knowledge of risk factors for
cognitive decline, the hallmark feature of AD, comes from studies of White populations and the contribution of
racially/socially-patterned risk factors among Black adults remains under-studied. We propose to study 2,500
Black women ages 55 and older from the Black Women’s Health Study (BWHS), a follow-up study of 59,000
Black women from across the US. Our goal is to identify social factors that, together with biomarkers of AD,
influence cognitive decline. The BWHS provides a unique opportunity to accomplish this goal. Over 27 years,
the BWHS has collected data through biennial questionnaires from participants on socioeconomic,
psychological, and physical stressors occurring at various times of life (e.g., low parental education, childhood
sexual/physical abuse, interpersonal racism), as well as information on many potential risk factors for AD and
cognitive decline (e.g., demographics, body size, behavioral factors (e.g., exercise, diet, smoking), medical
history, reproductive history, medication use, health care). The BWHS has collected and stored blood from a
large subsample of participants who agreed to wide sharing, such as GWAS results with other investigators
and public databases. After enrollment of 2,500 such participants with already-collected blood samples from
the BWHS, we propose to administer a validated telephone cognitive battery annually to measure cognition.
We will also measure a panel of AT(N) plasma biomarkers and conduct GWAS in order to examine the
associations of plasma biomarkers and genetic variants with cognitive decline. Based on the collected data
and the results from biomarker assessments, we will assess the joint effects of the stressors and biomarkers
on cognitive decline. A feasibility study demonstrated the willingness of BWHS participants to complete the
cognitive test battery over the telephone and indicated that enough BWHS participants will participate to reach
a study size of ~2,500 participants. The investigators have the experience and expertise to enroll participants;
measure cognition with a validated telephone cognitive battery; measure AT(N) biomarkers in stored plasma
and conduct GWAS; and with these data, to assess their separate and joint effects on cognitive decline. The
proposed study provides an unparalleled opportunity to leverage a large national sample of older Black women
on which comprehensive data on many factors that affect cognition have been collected to identify life-course
risk factors for cognitive decline. The findings will have important translational implications for efforts to prevent
cognitive decline in all populations, but especially in Black women who are disproportionately burdened.

The goal of this Program Project Grant (PPG) is advancing the latest discoveries in stem cell biology, human
organoid models, and gene editing to understand and treat genetic lung diseases. After a century of basic
sciences advances, culminating in recent Nobel Prize-winning discoveries, such as nuclear reprogramming
and gene editing, biomedical research now faces an inflection point, poised for clinical translation of basic
science successes. While it is hard to envision a more optimistic time in health-related research, treatments for
many devastating lung diseases have not yet been realized, and clinical therapies in most cases still largely
focus on treating symptoms or maintaining life support to allow endogenous lung tissue stem cells enough time
to repair, without available therapies able to interrupt disease-initiating mechanisms or augment the lung’s
capacity to regenerate. Here we address these challenges by proposing an integrated, multi-investigator PPG
to translate lung stem cell research from basic discovery to future clinical applications. An initial focus on
ameliorating genetic lung diseases of the airway and alveoli is pursued, given that their proximal
disease-driving gene mutations are well described. The use induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) carrying
these mutations or their gene-edited progeny is a shared technology harnessed by all Projects together with a
proposed Gene Editing Core, and coordinated by an Administrative Core. Our 4 project leaders have worked
together extensively to develop protocols to differentiate iPSCs into a broad diversity of lung epithelial lineages,
recently optimizing methods to produce the two stem cell populations that maintain all airway and alveolar
epithelia, basal cells and alveolar type 2 cells (AT2s), respectively. Having established these stem cell banks
and protocols, we turn our focus here on applying these resources to advance our mechanistic understanding
of how gene mutations initiate airway and alveolar epithelial dysfunction resulting in disease, and we seek to
therapeutically intervene with novel precision therapeutics or regenerative cell therapies. Towards these
goals, we here propose 4 projects and 2 cores, all interacting to complete shared aims, and synergistic
cross-project experiments. Aim 1 will promote collaborative, integrated cross-project approaches that
produce new human models of genetic airway and alveolar diseases, and will apply these in vitro iPSC and
organoid-based models to understand basic pathogenic mechanisms that lead from epithelial dysfunction to
lung disease. Aim 2 will identify potential therapeutic strategies able to reverse or ameliorate aberrant
pathways responsible for the alveolar dysfunction present in genetic diseases that affect the distal lung,
including proteostasis, mitochondrial dysfunction, and metabolic changes that we hypothesize lead to
reversible epithelial toxic gain-of-function phenotypes. Aim 3 will develop a future approach for treating genetic
lung diseases based on the in vivo reconstitution of airway and alveolar stem cell compartments via
intra-airway transplantation of pluripotent stem cell-derived airway basal or distal alveolar epithelial cells.

Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a debilitating condition with deleterious effects on individuals and
society. Evidence-based treatments for PTSD are available, including cognitive processing therapy (CPT) and
prolonged exposure (PE), but response rates are suboptimal, and dropout rates are high. Patients report
concerns about treatment that prevent optimal response, but evidence suggests therapists are often unaware of
patients' concerns and do not intervene effectively to help their patients benefit from treatment. The purpose of
this research is to refine and test an Adjunctive Writing intervention for Amplifying Response and Engagement
(AWARE), which was developed to enhance outcomes in CPT and PE. AWARE integrates findings from the field
of health communication and uses a writing task and guided therapist responses to facilitate improved patient-
therapist communication about patients’ treatment-related concerns during existing check-ins in CPT and PE.
After iteratively refining AWARE through a case series (n=4), a pilot randomized controlled trial (n=50) will be
conducted to preliminarily compare CPT/PE with AWARE to CPT/PE treatment as usual (TAU). The primary aim
of the RCT is to take an experimental therapeutics approach to demonstrate that AWARE is feasible, acceptable,
and engages the target of improved patient-therapist communication relative to TAU. A preliminary examination
will also be conducted of the effects of 1) AWARE vs. TAU, and 2) variability in patient-therapist communication
on symptom improvement and treatment completion. An exploratory aim is to examine patient-therapist
communication as a mechanism of improved symptom reduction and attendance in AWARE using session-by-
session assessments to see if the putative mechanism precedes and predicts the outcomes. This trial is
consistent with NIMH's Strategy 3.1.A, "Developing novel interventions using a mechanism-informed,
experimental therapeutics approach," and can both enhance outcomes for patients with PTSD and improve the
field's knowledge of processes for enhancing PTSD treatments. Further, given that AWARE is a brief intervention
that can be implemented during existing check-ins in evidence-based treatments, AWARE can be easily scaled
and implemented to enhance outcomes across mental health disorders. The proposed research and training
plans will allow the applicant to gain essential knowledge and applied experience in 1) refining and evaluating a
mechanism-based intervention to enhance PTSD treatments, 2) translating health communication knowledge to
improve PTSD treatment outcomes, 3) using advanced data analyses to examine mechanisms of therapeutic
change, 4) conducting clinical trials in an experimental therapeutics framework, and 5) professional development
and grantsmanship. It will facilitate the applicant's transition to an independent investigator who uses treatment
mechanistic knowledge to optimize PTSD treatment outcomes. This project will take place at the National Center
for PTSD at VA Boston Healthcare System with support from accomplished mentors committed to the applicant's
professional development: Drs. Tara Galovski (primary mentor), Shannon Kehle-Forbes, and Brian Smith.

This K08 Mentored Clinical Scientist Development Award will provide Dr. Kelsey Serier with training to develop
an independent research career devoted to understanding the effect of trauma and trauma-related negative
mental health sequalae, namely posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), on the development and course of type
2 diabetes (T2D). Dr. Serier has assembled an impressive interdisciplinary mentorship team comprised of
experts in trauma, behavioral science, epidemiology, endocrinology, and health informatics to support her
development and successful completion of the proposed training and research goals. Through a
comprehensive and carefully designed training plan, Dr. Serier will address previous training gaps and develop
skills in (1) domain-specific knowledge related to PTSD and T2D, (2) epidemiologic methods and longitudinal
data analysis, and (3) professional development and grant writing. A cross-cutting training goal is furthering her
skills in conducting interdisciplinary team science. The proposed research program leverages the largest
electronic health record cohort of individuals at risk of T2D (n = 6,082,018) in the United States. Data come
from the Veteran’s Health Administration and includes an extensive set of clinician-based diagnoses,
laboratory tests, and up to 15 years of follow-up data. Utilizing this cohort, the current study aims to address
several critical gaps in our current knowledge of PTSD and T2D, specifically: (1) a lack of prospective data that
include clinician-derived diagnostic information, (2) minimal consideration of psychiatric comorbidity, (3) limited
investigation of PTSD on outcomes in individuals with T2D, including glycemic control, and (4) an absence of
studies considering the impact of sex, race, and ethnicity. Aim One will estimate the effect of PTSD,
depression, and their comorbidity on the rate of T2D using cox proportional hazard models and interaction
contrasts. Aim Two will include individuals who developed T2D during the study period (n = 936,596). A series
of conditional logistic regression models and interaction contrasts will be used to estimate the odds of poor
glycemic control in PTSD, depression, and their comorbidity relative to non-psychiatric comparison groups.
Aim Three will examine the extent to which sex, race, and ethnicity modify the associations in Aims One and
Two. The current study includes a large number of women (n = 504,002) and individuals identifying as non-
Hispanic Black (n = 888,465), and Hispanic and Latino (n = 331, 817) to allow for analyses examining the
differential effect of PTSD on T2D in subpopulations with a higher burden of disease. The unique data source
and methodological rigor of the proposed study offers an efficient way to examine the associations between
PTSD and a range of T2D-related outcomes, which will ultimately inform targeted T2D prevention and
intervention approaches. Furthermore, the project will provide the applicant with essential interdisciplinary
training for an independent and integrative research program examining associations between the
psychological sequalae of trauma and T2D.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：SIGNIFICANCE: G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the largest class of membrane proteins in the human
genome and are implicated in a wide array of cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. Notably, GPCRs are the
targets of one third of FDA approved therapeutics, including drugs prescribed for coronary heart disease,
hypertension, and asthma. However, of the ~800 known GPCRs, ~120 are orphan receptors (oGPCRs), which
are considered druggable targets but remain understudied in basic research efforts as they lack a known ligand.
Over the past two decades, extensive efforts to deorphanize oGPCRs have resulted in little turnout. It is evident
there is a need to increase the rate of discovery of ligands for oGPCRs. This proposal outlines a yeast directed
evolution platform for systematic, high-throughput discovery of antibody-based ligands for oGPCRs.
Deorphanizing a single oGPCR alone would open the door to understanding new biology and development of a
potential therapeutic agent.
BACKGROUND: oGPCR deorphanization efforts have been historically slow and low-throughput. Conventional
screens for oGPCR ligands can handle many targets, but due to the sheer amount of possibilities, including
protons, photons, lipids, hormones, peptides, and larger proteins, success has been limited. Nanobodies, or
small antibody fragments, offer distinct advantages for ligand screening, namely their suitability to directed
evolution. Directed evolution allows for billions of nanobodies to be screened for binding and modulation of
oGPCRs with a simple growth selection. Using a yeast-based hypermutation directed evolution platform, and a
precise, scalable, high-throughput continuous culture device, directed evolution campaigns can be scaled up to
ensure a deep search of nanobody sequence space.
SYNOPSIS OF AIMS: In this proposal are two related, but not interdependent aims. AIM1 establishes a
systematic workflow for the functional reconstitution of human GPCRs in yeast, which will (1) create a library of
yeast strains with orphan and non-orphan GPCRs, and (2) elucidate general guidelines to increase success
rates of GPCR expression in yeast. AIM2 takes oGPCRs found to be functional in yeast and uses them to run
directed evolution campaigns to discover nanobody ligands and validate these ligands in human cells. Both aims
can be developed in parallel, with results from AIM1 being progressively integrated into AIM2. Together, these
innovative platforms will lead to the deorphanization of many oGPCRs, thereby enabling the exploration of new
GPCR biology and pharmacology.

The maintenance of cellular and tissue homeostasis relies on the tight regulation of cell growth and proliferation.
This regulation is predominantly controlled by two evolutionarily conserved pathways: the mammalian Target of
Rapamycin (mTOR) pathway and the Hippo pathway. Dysregulation of both the mTOR and Hippo pathways
promotes aberrant cell proliferation, tissue overgrowth and tumor development. Elucidating how the mTOR and
Hippo signaling pathways coordinate their activities is therefore a vitally important, yet poorly understood, area
of cell cancer biology. Our lab previously demonstrated that STK25, a serine/threonine kinase, functions as an
upstream activator of Hippo signaling to limit cell growth. Using unbiased approaches, we have now generated
strong preliminary data suggesting that the STK25 kinase also functions to impair mTORC1 signaling. We have
found that that genetic depletion of STK25 leads to both mTORC1 pathway activation and Hippo pathway
inactivation. These data suggest that STK25 may play a critical role in regulating cell proliferation and tumor
suppression by coordinating the activities of both the mTORC1 and Hippo signaling pathways. However, the
mechanism by which STK25 regulates mTORC1 is unknown. In this proposal, we hypothesize that STK25
directly regulates and phosphorylates key regulatory components of the mTORC1 signaling pathway, ultimately
attenuating mTOR signaling. Further, our preliminary studies of STK25 knockout in mice demonstrate that
conditional depletion of STK25 is sufficient to induce tumorigenesis, which is congruent with bioinformatic
evidence that STK25 is significantly focally deleted in a variety of human cancers. Combining this with our in
vitro findings, we also hypothesize that STK25 deficient tumors are dependent on YAP/TAZ and/or mTORC1
activity for growth and survival. These hypotheses will be tested in two specific aims. In Aim 1, we will use cell
biological and biochemical approaches to mechanistically define the role of STK25 kinase in regulating mTORC1
activity by characterizing its direct phosphorylated substrates. In Aim 2, we will use a conditional STK25 knockout
mouse that we have already generated to determine if STK25 loss facilitates tumorigenesis through increased
YAP/TAZ and/or mTORC1 activity. Successful completion of these aims will advance our understanding of
mTORC1 and Hippo signaling, and reveal significant new insights into the underlying mechanisms driving tumor
development. Moreover, the proposed training plan will greatly enhance my repertoire of skills in microscopy and
imaging techniques, molecular cell biology, mouse cancer studies and liquid chromatography mass spectrometry
(LC-MS/MS) analysis. Altogether, this will facilitate the development of my scientific expertise in the fields of
mTOR and Hippo signaling in cancer biology required for success as an independent scientist.

 Filoviruses are prime examples of zoonotic viruses that cause fulminant hemorrhagic diseases in humans
and nonhuman primates (NHP), resulting in death in up to 90% of human case. The filoviridae family contains
six genera in which several species are known to have high fatality rates, all of which are within
the Marburgvirus or Ebolavirus genera and will therefore be the focus of this proposal. The largest ever 2014
Ebola virus (EBOV) disease outbreak in West Africa underscored the development and regulatory approval of
antiviral countermeasures, including an emergency-use vaccine and therapeutic monoclonal antibodies. While
these countermeasures are highly beneficial to block EBOV infection and interfere with disease progression at
early stages, they are less suitable for the treatment of late-stage EBOV disease (EVD), which is less studied.
Late-stage disease is characterized by gastrointestinal manifestations including diarrhea. At present, no
available animal models, including the classical NHP model, can recapitulate the gastrointestinal symptoms of
EVD patients. To elucidate the role of the intestinal epithelium in disease initiation and progression, we propose
to establish an intestinal filovirus infection model using human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC)-derived
human intestinal organoids (HIOs).
 We hypothesize that infection with EBOV and MARV compromises barrier integrity of the intestinal
epithelium and causes abnormal ion flux as the basis for gastrointestinal dysfunction and diarrhea. This
project proposes the establishment of a polarized 2-dimentional HIO transwell system that will be used to study
the pathophysiological effects of filovirus infection on intestinal epithelial integrity. In Aim 1, we will characterize
filovirus-mediated injury by analyzing (1) intestinal barrier and (2) tight junction integrity. We hypothesize that the
sepsis-like syndrome that occurs in some patients with severe disease may be due to loss of epithelial barrier
integrity in the intestine. In Aim 2, we intend to validate the role of individual genes by genetic ablation and test
potential drug candidates as modulators of intestinal epithelial function. We hypothesize that if tight junctions are
compromised in infected HIOs, then treatment with small molecule inhibitors targeted at ion exchanger would
reverse the leaky junctions by blocking the receptor responsible for the disassemble of the junction. The aims
proposed in this study will result in an improved model which more closely recapitulates in vivo intestinal epithelial
phenotypes, and thus can be used to inform novel therapeutics targeted at late-stage filovirus infection.
 The successful, longstanding mentorship of Drs. Mostoslavsky and Mühlberger, the collaborative support of
the CReM, the availability of the NEIDL research facilities and the rigorous MTM training program will provide
me with the tools and support needed to successfully complete my dissertation work. These departments instill
important values about the rigorous approach to academic science by supporting technical training, writing
workshops and seminar and lecture series.

Frailty is a state of depleted physiologic reserve that is common in older adults. To date there are no proven
therapies to prevent frailty beyond recommendations to adhere to a healthy lifestyle. Frailty is associated with
chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease (CVD), through shared pathophysiology mediated in part by
inflammation. Statins are the mainstay of CVD prevention and have effects beyond lipid lowering, including
reducing inflammation. Yet, many adults aged 75 and older are not taking statins due to a lack of evidence in
this age group. The ongoing PREVENTABLE trial will test the effect of atorvastatin 40mg vs placebo in 20,000
adults aged 75 and older free of CVD for the primary outcomes of survival free of dementia and disability, and
secondarily for incident CVD. However, whether statins can slow frailty has not been previously tested and is
not in the parent trial’s protocol. Thus, the proposed study is critical to establish whether statins may prevent or
slow the progression of frailty. PREVENTABLE provides a unique opportunity to test the effect of statins on
frailty using the two leading prevalent conceptual frameworks for quantifying frailty: the Rockwood cumulative
deficit frailty index (Rockwood FI) and Fried physical phenotype. As part of the parent trial, participants will
have a Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) performed at baseline and assessment of weight loss. A
funded Physical Performance ancillary study will support the administration of the SPPB at annual follow-up in
2500 participants and annual questionnaires will quantify other domains of frailty, including fatigue and physical
activity. The proposed PREVENTABLE Frailty Ancillary Study will complement the main trial by cleaning and
harmonizing EHR, claims, and trial data to calculate a Rockwood FI for all trial participants (n=20,000), and in
the Physical Performance subset (n=2,000), add annual grip strength and weight loss assessments to
complete the Fried phenotype. Finally, an annual blood sample will be collected in the same 2,000 participants
to measure markers of inflammation, neurodegeneration, and other measures to augment the Rockwood FI
with systematically collected routine labs, calculate a lab-FI, and examine Geroscience pathways to determine
the effect of statins on markers of inflammation and biologic aging. The frailty ancillary study will augment the
parent trial and existing ancillary study to determine whether statins: 1) lower the risk of incident frailty defined
according to the Rockwood FI in the entire trial population and Fried physical phenotype in a subset, and 2)
slow the progression of frailty over time according to the Rockwood FI in the entire trial population and Fried
phenotype in a subset. Finally, in the subset with annual blood samples, we will determine the effect of statins
on an FI augmented with labs and a lab-only FI. We will also explore the effect of statins on inflammation and
other hallmarks of aging. Leveraging the infrastructure of the PREVENTABLE trial and its Physical
Performance ancillary study, this timely and cost-effective proposal represents an exceptional opportunity to
test the possibility of statins as a treatment for frailty and biologic aging in a randomized setting.

Mosquito-borne disease is a major source of human misery, sickening hundreds of millions and killing
hundreds of thousands of people annually. The yellow fever mosquito Aedes aegypti is a primary vector for the
viruses that cause dengue, Zika and chikungunya and other diseases. In addition to its medical importance, Ae.
aegypti is increasingly used for molecular genetic studies of mosquito vector biology. Understanding Ae.
aegypti biology will provide basic science insights into this mosquito vector’s development, physiology and
behavior, help inform implementation of control efforts and potentially suggest new control strategies.
Improving approaches for genetic investigations in Ae. aegypti will facilitate these efforts.
 To date, genetic investigations in Ae. aegypti often rely on CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene targeting to
create strains of homozygous mutant animals in which a gene of interest has been disrupted. While extremely
valuable, substantial effort is required to create each mutant and the mutants obtained lack cell-specificity. To
address these limitations, we propose to establish a cell-specific, modified CRISPR/Cas9 (CmC) toolkit for Ae.
aegypti. CmC is designed to decrease the effort required to examine the impact of disrupting a gene of interest,
allow the cells in which a gene is acting to be determined and aid the study of essential genes.
We propose to achieve these goals in two aims:
Aim #1: Introduce the tools for Cell-specific modified CRISPR/Cas9 (CmC) into Ae. aegypti
In aim 1a, we design a strategy and build tools for creating mosquito strains that express modified Cas9
transgenes designed to allow optimization of Cas9 levels. In aim 1a2, we use these tools to create mosquitoes
that express modified Cas9 transgenes in a specific subset of sensory neurons. In aim 1b, we create transgenes
that express multiple gRNAs in a cell-specific fashion to specify the genes targeted.
Aim 2: Implement CmC in a subset of sensory neurons as well as pan-neuronally
In aim 2a, we test the system, using the tools built to identify an optimal strain which promotes robust cell-
specific gene disruption in a subset of sensory neurons, without causing cell death. In aim 2b, we construct
mosquito strains that will enable broad neuron-specific gene disruption, which should be of wide utility.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
Control of RNA metabolism is emerging as a major hub for regulation in the brain. Therefore, it is not
surprising that there is a strong link between perturbation of RNA metabolism and a number of neurological
and neurodegenerative diseases. These include Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) in which Tau protein and Aß42
fragments have been shown to interact and/or modulate directly or indirectly RNA binding proteins and RNA
metabolism in general. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are highly abundant RNAs produced by circularization of
specific exons. Interestingly, circRNAs accumulate in an age-dependent manner in neural tissues suggesting
their relevance to age-related homeostasis and/or pathogenesis. Indeed, specific circRNAs accumulate in
the brains of individuals with Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s diseases. However, how these circRNAs are
involved in the pathogenesis of those and other neurodegenerative diseases is largely unknown.
We recently developed systems to down- or up-regulate circRNAs in Drosophila. Using these tools, we
demonstrated the functionality of these molecules in vivo. We generated a resource to knock down (KD) the
110 more abundant circRNAs and found that KD of particular circRNAs results in different brain-related
phenotypes. Interestingly, we identified 35 circRNAs that when knocked down alter lifespan. Further data
shows that expression of some circRNAs is toxic for the aging fly, with links to aging and potentially
neurodegeneration. In addition, we found that KD of some circRNAs lead to specific behavioral and motor
defects, many of which are age-dependent. In addition, we observed changes in the levels of circRNAs in
Drosophila models of AD or other neurogenerative diseases. Here we aim to uncover the functions and
mechanisms of action of circRNAs during AD. To do so, we will use Drosophila AD models and perform a
genomic screening to determine if modulation of individual circRNAs can alter the progression and outcome
of the disease. Moreover, we will also test potential mechanisms by which circRNAs could alter AD including
nucleation of aggregates, altering mitochondrial function, autophagy, apoptosis, and/or inflammation.
In sum, the present proposal will reveal new roles of circRNAs during AD. As we will perform the
experiments in a system that has high and functional levels of circRNAs (the fly CNS) the present results will
be meaningful and could be later extended to mammalian models. We are aware of the limitations of the AD
fly models but this is the only system in which the full extent of interaction with a large number of circRNAs
can be assessed. Moreover, as we have already found that some circRNAs alter aging, the chances of
success are high. This will be a pioneering work in this new and important area of research and we are
confident that our findings will open a new pathway for studying the roles of circRNAs in AD. Our project
builds on exciting preliminary results and the unique and constantly evolving expertise of our group.

Transcription dominates the gene expression landscape of circadian rhythms and a number of neuroscience
areas. Yet post-transcriptional regulation, including translational regulation and the role of RNA binding
proteins (RBPs), has become increasingly recognized as important in recent years. Moreover, understanding
the roles of RBPs in diverse cell types and diseases and ultimately therapeutic intervention requires identifying
the RNA targets of RBPs. The ribosome can be considered a RBP, so this focus on post-transcriptional
regulation and RBP targets includes identifying ribosome-associated transcripts, namely RNAs that change
their translational status under defined circumstances. RBP identification is particularly challenging from small
numbers of cells, e.g., cancer stem cells within a large, heterogeneous solid tumor or discrete neuronal
subtypes. These settings preclude traditional biochemistry and therefore require new approaches. Two new
methods recently appeared, TRIBE and STAMP, which exploit the RNA editing enzymes ADAR and APOBEC,
respectively. Their ribosome versions, Ribo-STAMP and Ribo-TRIBE, are even more recent and fuse a
ribosomal protein to the editing enzymes. This is so that the enzyme will be near RNAs that are being
translated and will “mark” them by changing their sequence. These edits are identified by mRNA sequencing
and straightforward computational methods, even from single cells. We propose to compare Ribo-STAMP and
Ribo-TRIBE side-by-side in mammalian cell culture systems, to assess their efficacy and to determine the
optimal configuration of ribosome-editing enzyme fusions. We also propose to develop Ribo-TRIBE for use in
Drosophila; we recently discovered that STAMP does not work in this organism, which limits us to TRIBE. We
will then extend these methods to the more biological context of neurons, from Drosophila as well as from
mouse brains. To complement these efforts, we will develop an extension of the TRIBE/STAMP theme called
Nanobody-editing. It consists of fusing the editing enzyme, ADAR or APOBEC, to a GFP-nanobody, which will
then deliver the editing enzyme to any GFP-tagged RNA binding protein or GFP-tagged ribosome. The
chimeric, recombinant protein will be used in vitro as a recombinant protein or expressed in vivo. Nanobody-
editing will facilitate identifying RBP and ribosome targets, because already existing GFP-tagged RBP or
ribosomes can serve as substrates. Moreover, in vitro editing will in many cases obviate the need to generate
new transgenes and transgenic animals. Lastly, TRIBE and as well as Ribo-TRIBE will be used to characterize
translational regulation “around the clock” within a few key Drosophila circadian neurons. These efforts will
deepen our understanding of circadian gene expression regulation as well as provide the community with new
tools with which to study translation in important but challenging biological systems.

Neurons have classically been defined by the neurotransmitter they release. This “identity” has
been considered to be both singular (i.e. one transmitter) and immutable (i.e. genetically
hardwired). While the astonishing prevalence of cotransmission has changed thinking about the
singularity of neurotransmitter identity there has been considerably less appreciation of the
ability of neurons to exhibit plasticity in their expression. Recently, we discovered that the
microRNA miR-190 is a potent regulator of adult sleep. Spatial and temporal mapping of its site
of action demonstrates that it is required during pupation in a population of cells that transcribes
both cholinergic and glutamatergic genes but differentiates to become a small subset of the
adult glutamatergic neurons. This subset includes components of the core sleep homeostasis
circuit. We will test the hypothesis that a neurotransmitter plasticity event is critical to function of
the mature circuit and that it provides a novel mechanism for establishing, and potentially
modifying, the sleep set-point of the homeostatic machinery.
Aim 1 will determine the role of neurotransmitter plasticity in the control of adult sleep, with a
focus on understanding the circuit-level changes.
Aim 2 will investigate the role of neuronal activity in transmitter switching and homeostat
plasticity, with a focus on understanding the molecular events.
In this proposal, we bring the power of Drosophila genetics to bear on this novel and important
type of plasticity. We demonstrate that programmed transmitter plasticity during pupal life is
crucial to adult function of the sleep circuitry. The genetic reagents we have developed will allow
us to address basic mechanisms underlying transmitter plasticity in the context of both the
developing and mature nervous systems and, for the first time, link this type of plasticity to
sleep.

The goal of this proposal is to understand how cellular membrane trafficking machinery controls the packaging
and release of extracellular vesicle (EV) cargoes from synapses in vivo. EVs are small membrane-bound
vesicles released by numerous cell types, including neurons, carrying cargoes critical for signaling and
disease. However, we understand very little about how EV cargo traffic is spatially and temporally regulated
within the polarized and complex morphology of neurons. We have developed tools to track and manipulate EV
traffic at Drosophila presynaptic terminals in vivo, and discovered that flux of cargoes through a plasma
membrane-recycling endosome route determines whether they are locally sorted for packaging and release in
EVs, rather than depleted from synapses by retrograde transport. Recycling endosomes have primarily been
studied in non-neuronal cells, and very little is known about their lifetime, functions, or dynamics at presynaptic
terminals. We do know that recycling endosomes play critical roles in signaling, neuronal morphogenesis, EV
traffic, and synaptic transmission. Understanding and therapeutically intervening in these important processes
will require a deeper knowledge of the mechanisms of neuronal recycling endosome function. In this proposal,
we will elucidate the mechanisms of synaptic EV cargo and recycling endosome traffic in vivo. To achieve
these goals, we will use Drosophila genetics, biochemistry, high-resolution microscopy, and live cell imaging.
1) We will determine the functions, dynamics, and regulation of different types of synaptic recycling
endosomes. To this end, we will develop new tools and approaches to define and control functionally distinct
recycling compartments at synapses. Using these tools, we will test novel mechanistic hypotheses for how
membrane traffic machinery sorts cargoes at synaptic recycling compartments. 2) We will determine how EV
cargo traffic depends on distinct modes of synaptic endocytosis: clathrin-mediated endocytosis, which operates
under low neuronal activity and activity-dependent bulk endocytosis, which operates during intense neuronal
activity. These experiments will ascertain if EV fate is determined by different modes of internalization, how
recycling endosomes contribute to these functions, and provide new mechanisms to link activity, endosomal
traffic, and EV release. Given the conserved nature of synaptic membrane trafficking machinery, our findings
and tools will lay the foundation for new insights into EV traffic in many aspects of nervous system function,
including in human neurological disease.

The hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex (PFC) are both critical for learning and memory-guided behavior.
Coordination of neural activity between these regions is necessary for memory and cognitive processes,
however, the nature of these interactions and their roles are still unclear. We have established multiple timescale
neural representations in these regions for spatial learning and memory-guided behavior, with inter-regional
coordination during spatial firing and theta oscillations in exploratory behavior, and during sharp-wave ripple
(SWR) associated replay in sleep and awake immobility periods. Here, we will investigate the roles of these
physiological network patterns in learning and memory-guided navigation by combining behavioral methods in
rats, high-density recordings, and causal manipulation methods. (Aim 1) The influence of reward on mnemonic
representations is key to understanding the role of hippocampal-prefrontal activity patterns in memory-guided
behavior. In particular, it is known that reward changes influence hippocampal replay, and replay is thought to
play a role in linking actions to reward for reinforcement learning. To address this question directly, we have
developed methods in TH-Cre rats for optogenetic tagging and identification of dopaminergic ventral tegmental
area (VTA) neurons which encode reward prediction error, simultaneously with recordings from hippocampal
and prefrontal ensembles. We will record and manipulate VTA dopamine neuron firing to examine the influence
on replay and task representations in the hippocampal-prefrontal network during learning of new spatial rules.
(Aim 2) The hippocampus and prefrontal cortex are both known to be important for contextual encoding and
generalizing experiences across contexts, but the mechanisms are unclear. Our preliminary data show rule-
selective encoding by prefrontal neurons that is maintained across spatial contexts, whereas hippocampal CA1
neurons remap across contexts. Further, we have also found coordinated hippocampal-prefrontal ripples vs
independent cortical ripples with distinct reactivation patterns. We will examine whether hippocampal-prefrontal
ensembles underlie rule representations and contextual encoding, whether theta sequences maintain encoding
of current context, and test the hypothesis that replay during coordinated ripples enables associations across
contexts. (Aim 3) Goal representations are considered central to navigation, but the mechanisms for goal coding
and hippocampal-prefrontal representations for memory-guided navigation are still unclear. Our preliminary data
using a complex 2-d maze with flexible goal locations and barriers supports goal representations and replay by
hippocampal and prefrontal ensembles during navigation. We will test the hypotheses that hippocampal and
prefrontal replay events during immobility support planning of upcoming trajectories, and goal representations
impact theta sequences for online maintenance during trajectory execution. Overall, our results will provide novel
insight into fundamental learning and memory mechanisms that are affected in aging and memory disorders
such as Alzheimer’s disease.

 Despite the progress in molecular therapy and immunotherapy, multiple underlying cellular mechanisms
cause resistance to cancer therapy. There are urgent needs to develop innovative approaches to meet these
challenges. The proposed study is to develop subcellular enzyme-instructed self-assembly (sEISA), which
includes mitochondrial EISA (mitoEISA) and cytoplasmic EISA (cytoEISA), for generating molecular nanofibers
to overcome drug resistance and immunosuppression in cancer therapy. Our preliminary studies have shown
that sEISA selectively targets the mitochondria of cancer cells and minimizes drug resistance. Most importantly,
our preliminary study shows that sEISA inhibits the growth of immunosuppressive tumors in vivo. Thus, we
propose to further develop sEISA against drug resistant cancer cells and tumors. The proposed research has
three specific aims: Aim 1, developing mitoEISA for selectively targeting cancer cells; Aim 2, developing
cytoEISA for minimizing drug resistance and immunosuppression; and Aim 3, evaluating sEISA in ovarian
cancer xenograft murine models. The central hypothesis is that sEISA spatiotemporally generates molecular
nanofibers, which interact with multiple cellular proteins and interrupt multiple cellular processes inside cancer
cells to minimize drug resistance. Our preliminary results support the central hypothesis. The innovation is that
the mechanisms of the action of the molecular nanofibers significantly depart from the ligand-receptor dogma of
the current anticancer drugs. The long-term goal of the proposed work is to develop sEISA to generate molecular
nanofibers for overcoming resistance in cancer therapy. We anticipate that this research will provide innovative
anticancer approaches to address the problems of drug resistance and immunosuppression in cancer therapy,
thus ultimately will improve the survivorship of cancer patients.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Black Americans demonstrably suffer from a range of health disparities rising from a long history of
structural inequities and racism. Although Black Americans are slightly less likely to drink alcohol than the
general population, the rate of Black drinkers with alcohol use disorders (AUD) is comparable, representing 1.5
million Black Americans with AUD. Blacks suffer more negative consequences due to alcohol use such as
illnesses, injuries, criminal-legal involvement, and social problems. Recovery is a dynamic process of behavior
change leading to stable improvements in functioning, purpose and well-being. NIAAA further highlights
recovery as remission from AUD symptoms as well as cessation of heavy drinking. Recovery support services
and recovery community organizations aim to build recovery capital. Yet, to date little effort has been made to
consider recovery within population groups rather than across groups. A “centering in the margins” approach
emphasizes the need to examine experiences of racialized and minoritized populations. This proposed study to
advance recovery pathways and support services for Black men and women heeds that call. It is directly
responsive to RFA-AA-21-001 in its emphasis on health disparities in AUD populations, intersecting with the
RFA goals to advance culturally-informed measures and interventions, increase access to AUD services, make
services more appealing, and evaluate evidence-based practices. We do this with a focus on Black men and
women in AUD recovery. We thus aim to iteratively use quantitative and qualitative methods to capture and
assess questions related to AUD recovery in a heterogenous Black population, in partnership with a Black-
majority recovery community organization in Detroit. Specifically: (1) Use qualitative methods with a Black
population to (a) define AUD recovery pathways; (b) assess and refine a measure of recovery domains (e.g.,
relationships, living environment); and (c) identify and map community indicators that may facilitate or interfere
with AUD recovery. (2) Use quantitative methods to describe and assess the provision of AUD recovery
support services provided by the recovery community organization in terms of matching to needs, stage of
recovery and other client and community characteristics, by race/ethnicity. (3) Conduct a pragmatic
randomized controlled trial that builds on Aims 1 and 2 with a Black AUD recovery population, compared to a
treatment as usual group with in-person recovery support services, to determine the effectiveness of an added
phone+digital recovery support service intervention (i.e., provision of smartphones and guidance/support for
online recovery activities). The proposed study will enable a deep understanding of what recovery means to
Black men and women, how it can be measured, and how we can advance recovery journeys of Black
Americans with AUD. The results will be meaningful to Black individuals themselves, providers who treat
Blacks who have AUD, and to researchers and policymakers who need to better understand the meaning and
needs of a heterogenous US population.

 It is essential for the fate of an organism that key morphogenetic processes occur reproducibly even
under tissue damage or environmental perturbations. While much is known about how genetic redundancy and
regulation achieves robust development, less is understood about how a tissue mechanically ensures
reproducible shape change when perturbed. This project uncovers how populations of physically interacting
cells mechanically respond to challenging conditions and modify their collective behavior to still sculpt the
correct final shape.
 One way for cells to coordinate tissue-scale forces and movements is through direct mechanical
connections. In fact, many developing tissues exhibit supracellular networks of actomyosin connections that
link hundreds of cells. A large roadblock has been with the challenges of imaging and quantifying subcellular
protein at the tissue scale. I adapted a topological smoothing algorithm originally used to trace high-noise
filamentous structure of galaxies in the Universe to data to trace high-noise filamentous myosin structure in
confocal images. This allowed for the first quantification of a supracellular myosin network across an entire
tissue over developmental time. Subsequent analysis adopting techniques from network theory allowed me to
identify that the robust folding of the Drosophila fruit fly embryo during ventral furrow formation is mechanically
ensured by patterns in the supracellular network spanning its ventral cells.
 This newly discovered importance of supracellular networks in coordinating robust shape change
highlights the need for a comprehensive understanding of how supracellular networks form, and how their
patterns impact the function and robustness of a population of cells. Deciphering robustness at the tissue-level,
where the displacement and fate of hundreds of cells must be considered, requires techniques at the interface
of cell and developmental biology, biophysics and computer science. The proposed project will take a highly
interdisciplinary approach to identify how supracellular network patterns are controlled molecularly, at the cell
level, and via tissue constraints. As well, how heterogeneity in tissue-level patterns impacts morphogenetic
robustness will be addressed. Together this comprehensive study of the structure and function of supracellular
networks will represent a new way to interpret mechanical robustness across diverse developing tissues. As
well, a generalized description of mechanical robustness has the potential to uncover new paths to predict and
control tissue malformation, which would represent a significant advance for both developmental biology and
fetal medicine.

We like to think of taste as working relatively simply—a sweet taste is recognized as sweet by
virtue of activating certain cells on the tongue, and that information is used to drive neurons that
cause us to eat more of whatever food is in our mouths. The truth, however, is much more
interesting: a taste hits the tongue, and complex circuits in the brain go into action, passing
food-related information back and forth as the system as a whole decides whether the morsel is
palatable enough to swallow. My lab studies this process by recording from multiple parts of the
taste system while active rats are sampling various tastes. We have observed this decision-
making process in action in taste cortex, where neural ensembles report, in turn, that a taste is
on the tongue, that the taste is (say) sugar, and that it (the rat) currently likes the taste; this last
step appears to be one arrived at suddenly, in a moment of insight—the food rolls around in the
rat’s mouth for 0.5-1.5 seconds, and then the decision is made. This process clearly involves
and requires cortex, but it is just as clear that cortex doesn’t work alone. Here, we will do
rigorous tests of where that information in cortex comes from (specifically examining the roles
played by amygdala and hypothalamus), in the process revealing novel systems-level
mechanisms of taste processing. As a whole, this research project has the potential to
completely change the way we think about taste, and to usher in new thinking about perception
in general—thinking that makes a great deal more biological sense, given the complexity of
brain circuitry.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
Regulation of RNA metabolism is emerging as a major regulatory hub for gene expression control in tissues
like the brain and the muscle, which don’t undergo cell division. Therefore, it is not surprising that there is a
strong link between perturbation of RNA metabolism and a number of muscular and neurodegenerative
diseases including myotonic dystrophy (MD) and amyotrophic lateral dystrophy (ALS). For example, MD- 1
is provoked by the sequestration of the splicing factor MBNL1 encoded by the gene muscleblind-1. MBNL1
and another member of the MBL family (MBNL2) have important and overlapping functions in RNA
processing and transport, in particular in muscle and neurons.
Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a highly abundant, not well-characterized type of non-coding RNA. These
RNAs are generated by circularization of specific exons, and their functionality is still controversial. Recent
work from my laboratory has demonstrated that circRNA production competes with pre-mRNA splicing,
suggesting that circRNAs are general cis regulators of gene expression. We found by studying of MBL, the
Drosophila homolog of MBNL1, that this protein regulates the production of a subset of circRNAs, including
one generated from its own locus (circMbl). Work from the previous period demonstrated that circRNAs
generated from the mbl locus regulate gene expression, physiology and behavior. We found that these
circRNAs act in cis and are part of a self-regulatory loop that limits MBL expression. In addition, we found
that circMbl has functions in trans as knockdown (KD) of circMbl provokes several developmental,
physiological and behavioral phenotypes which are distinct but related to the ones observed upon MBL KD.
Together, our data demonstrates that circMbl and MBL work in related pathways but have distinct functions.
Here we aim to unravel the molecular and physiological implications of circMbl production and
function. This work will result in pioneering functional characterization of circRNAs in vivo and will be key for
understanding how MBL production and function are regulated in vivo. For doing so we will: identify MBL-
dependent and MBL-independent mechanisms of action of circMbl. We will follow by determining the
physiological and neural roles of mbl and circMbl isoforms. This project will illuminate essential
regulatory mechanisms of mbl expression and function. As or more importantly, this project is both technically
and intellectually innovative in its analysis of the roles of circRNAs in central aspects of physiology, and
behavior. Our project builds on strong preliminary results and the unique and constantly evolving expertise
of our group.

This proposal aims to determine how the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is regulated in neurons at rest and during
neuronal activity. The ER is a contiguous membrane-bound compartment, which forms a network of tubules that
extends to the periphery of neurons and forms contacts with other organelles, controlling processes such as lipid
transfer, organelle scission, and calcium signaling. Patients with neurodegenerative disorders, such as
Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia (HSP), often have mutations in genes that disrupt ER structure and ER contacts.
However, our understanding of ER function in neurons primarily comes from studies of non-neuronal cells. The
complex morphologies and elongated structures of neurons impose unique challenges for secretory and
endosomal membrane trafficking pathways. In particular, endosomes are vital for conveying long-distance
signals within neurons and packaging cargoes for intercellular signaling through extracellular vesicles. We
currently know very little about how ER contacts regulate neuronal endosomal compartments, or how the
structure of the neuronal ER is modified by activity. This project will use Drosophila and mammalian neuronal
systems to examine ER-endosome contacts in neurons and to study how neuronal activity regulates the ER.
The Drosophila neuromuscular junction is an excellent system to study the ER because it is genetically tractable,
and easily accessible for live imaging and electrophysiology. On the other hand, mammalian neuronal cultures
provide homogeneous material for biochemical studies, and can show if findings in Drosophila are evolutionarily
conserved. First, this proposal will determine how the HSP-linked gene Atlastin, which controls the assembly of
the ER into a reticular network, affects ER-endosome contacts in Drosophila and mammalian neurons (Aim1a,c).
Atlastin mutant synapses will be examined to uncover the mechanistic basis of the observed structural and
dynamic defects in the ER, as well as the accumulation of endosomal and extracellular vesicle cargoes (Aim1b).
Next, this study will examine how different neuronal activity paradigms (e.g. spontaneous vs. mild vs strong
stimulation) regulate the dynamics of the ER and ER-endosome contacts in Drosophila (Aim2a). Finally,
proximity labeling approaches will also be used in hippocampal neurons to identify candidate proteins at ER
contacts that are regulated by neuronal activity, to lay the foundation for future functional studies in Drosophila
(Aim2b). To achieve these research goals, the proposed training plan will expand the PI’s experimental skillsets
in various microscopy techniques, construction of genetic sensors, mammalian neuronal culture, and new coding
skills for image analysis such as image restoration and particle tracking. The career development plan focuses
on strengthening the PI's publication record, transitioning to an independent research position, and promoting
diversity, equity, and inclusion in science. Overall, the MOSAIC K99/R00 will allow the PI to gain necessary skills
to become an independent researcher in the field of neuronal cell biology and membrane trafficking.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Respiratory viral pathogens have been responsible for major pandemics over the past two centuries with
extraordinary human and economic cost. While most vaccines have focused on antibody neutralization of
virus, there has been growing interest in targeting CD8 T cell immunity for more durable protective immune
memory. Specifically, there has been interest in vaccines that generate tissue resident memory T cells (TRM),
but one issue complicating this approach is the observed lack of durability of lung TRM, whether generated by
pulmonary viral infection or targeted vaccination. Unlike TRM in other tissues, which accumulate and survive for
years, lung TRM have half-lives measured in days. We have discovered an alternative population of CD8 TM that
can mediate lung-focused T cell memory and protection from morbidity and mortality after skin vaccination.
The durability of this immunity appears to be provided by a unique population of lung tropic CD8 T cells
concentrated in the intravascular space of the lung (rather than the parenchyma). Using IAV as a model viral
respiratory pathogen, these CD8 T cells appear to rapidly extravasate and enter lung parenchyma within hours
after infection, providing a rapid on demand protective memory response with kinetics comparable to lung TRM.
Their activity does not require CD4 T cells, and elimination of these CD8 TM cells completely abrogates robust
vaccine protection. Analysis of these cells by scRNAseq reveals that they have circulatory markers, but also
immediate-early genes reminiscent of skin TRM generated from the same vaccination. They are transcriptionally
distinct from spleen TEM and LN TCM generated by the same vaccination and appear to be robust >6 months
later. Most importantly, they provide complete protection from morbidity and mortality from viral lung challenge
and function independently of antibodies and B cells. Using defined genetic models, scRNA seq, ATACseq,
multidimensional flow cytometry, and lung intravital microscopy, we will test key hypotheses about the mode of
generation, in vivo biological behavior, and protective immunity of these cells. We have assembled expert
collaborators in each of these areas to fully explore the biology of these cells and the potential of generating
these cells by epidermal disruption (ed) vaccination. We believe that these TM cells are an important and
unstudied component of normal T cell memory designed to provide superior and long-lasting lung immunity
without occupying valuable lung parenchymal space. We believe that optimized generation of these cells by
improved vaccination approaches will provide a superior way to combat respiratory viral pathogens.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:
Recent FDA accelerated approvals of two anti-amyloid antibody treatments, aducanumab and lecanemab, for
early-stage Alzheimer’s disease (AD) provide the first disease-modifying treatments to date, albeit with moderate
slowing of cognitive decline, and vascular side effects known as Amyloid Related Imaging Abnormalities due to
edema (ARIA-E) or microhemorrhages (ARIA-H) in ~12-35% of patients, especially ApoE4 carriers. While the
cause of ARIA is unknown, it has been suggested that Ab clearance by anti-amyloid antibodies is mediated by
perivascular drainage which may transiently lead to amyloid accumulating in the blood vessel wall and inducing
inflammation, which in turn may increase BBB breakdown, leading to edema or microhemorrhages (Cogswell et
al., 2022). Therefore, there is still a large unmet need to improve cognitive efficacy and safety of anti-amyloid
immunotherapy. Semaglutide is a Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor (GLP-1R) agonist, that is FDA approved
for the treatment of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and obesity, that has strong anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective and
pro-vascular health effects. Previous studies have shown beneficial effects of semaglutide in stroke models,
diabetes models, LPS models and other disease models. Novo Nordisk, the inventor of semaglutide, is
conducting two large Phase 3a clinical trials to test the efficacy of semaglutide in early-stage AD (EVOKE,
EVOKE+). While other GLP-1R agonists have shown benefits in AD mouse models, semaglutide, a longer lasting
form, has not yet been tested in amyloid AD mouse models. The goal of this project is to determine whether the
combination of semaglutide with anti-amyloid antibody therapy will enhance the efficacy beyond that of either
treatment alone and attenuate the vascular side effects seen with anti-amyloid antibodies. We propose the
following 3 Aims: 1. We hypothesize that semaglutide alone will reduce or reverse inflammation and
neurodegeneration and spare cognition in 2 amyloid AD-like mouse models: 5XE4 mice which overexpress
human mutant APP/PS1 on a human ApoE4/4 background and APPSAA knockin mice which express physiologic
levels of human mutant APP. Mice will be dosed for 12 weeks at 2 ages – pre-plaque and after robust plaque
and vascular amyloid accumulation. 2. We hypothesize that combination therapy with semaglutide and anti-
amyloid antibodies (murine versions of lecanemab and donanemab) will enhance efficacy compared to either
treatment alone in the 5XE4 model which develops abundant plaques, vascular amyloid, inflammation and
cognitive decline with aging. 3. We hypothesize that acute semaglutide co-treatment with a murine precursor to
bapineuzumab (3D6) shown to cause a high amount of ARIA, will mitigate microhemorrhagic side effects in aged
5XE4 mice. Outcomes include behavioral testing, pathological and biochemical measures, bulk RNAseq and in-
depth analysis of transcriptomic changes within cell populations in cortex and hippocampus, and mapping of the
mouse data to human data available on the NIH-sponsored AMP-AD portal. If successful, combination trials in
humans could be initiated to improve the efficacy and safety of anti-amyloid antibody immunotherapy.

 Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the most common cause of dementia, is accompanied by progressive
neurodegeneration and stereotypic deposition of misfolded amyloid β- (Aβ) and tau proteins. However, the
basis for cellular dysfunction in AD is not well understood, underscoring an important need to broaden the
biologic scope of AD research. Technological advances, based on single-cell whole-genome sequencing
(scWGS) on frozen postmortem human brain tissue, now allow examination of previously inaccessible aspects
of the genome of individual cells in the brain. Recent research from our group has found that neurons in
individuals with AD show greater somatic single-nucleotide variants (sSNV) in their genomes than in
individuals without AD. Using mutational signature analysis, our study also found that the specific causes of
somatic mutations differed in AD, implicating oxidative stress and signal suggesting other cytopathologic
events.
 This study aims to understand neuronal somatic mutation in AD at a deeper level, to probe how disease
progression and protein misfolding impact the burden and signatures of sSNV. The first aim will examine
neurons from individuals with different pathologic stages of AD. This will give us a better understanding of
when somatic mutations develop in disease, and whether certain mutagenic events occur with distinct timing in
the development of AD. The second aim will study how intracellular tau pathology relates to somatic mutation,
utilizing a novel method to separate individual nuclei according to tau tangle formation. In applying this method
to specific brain regions at specific pathologic stages at the forefront of AD progression, we will be able to
determine if somatic mutation is tied to tau pathology at the level of individual cells. In the final aim, we will test
whether Aβ trigger somatic mutation, using a human iPSC-derived neuronal cellular model and incubation with
human brain-derived Aβ oligomers.
 With complementary approaches of novel scWGS technology, single-nucleus sorting, and specific human
tissues and and cellular systems, we will examine the mechanistic role of neuronal somatic mutations in AD.
This examination of the interplay between disease progression, protein misfolding, and the landscape of
somatic mutations will be an important step in understanding the molecular causes of AD. Moreover, the
capability of somatic mutational signature analysis to reveal previously unrecognized disease mechanisms
lends additional promise toward development of better treatments and cures.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
 The overall goal of this proposal is to systematically characterize the cellular functions of
transcription factor isoforms. Transcription factors (TFs) are master regulators of gene expression and as
such play key roles in a variety of biological processes, including cell growth and differentiation. The human
genome is estimated to harbor ~1600 TF genes; however, most of these are expressed as a series of protein
isoforms arising from mRNAs with alternative starts, ends, or splicing. Though a handful of alternative TF
isoforms are known to play functionally important (and distinct) roles in the cell, the overwhelming majority—
thousands of proteins—remain entirely uncharacterized. Moreover, splicing aberrations are a hallmark of
cancer, and mis-expression of TF isoforms can contribute to tumorigenesis. Thus, decoding the roles of TF
isoforms is key to a systems-level understanding of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) in development and
disease. In my previous work, I found widespread changes in DNA binding, protein-protein interactions, and
transcriptional activation in exogenous assays across a collection of >700 TF isoforms. These results
underscore the need to perturb and characterize TF isoforms in their endogenous cellular context to truly
understand their roles in GRNs.
 Functional genomics approaches such as high throughput perturbation screens have revolutionized our
understanding of gene functions. I aim to apply and extend these functional genomics approaches to
study isoforms, which have remained elusive due to technical limitations. I propose to use a combination of
state-of-the-art genomic technologies to decode the functions of TF isoforms in breast cancer cells. I will
leverage long read RNA-sequencing to perform rigorous isoform-aware analyses (Aim 1) and isoform-specific
high throughput experiments (Aims 2 and 3). In Aim 1, I will re-analyze existing CRISPR/Cas9 knock-out
databases from the Cancer Dependency Map Consortium to identify candidate isoform-specific phenotypes in
breast cancer. In Aim 2, I will establish a platform for robust and specific knock-down of individual isoforms in
mammalian cells using RNA-targeting CRISPR/Cas systems. In Aim 3, I will use tunable libraries of TF ORFs
to quantitatively tune isoform expression across a range of physiological levels. The proposed work includes
technology development in the mentored K99 phase, which I will then leverage during the independent R00
phase to probe the mechanisms of TF isoform function in breast cancer via single-cell screening approaches.
 Successful execution of these aims will begin to decode the “dark matter” of alternative TF isoforms,
laying a foundation for future studies of alternative isoforms more broadly. By combining new training in high-
throughput screening approaches during the K99 phase with my existing expertise in gene regulation, TF
biology, and bioinformatics, this transition to independence award will position me well to start my own
research group that uses interdisciplinary genomic methods to probe GRNs in development and disease.

The long-term objective of this project is to develop Dr. Romanos-Nanclares’s capacity to conduct studies that
integrate dietary and lifestyle factors with multi-omics data and traditional biomarkers to better understand the
biological pathways underlying the etiology of aggressive forms of breast cancer and to advance the field of
precision nutrition for cancer prevention. The proposed research combines ‘omics methodologies with advanced
statistical techniques to investigate the role of chronic inflammation in the etiology of breast cancer. Chronic
inflammation has been identified as a possible risk factor in the development of breast cancer, including estrogen
receptor negative breast cancer, which is a subtype of breast cancer that is associated with poorer prognosis
and is less responsive to hormonal therapies. The foundation for this proposal is based on our recent findings
where a higher adherence to an Empirical Dietary Inflammatory Pattern (EDIP) score (or a more pro-
inflammatory diet) was associated with increased breast cancer risk, particularly for tumors lacking estrogen
receptor expression. Leveraging the unique design and wealth of resources in the Nurses’ Health Study (NHS)
and Nurses’ Health Study II (NHSII), with repeated dietary measures and prediagnostic plasma specimens, this
application will combine dietary and ‘omics data from multiple biological dimensions with cutting-edge
epidemiological and bioinformatics methodologies to examine the relationship between chronic inflammation and
invasive breast cancer risk and estrogen receptor subtypes. In Aim 1 (K99), she will examine the associations
of plasma metabolomic profiles of EDIP with subsequent risk of breast cancer in the NHS and NHSII among
1,997 cases and their matched controls. In Aim 2 (R00), she will use an agnostic approach to identify the
associations of plasma proteomics with risk of breast cancer in the NHS and NHSII among 200 cases and their
matched controls. In Aim 3 (R00), she will integrate multi-omics data, including metabolomics, proteomics, and
transcriptomics, to characterize the role of inflammation in breast cancer etiology. This research will provide
novel evidence, enhance our understanding of the biological mechanisms involved in breast cancer etiology,
and help identify new prevention strategies for more aggressive forms of the disease. Dr. Romanos-Nanclares’s
scientific aims are supported by three training objectives that will allow her to advance her trajectory toward
becoming an independent investigator: 1) single-omics and multi-omics methodologies and advanced analytics;
2) proteomics study design and execution; and 3) breast cancer etiology and pathophysiology. The training
environment at Brigham and Women’s Hospital will provide exceptional support for Dr. Romanos-Nanclares as
she pursues these development and scientific goals. She has assembled an outstanding interdisciplinary
mentoring team with expertise in cancer epidemiology, multi-omics bioinformatics, breast cancer pathology,
proteomics, and metabolomics. This K99/R00 award will help Dr. Romanos-Nanclares acquire the knowledge
and experience necessary to launch her career as an independent investigator.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Project Summary
Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a heterogeneous condition that occurs most frequently as complicating
comorbidity of very common disease in the western world, including COPD, heart failure, and blood clots in the
lung. In patients with PH secondary to COPD (Group III) mortality risk is about twice as high than in patients with
COPD and normal pulmonary artery pressure. Medications developed successfully for Group I disease have not
shown much utility in Group III PH. Additionally, non-invasive screening and early detection remain challenging.
For this reason, etiology and evolution of PH are still poorly understood and the response to potential
interventions is very difficult to measure.
In recent years, radiologists have been making observation of the loss of distal vasculature (pruning), increased
vascular “tortuosity”, and proximal vascular dilation in patients with PH. In this career development proposal, we
hypothesize that the great power and recent advances in artificial intelligence can be leveraged to identify new
functional and structural markers that define the presence of PH in smokers from non-contrast CT images. These
CT-based features will significantly improve our ability to define the main structural and functional effects of PH
in COPD patients and assess pathological conditions, leading to a better understanding of the genetic and
biological underpinnings of the disease.
Aim 1 of this application involves refining our algorithm for vascular morphology assessment and applying it to
investigate how the pulmonary vasculature is affected in presence of PH Group III. Five markers of presence of
disease will be explored. The goal of Aim 2 is to develop an innovative approach to assess the level of pulmonary
perfusion from non-contrast non cardiac gated CT images and to apply it to explore new functional markers of
disease. Both in Aims 1 and 2 association with biological outcomes will be performed. Finally, in Aim 3 we will
validate the biological relevance of the endpoints determined in Aims 1 and 2 by performing common and rare
variant association studies.
Preliminary data obtained with our published methods show promising results. We show that using artificial
intelligence we can effectively segment pulmonary vessels, separate arteries and veins, and measure small
vessels with an accuracy which outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, we developed an innovative
technique that synthesized perfusion maps from non-contrast CT to assess perfusion defects in PH patients.
Together, the research proposed in the aims of this award will take full advantage of the comprehensive dataset
available through the COPDGene study. The execution of the aims in this proposal will be possible through
active collaboration with Dr. Raul San Jose Estepar, Ph.D. as the mentor and an outstanding Advisory Committee
including renowned leaders in the fields of medical image analysis, translational research, quantitative imaging
in pulmonary vascular disease, and the genetic epidemiology of COPD.

Although neuronavigation systems are of crucial assistance during cerebrovascular surgery, they do not
integrate hemodynamics information needed to treat complex cerebrovascular malformations. The present
project aims at developing an Augmented Reality (AR) neuronavigation tool that will enable the visualization of
cerebral hemodynamics information in the surgical view. Our long-term goal is to contribute toward the
development and clinical adoption of visualization tools that allow for safe and accurate treatment of
cerebrovascular malformations. Our overall objectives in this project are to (i) develop a novel approach based
on deep neural networks that can classify and reconstruct 3D dynamic cerebral vasculature from 2D Digital
Subtraction Angiography (DSA) image series, (ii) compose an AR visualization that will enhance the surgical
view of the brain, and (iii) validate and evaluate our technology in real clinical settings. The rationale for this
project is that such technology will provide a clear and interpretable visualization tool to surgeons that will
support their decision-making process and reduce the time and complex spatial reasoning required to treat
cerebrovascular malformations. To attain the overall objectives, the following three specific aims will be
pursued: 1) develop and validate a method to classify artery and veins in DSA image series to visually
disentangle AVMs, 2) develop and validate a method to build dynamic, virtual 3D model of cerebral vasculature
from pairs of DSA image series and 3) build an AR visualization that aligns DSA image series with the surgical
view and assess its impact providing surgical guidance. In addition, we will examine, through a clinical
retrospective study, and through tests in the operating room on phantom data, the impact of this visualization in
providing surgeons with guidance during cerebrovascular surgery. The proposed project is innovative because
it will be possible to merge the true DSA-derived 3D cerebral hemodynamics with images of the brain surface
seen through a surgical microscope. The proposed project is significant because it will provide visual guidance
and confirmation to surgeons that will facilitate decision-making in the surgical treatment of complex AVMs.
The results are expected to have an important positive impact because they will provide novel neuronavigation
tools to improve the surgical treatment of cerebrovascular malformations and ultimately reduce the risks of
intraoperative hemorrhaging and postsurgical deficits. Furthermore, the methods described here are
cost-effective, adapted to low-resources settings, and can be easily implemented on a large scale, bringing
advanced imaging techniques to far more patients.

Lung diseases exhibit differences between males and females in risk, progression, symptoms,
and response to therapy; rigorous investigation is needed to define the molecular reasons for
these differences. Our previous work has demonstrated that modeling Omics data using gene
regulatory networks can discover key differences driving health and disease. The goal of this K24
is to merge our prior approach to modeling sex differences with mentoring researchers in sex-
and gender-aware data science. Methods will support modelling gender and sex as a
biologic variable using a data science framework, to promote translation of data from the
NHLBI Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine(TOPMed) program to actionable clinical
innovations for COPD. The goal of this Patient Oriented Research program is to mentor trainees
in Omics data science and Network Medicine through a sex and gender lens, which requires not
only considering biology(sex) but societal constructs(gender); to date this approach has been
limited for lung diseases. To advance the dissemination of data analytic approaches for COPD
research, we will focus on sex and gender aware epidemiology, Omic analyses inclusive of X and
Y chromosome data, and gene regulatory network methods. In addition to mentoring and career
development, trainees will pursue the hypothesis that somatic mosaicism on the X chromosome
(mCA X) and loss of Y (LoY) will associate with COPD phenotypes and COPD progression. To
facilitate mentoring, scientific Aims include 1) Investigating whether mCA X and LoY mediate sex
and gender divergent features of COPD and 2) Defining pathway and gene regulatory network
rewiring associated with mCA X and LoY, using single Omic and network-based approaches.
Innovative aspects include the evaluation of gender as well as sex associations with COPD;
investigation of mCA X and LoY and COPD; extension of gene regulatory network approaches to
include somatic mosaicism; and development of a sex- and gender-aware data science toolkit.
Understanding sex and gender differences using tools to integrate Omics and the gene regulatory
landscapes with mCA X and LoY will improve our understanding of COPD and support precision
medicine initiatives. This paradigm shifting K24 will support the training of the next generation of
pulmonary data scientists interested in sex and gender-aware Patient Oriented Research, with
specific application to COPD, a leading cause of death with sex divergent features.

The cytokines IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 are thought to be key effectors of airway inflammation, but remarkably
little is known about either their global function within the respiratory tract or the potential consequences of
their complete inhibition by newly available biologic drugs. The overall goal of the proposed research is to
define the underlying human biology of IL-4Rα and IL-5R signaling in airway inflammation, both their role in
driving type 2 inflammation and their role in counterregulating other systemic immune pathways. We will
determine the cell-specific impacts of these cytokines within the respiratory tract and confirm the influence
of IL-4Rα and IL-5R on the chronic inflammation of patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis
(CRSwNP), severe asthma, and aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD). Further, given that some
drugs now available to inhibit these pathways have poorly understood side effects like new-onset joint pain,
we will establish the systemic immunologic consequences of inhibiting a receptor as widely expressed as
IL-4Rα and will identify novel biomarkers to predict those immune responses. In three separate but
interrelated projects, we aim to:
 1. Define the cellular mechanism(s) of anti-IL-4Rα-induced therapeutic benefit in AERD with a
 prospective study of 8 weeks of dupilumab treatment.
 2. Define the systemic immunologic consequences of IL-4Rα inhibition with dupilumab and determine
 which immunologic changes correlate with the development of arthralgias.
 3. Characterize the functional significance of IL-5Rα on upper airway nasal plasma cells and epithelial
 cells, from patients with healthy sinus mucosa, CRSwNP, and AERD.
These goals will be achieved using patient-oriented research (POR), as each of these aims involve patient
interactions and longitudinal study visits to collect and verify clinical outcomes, and through the mentorship
of the next generation of patient-oriented allergic disease investigators. The proposed studies and the
clinical questions to be examined offer outstanding training opportunities for junior investigators interested in
clinically relevant research in allergy and asthma. Dr. Tanya Laidlaw is a recognized investigator in the
causes of CRSwNP and AERD and the candidate's many ongoing POR projects and collaborations,
commitment to and track record of mentorship, along with the exceptional institutional resources, provide a
first-rate environment for the development of junior investigators. Critically, this award will provide Dr.
Laidlaw protected time for POR in airway inflammation and allergic respiratory disease to both refine her
mentoring and leadership skills and expand her expertise to include predictive biomarker identification,
pathway-level multi-omics analysis, and high dimensional data analyses.

 This K23 application supports Dr. Sheila Hegde, a highly promising cardiac imager and early-stage
investigator who is committed to investigating the underlying mechanisms by which physical activity (PA)
favorably impacts the risk of heart failure (HF) in late-life. Her long-term goal is to be an independent
investigator studying modifiable biomarkers of aging and HF risk that will ultimately inform therapeutic
intervention. The overall scientific objective of this proposal is to identify biologic pathways underlying the
beneficial effects of PA on cardiac function, functional capacity, and HF risk using high dimensional ‘-omic’
data. The main hypothesis is that PA delays age-related changes in cardiac structure and function and
mitigates HF risk through biologic pathways that can be identified through high throughput circulating
proteomic profiling. The specific aims are to: 1) Employ high-throughput plasma proteomics and genomic data
to identify novel molecular pathways underlying longitudinal PA-related changes in cardiovascular structure
and function and incident HF (NHLBI ARIC cohort); and 2) Identify molecular pathways underlying the
beneficial effect of a structured PA intervention on functional capacity with the use of plasma proteomics in
older sedentary adults at high risk of HF. (Brigham and Women’s Hospital-based cohort). These aims will also
serve as a vehicle to achieve the following career and learning objectives: 1) Attain advanced skills in novel,
data science driven methods for high-dimensional data, particularly in proteomics analysis; and 2) Develop the
necessary skills to design, implement, and conduct a clinical trial in order to transition to an independent
clinical investigator. These objectives will be accomplished through: 1) structured interactions with a
committed and expert multidisciplinary panel of mentors and advisors; 2) focused didactic coursework in study
design and statistical approaches relevant to ‘-omic’ data; and 3) progressive participation in multi-institutional
working groups and committees for national multicenter studies, dedicated mini-courses and meetings relevant
to PA and multi ‘-omic’ analyses, and national cardiovascular professional organizations. These activities will
also act as a framework to grow her leadership skills and to develop external collaborations.
 The results of the proposed early career development award will provide further insight into the
underlying cardiovascular mechanisms by which physical activity impacts age-related changes in cardiac
structure and function, functional capacity, and heart failure (HF) risk and serve as the necessary foundation
for Dr. Hegde to transition to an independent investigator.

This NIH K23 proposal details a comprehensive five-year training plan for mentored patient-oriented research
career development and research to address a major problem in neuromuscular medicine. Over half of patients
with clinically suspected Mendelian myopathies do not have a molecular diagnosis, largely due to two challenges:
detecting pathogenic non-coding variants, and resolving the pathogenicity of ultra-rare missense variants. Here
I propose to address this challenge through the application of genome sequencing (Aim 1), transcriptome
sequencing (Aim 2), and proteomic (Aim 3) methods to evaluate the strengths and weakness of each method
and to improve the diagnostic yield from a cohort of approximately 200 individuals with unsolved Mendelian
myopathies. I hypothesize that since the genetic architecture of Mendelian myopathies implicates large genes
that genome sequencing combined with RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) and proteomics can mitigate the current
low diagnostic yield after clinical evaluation of Mendelian myopathies. Through these approaches, I will define
best practices in applying technologies in the diagnostic evaluation, discover novel disease variants and genes,
and expand our understanding of the genetic architecture of these heterogeneous disorders.
Gaining the analytical skills to evaluate the real-world application of multiomic methods will complement both my
prior expertise in gene discovery for neurologic disorders and my clinical training in neuromuscular medicine. I
am uniquely positioned within the collaborative environment between Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Boston
Children’s Hospital, Broad Institute, and Harvard Medical School to facilitate my transition to an independent
physician-scientist with a long-term translational research goal of developing a center of excellence in the clinical
characterization, molecular diagnosis, and evaluation of targeted gene therapy candidates for patients with
Mendelian myopathies.

This NIH K08 Career Development Award proposal describes a five-year training program studying the role of
NLRP3 inflammasome in Tet2-/- clonal hematopoiesis. The widespread presence of blood cells harboring
somatic genetic alterations in the absence of any hematologic malignancy defines the condition known as
clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP). Both human and mouse studies have demonstrated
significant associations between CHIP and cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
chronic liver disease, osteoporosis, and gout. Focused studies on the genes most frequently mutated in CHIP,
epigenetic regulators TET2 and DNMT3A, have implicated increased chemokine expression and
inflammasome hyperactivation in myeloid cells as a possible mechanistic connection between CH and these
diseases. Dysregulated innate immune and inflammatory signaling also contribute to preleukemic states and
pathogenesis of myeloid disease, but precise mechanisms remain unclear. I propose in Aim 1 to study the role
of NLRP3 inflammasome, a key regulator of inflammation and innate immunity, in mediating Tet2-/- clonal
hematopoiesis. I will characterize the functional role of NLRP3 using an orthogonal approach of clonal
hematopoiesis mouse models, human xenografts and patient specimens. In Aim 2, I propose to characterize
the function of NLRP3 inflammasome at the transcriptional and chromatin levels using single cell sequencing
technology. I will further define the hematopoietic progenitor compartment responsible for Tet2-deficient,
NLRP3-dependent clonal expansion. This work will implicate NLRP3 inflammasome activity in the development
of clonal hematopoiesis and suggest new strategies to target the inflammatory drive in CHIP. The applicant,
Dr. Waihay Wong, has completed clinical training in Anatomic Pathology and Hematopathology at Brigham and
Women’s Hospital (BWH) and Harvard Medical School (HMS). He will complete a research program focused
on training as an independent investigator to study the role of NLRP3 inflammasome in mediating Tet2-/- clonal
hematopoiesis. Dr. Wong proposes to develop expertise in next-generation sequencing, computational
analysis, and mouse models of disease. The mentor, Dr. Benjamin Ebert (HHMI Investigator, Professor of
Medicine at HMS and Chair of Medical Oncology at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, DFCI), is a renowned expert
in the biology of hematopoietic cells and clonal hematopoiesis. Dr. Ebert has successfully mentored numerous
physician-scientists to become independent academic investigators. This mentoring will be supported by
formal course work, seminars, presentations at international meetings, and regular meetings with Dr. Wong’s
Advisory Committee which has complementary expertise and experience in mentoring physician-scientists to
develop independent research programs. Dr. Wong will conduct this research at the DFCI and leverage the
exceptional research and teaching environment at the DFCI, Harvard, and the Broad Institute to complete this
work and realize his long-term career goal of becoming an independent physician-scientist.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Summary: While ABO(H) blood group antigens were the first human polymorphisms described and
corresponding anti-ABO(H) antibodies continue to be the most common immunological barrier to transfusion and
transplantation, the factors responsible for anti-ABO(H) antibody development remain relatively unknown. In
order to overcome barriers that result from anti-ABO(H) antibody formation, key processes that drive anti-ABO(H)
antibody development need to be defined. Our long-term goal is to define the factors that regulate naturally
occurring anti-ABO(H) antibody formation. Our central hypothesis is that exposure to microbes that decorate
themselves with ABO(H) blood group-like antigens drives innate-like B1 B cells to produce naturally occurring
anti-ABO(H) antibodies. Our hypothesis is formulated on the basis of our recent discovery that microbes that
decorate themselves with carbohydrate structures that mimic blood group antigens stimulate the formation of
anti-blood group antibodies capable of causing hemolytic transfusion reactions (HTRs). Our data demonstrate
that anti-ABO(H) antibodies isolated from patients display unique specificity for distinct types of ABO(H) antigens
and when examined against microbial glycans isolated and presented on a microbial glycan microarray, engage
unique microbial determinants, strongly suggesting that microbial glycans may shape an individual's anti-ABO(H)
antibody response. However, as ABO(H) blood group antigens are carbohydrate structures largely confined to
humans, preclinical models capable of formally testing this have not been available. To overcome this limitation,
we developed a preclinical model that recapitulates key features of naturally occurring anti-blood group antibody
formation. Knocking out the enzyme required for the synthesis of the murine blood group B-like antigen (murine
B or Bm), we generated blood group O-like (murine O or Om) mice that spontaneously develop varying levels of
anti-Bm antibodies capable of causing Bm RBC HTRs following transfusion. Sorting and culturing anti-Bm reactive
microbiota identified a strain of Klebsiella pneumonia that specifically expresses the Bm antigen, providing a
possible link between the microbiota and anti-Bm antibody development. As blood group Om mice and O
individuals possess innate-like B1 B cells with blood group specificity, these collective data suggest that microbial
stimulation of B1 B cells drives the formation of anti-blood group antibodies capable of causing HTRs. To test
this hypothesis, we will pursue the following specific aims: Aim 1. Define the role of B1 B cells and anti-blood
group antibody reactive microbiota in the development of anti-ABO(H) antibodies capable of causing
HTRs. Aim 2. Define the requirement for B1 B cells in microbiota-induced anti-Bm antibody formation
using a preclinical model. These aims will not only define the impact of the microbiota on the development of
anti-blood group antibodies, but provide a rich training opportunity for me to weld my previous training in
transfusion immunology with new training in glycobiology to define the governing factors that regulate the
development of the most common immunological barrier in not only transfusion, but also transplantation.

Skull base and face imaging accounts for nearly 20% of clinical neuroradiology examinations. But clinical MRI
of the skull base and face continues to rely primarily on conventional 2D T1-weighted and T2-weighted pulse
sequences and fat suppression techniques. These techniques generate suboptimal tissue contrasts with
suboptimal spatial resolution. The long acquisition times often lead to motion artifact. Contrast weightings and
rapid acquisitions tailored to the uniquely small structures of the skull base and face would expand the clinical
utility of MRI for diagnosing pathologies of these regions. Dr. Guenette’s goal for this four-year K08 mentored
career development award is to gain the skills needed to develop comprehensive skull base- and face-specific
MRI sequences and protocols that optimize clinically relevant contrast-to-noise and simultaneously acquire
relaxometry biomarkers that are co-registered to the anatomic images at the voxel level with markedly reduced
scan times compared with current standard-of-care skull base and face MR imaging. Dr. Guenette is a
neuroradiologist with skull base and face sub-specialization at Brigham and Women’s Hospital. His research
has included optimizing product pulse sequences for imaging skull base and face structures. The training
objectives and research activities of this proposal will provide Dr. Guenette with the mentorship, time, and
resources to learn and apply MRI physics, pulse sequence design, and image processing. The main research
expertise of Dr. Guenette’s mentor, Dr. Bruno Madore, an MRI physicist, lies in the development of novel
acquisition and image reconstruction strategies for MRI. The co-mentor, Dr. Ravi Uppaluri, is an
otolaryngology-head/neck surgeon physician-scientist with complementary clinical expertise. In Aim 1 Dr.
Guenette will: build a normative atlas of quantitative T2, T1, and relative proton density values of anatomic
structures in the skull base and face; use this atlas to generate and test theoretically optimal contrasts for
nerve imaging; establish normative T2, T1, and relative proton density values of head and neck squamous cell
carcinoma (HNSCC) tumors to generate and test optimal contrasts for visualizing and segmenting HNSCC
tumors; and test the biomarker potential of T2, T1, and relative proton density measures in HNSCC. In Aim 2
he will: develop a novel pulse sequence that incorporates scanner gradient strength as a parameter to further
decrease scan times and evaluate synthetic pulse sequences across 1.5T, 3T, and 7T field strengths. The
training and data will facilitate Dr. Guenette’s long-term goal to independently lead an NIH-funded laboratory
focused on developing and implementing more rapid qualitative MR anatomic imaging and quantitative MR
methods specifically tailored to the skull base, face, and neck structures and pathologies.

Fibroblasts are key aggressors in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) where they mediate cartilage and bone destruction,
yet treatments that directly target these cells are lacking. Recent studies from our group and others have
shown that the expansion of an inflammatory subset of fibroblasts are critical to perpetuating the chronic
inflammation in RA, but mechanisms responsible for their inflammatory potentiation are not well-defined. Our
preliminary studies have revealed that synovial fibroblasts are uniquely poised to signal through the Wnt
pathway and further demonstrate that Wnt induces a strong inflammatory response in these cells. Notably,
there is a striking transcriptional gradient demarcated by a Wnt enhancer, R-spondin 3 (RSPO3), and a
putative Wnt inhibitor, Dickkopf-related protein 3 (DKK3), that correlates with Wnt pathway enrichment. We find
that synovial fibroblasts derived from active RA patients show enrichment of gene signatures associated with
Wnt activation and Rspo3 expression, suggesting relevance to arthritis manifestation. We hypothesize that Wnt
signaling through this gradient is critical for mediating inflammatory fibroblast pathogenicity and that Wnt
inhibition can ameliorate joint damage in RA. We develop our hypothesis in three independent aims. In Aim 1,
we define the role of Rspo3 and Dkk3 in regulating Wnt-induced synovial fibroblast activation in vitro using
ligand stimulation and knockdown techniques. In Aim 2, we assess Rspo3 and Dkk3 regulation of Wnt
signaling in synovial fibroblasts of distinct RA patient clinical and histologic phenotypes. Finally, in Aim 3, we
evaluate the clinical utility of targeting stromal Wnt signaling therapeutically in mouse models of inflammatory
arthritis. We anticipate that the significance of these studies will be to elucidate a molecular mechanism
contributing to fibroblast pathogenicity in RA and to address the unmet need for fibroblast-specific therapeutics.
These studies will provide training in immunology, bioinformatics, and murine models of inflammatory arthritis
that that will build a foundation for the PI to develop an independent lab studying the role of stromal cells in
autoimmune disease.

 Over 200 million people are infected with malaria every year. An effective and long-lasting vaccine will
be essential for the elimination and eradication of malaria in Sub-Sharan Africa and worldwide. Though WHO-
approved circumsporozoite protein (CSP) protein vaccine RTS,S is the only vaccine in current use, it provides
<50% protection that is also short lived. The proposed research will delve into the humoral immunity of the
whole sporozoite vaccine (PfSPZ), a model system to identify protective immune responses beyond the
immunodominant epitope CSP - essential insights needed to create new, highly effective malaria vaccines.
 This proposal describes a five-year career development plan to study humoral immunity to the malaria-
causing pathogen Plasmodium falciparum. Though antibodies are important for PfSPZ-mediated protection,
the protective antibody targets and functions remains unknown. Further, PfSPZ's efficacy drops in malaria-
exposed individuals and how pre-existing anti-malarial antibodies affect PfSPZ vaccination remains
unanswered. Our preliminary systems serology analysis of malaria naïve PfSPZ vaccinees has suggested a
new protective role for IgM antibodies to SSP2/TRAP, a malaria host cell recognition and invasion protein, and
validated our approach. The studies proposed here are to 1) define the functional antibody correlates of
protection in malaria-exposed individuals and the effect of pre-existing immunity 2) identify new correlates of
protection with a whole-proteome approach, and 3) define mechanisms of anti-sporozoite immunity of
SSP2/TRAP IgM antibodies. These aims will be carried out with human serum from PfSPZ vaccination and
controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) challenge trials in malaria-naïve and exposed individuals.
 The candidate is currently an Associate Physician at Brigham and Women's Hospital, Instructor in
Medicine at Harvard Medical School (HMS), and Research Fellow at the Ragon Institute with an ongoing
commitment of 80% time to research. The proposal is supported by an expert mentor in humoral immunology,
HMS Professor Facundo Batista, and co-Mentored by expert in systems biology MIT Professor Douglas
Lauffenburger. The candidate is supported by a SAC containing an expert in phage display serological assays,
HMS Professor Stephen Elledge, an expert in malaria vaccinology, NIAID Chief of Cellular Immunology Dr. Robert
Seder, and expert in malaria host-pathogen interactions and pre-erythrocytic immunity University of Washington
Associate Professor Noah Sather. Building on the candidate's doctoral training in malaria pathogenesis and
genomics, this proposal will further his training in humoral immunology, systems biology, and bioinformatics as well
as research scientist-focused professional development and responsible conduct of research coursework.
Completion of this comprehensive training plan will enable the candidate to create a successful and unique research
program, obtain independent funding, and transition to running an independent laboratory focused on malaria
antibody immunology, phage display serologic assay tool development, and vaccinology.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Autism spectrum and related neurodevelopmental disorders are thought to arise from widespread mild synaptic
dysfunction that leads to an altered trajectory of brain network development (Johnson et al., 2015). In Rett
syndrome (RTT), a debilitating neurodevelopmental disorder, loss-of-function mutations in MECP2 on the X
chromosome lead to a devastating loss of language, motor and visual function at the behavioral level. Yet no
therapy exists to stop or reverse the cognitive decline. Previous work in RTT mouse models reveal synaptic- and
network-level defects that precede symptom onset. Mecp2-deficiency alters the timing of excitatory synaptic
maturation in excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the developing cortex (Mierau et al, 2016). Microelectrode
array (MEA) recordings and calcium imaging of neuronal activity in cultured murine cortical neurons reveal delays
in the development of functional connectivity in the Mecp2-deficient cortical networks including smaller network
size, weaker strength of connectivity and impairments in the development of network topology including features
that predict local and global efficiency of the networks (Dunn et al, unpublished). These findings reveal cellular-
scale deficits in information processing that likely underlie the cognitive impairment in RTT and could be targeted
with novel therapies to rescue cognitive function. In my proposed K02 and subsequent R01 research, we will
translate this approach to a human in vitro cellular model of RTT. In Aim 1, air-liquid interface cortical organoids
(ALI-COs) will be generated from RTT patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and allogenic
controls to first identify network-level defects in the development of cortical networks. The ALI-CO model shows
further cortical maturation than previous organoid models and avoids the necrotic core (Giandomenico et al.,
2019). In Aim 2, we will target excitatory synaptic maturation in a specific type of inhibitory neuron in the MeCP2-
deficient ALI-COs using novel cell-type specific modulators we identified (Mierau et al, unpublished). Our goal
is to prevent early synaptic defects and ensure the formation of network activity and topology necessary to
support cellular-scale information processing. This strategy could be used in our future R01 research to prevent
the cognitive decline in RTT. In Aim 3, we will develop novel tools for detecting and modulating network dynamics
in the MeCP2-deficient ALI-COs as a platform for testing strategies to rescue network function in RTT after the
cognitive decline has occurred. Re-expressing Mecp2 in adult Mecp2-deficient mice rescues many behavioral
and synaptic features, raising the hope that neuronal function can be rescued in RTT even after the cognitive
decline. We will next test dynamic electric, optogenetic, and pharmacologic approaches for modulating cognitive
function. This will support the subsequent R01 aims in Year 4 and 5 of the K02 award to test whether modulating
network function in real-time can rescue network function in RTT ALI-COs. This strategy would facilitate
screening of novel therapies to unlock function in symptomatic RTT patients and could be applied in the future
to develop new therapies for autism spectrum and other cognitive disorders.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
While opioid drugs are very effective for controlling pain, they are highly addictive. The current clinical decision
making for post-surgical opioid prescribing is still based on oversimplified information. Both opioid use disorder
and opioid-related pain response have strong genetic underpinnings. A better system is needed to guide the
clinical use of genotype data and facilitate better-informed opioid prescribing decision-making.
Electronic health record (EHR) offer a largely untapped source of information to conduct clinically oriented
studies. By integrating genomic data and EHR dataset in large-scale clinical Biobank, we can now perform
"clinical-driven genomic research". This approach is particularly robust for complex diseases with a genetic
susceptibility.
I propose to develop a model to recommend optimal opioid dosage (oral morphine milligram equivalents) for
post-surgical pain relief and predict the risk of post-discharge harmful outcomes. The large-scale clinical and
genomic databases from the Mass General Brigham (MGB) healthcare system, including eight hospitals that
share a centralized database, will be utilized for model development. The proposed research will not only have
strong immediate potential to improve clinical practice in this urgent area but will also provide strong
preliminary work to support my first NIH R01 application.
From the previous projects, I have developed opioid use disorder clinical phenotypes and identified associated
genetic markers. I have also developed machine learning models to predict risks of complex diseases and
explored clinical application potentials. The proposed project will combine my existing analytical skills with the
newer expertise that I seek to develop through this award program, including a nuanced understanding of
analgesic strategies, addiction, and implementation of clinical decision support systems, as well as artificial
intelligence applications in healthcare system.
I have invited several established investigators to form a strong, multi-disciplinary mentorship team. They
include experts in the fields of addiction, pain management, genetic analysis, implementation methods and
artificial intelligence techniques. With their support, I intend to dedicate my longer-term research career to
study functional genomics in the fields of opioid addiction and pain by using integrated analysis of harmonized
big data. The K01 program outlined in this application will provide timely and strategic support for my continued
advancement towards those goals.

The Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD) is a ubiquitous resource for basic research and clinical
interpretation. The world’s largest genetic variation resource, the gnomAD dataset is used in virtually all clinical
genetic diagnostic pipelines worldwide, and the website has over 20 million page views to date. Here we
outline a proposal that will expand the gnomAD resource to millions of samples across diverse global
populations. Our proposal will scale variant-calling and quality control to match this sample size, integrate
statistical tools and other genomic resources critical to clinical interpretation, and ensure that the data we
aggregate will continue to be shared freely with the biomedical community. To accomplish this we will apply a
highly computationally efficient strategy to call all classes of variation (including SNVs, small indels, and the
mutational spectrum of structural variants) across millions of sequenced samples enriched for under-
represented ancestry groups. We will deploy a cloud-based framework for the efficient storage and automated
quality control of these very large and heterogeneous sequence data sets using the massively parallel Hail
architecture. We will leverage the scale of gnomAD to provide increasingly high-resolution maps of the
depletion of functional variation across regions of the genome (highlighting genome regions where natural
selection constrains DNA change) and provide statistical frameworks for quantitatively assessing whether the
population frequency of a variant is consistent with pathogenicity, linking this information with evidence from
the ClinVar resource. We will continue to share all of this data as rapidly and openly as possible with the
biomedical community, long before publication. We will support and expand functionality in our widely
accessed data browser as well as create scalable and publicly accessible datasets that integrate our variation
data with clinical and functional genomic annotations, accessible through API frameworks to empower novel
applications of the datasets. We will also provide resources and training to improve the use of gnomAD
resources by the clinical genetics and wider biomedical communities.

 The decreasing cost of genomic sequencing will yield millions of samples in the coming years from both
research and healthcare. Sharing this data is necessary to understand human diseases and eventually help
patients, but doing so requires the community to agree on common methods for collecting, storing, transferring,
accessing, and analyzing data. This proposal will support the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health
(GA4GH; www.ga4gh.org) to aid genomic research and human health by developing standards and policies for
effective and responsible data sharing between institutions and countries around the world.
 To advance responsible sharing of global genomic and health-related data, genomics researchers,
clinicians, bioinformaticians, software engineers, and industry experts will work together as a single GA4GH
community to deliver genomic data sharing standards and frameworks (e.g., ontologies, guidelines, technical
schemas). Building on our five years of experience convening stakeholders and developing work products, we
will engage the genomics and health community in the very earliest stages of development to ensure our work
is useful and ready for adoption.
 We will leverage the combined effort of several hundred active contributors to advance development
activities beyond the capacity of our small staff team. These contributors will work within eight GA4GH Work
Streams, each focused on developing critical standards and frameworks, including cloud-based data
federation, scalable schemas and interfaces, data models, and file formats. We will engage deeply within the
broader healthcare, research, and commercial sectors, including the launch of the Genomics in Health
Implementation Forum to drive uptake in the clinical domain.
 A federated ecosystem for searching, discovering, exchanging, and analyzing genomic and clinical data
will enable a global learning health system that advances both research and clinical care beyond their
individual capacities and depends on standards and interoperable frameworks embraced by the entire
community. We envision a future in which the full suite of GA4GH standards enables all clinicians, geneticists,
and researchers to search across the world’s collective genomic data to reveal unanticipated gene-disease
associations, make otherwise impossible drug-response predictions, and generally participate in genomics at a
competitive pace—regardless of their means or location. The promise of genomic medicine lies at a
crossroads that depends on harmonization across the community and will significantly enhance the human
experience if we succeed. We believe that GA4GH is necessary to that success.

Many steps in drug discovery, as well as in basic biological research, could be accelerated with methods that
measure multiple phenotypes simultaneously, known as profiling technologies. When a cell or organism’s
function is affected by disease, a chemical compound, or a genetic perturbation, simultaneously measuring
many phenotypes provides greater power and less bias in identifying their impact. But many existing assays
require many painstaking months to develop and measure only one specific phenotype, missing potentially
crucial information - for example, a chemical might have positive effects on a disease-related assay but its
effects on other pathways are unmeasured, leading to undetected toxicity that is only discovered later.
Research in this MIRA period will focus on advancing algorithms and applications for image-based profiling, a
surprisingly quantitative type of profiling that is the least expensive and among the highest in information
content. Image-based profiling captures the location and amount of each stained cellular component, as well as
changes in morphology, but its applications are underexplored and its algorithms underdeveloped. Having
invented the main assay and software in the field, we aim to bring the technique to maturity now that four
things have become available or possible: (a) Image Data - huge quantities of suitable systematic, structured,
high-throughput, single-cell image data, usually from the Cell Painting assay, via several public-private
partnerships and totaling more than 3 billion single cells across more than 100,000 genetic and chemical
perturbations; (b) Algorithms - novel deep learning algorithms for several steps in profiling: segmentation,
feature extraction, and learning predictive models; (c) Integration - other data sources now available at a
scale that can be fruitfully combined with images; (d) Applications - out of more than a dozen theoretical
applications, many have not been attempted or scaled up for basic biological research and drug discovery, such
as determining compounds’ mechanism of action, identifying their targets, discovering relationships with
genes, predicting toxicity or other assay activity, and identifying gene function.
To fulfill the promise and real-world efficacy of image-based profiling, we therefore aim to leverage recently
available data and algorithms to carry out diverse biological applications, including identifying gene- and
compound-associated phenotypes and functions, virtual screening to identify potential compounds that target
genes of interest, hypothesizing the mechanism of action/targets for small molecules, computationally
predicting assay activity and toxicity, and identifying screenable disease-associated phenotypes. In doing so, we
aim to make rapid progress in algorithms, including trained neural networks/deep learning models, multi-
modal integration, visualization/interpretation, batch correction, and single-cell methods.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
Prion disease is a uniquely rapid, universally fatal progressive neurodegenerative disease of humans and other
mammals. It arises from a single protein, the native prion protein (PrP), which is capable of post-translationally
misfolding into a self-templating and deadly “prion.” Genetic and pharmacological proofs of concept
increasingly identify PrP dosage as the key to understanding, and ultimately intercepting this pathogenic
cascade. In mice with genetically altered PrP levels, lower PrP levels lead to longer survival following prion
infection, while excess PrP hastens disease. PrP-lowering antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) now show
promise as a potential therapeutic strategy. However, effective implementation will hinge on a deeper
understanding of how PrP level controls the rates of prion nucleation, replication and neurotoxicity, and how
this control translates across disease timepoints, species and strains. Though almost all human prion disease
originates in the brain, PrP-lowering interventions have not yet been tested in spontaneous, rather than
inoculated, prion models. Meanwhile, the magnitude of protection conveyed by 50% genetic PrP reduction can
vary between model systems; the relative contributions of slowed prion replication and slowed neurotoxicity to
observed survival benefit in different species and prion strains remain to be disentangled. Finally, PrP lowering
must be studied in the context of patient-derived human prions, to assess how above learnings extrapolate to
strains of public health interest. We will fill these gaps by assessing the following. 1) Kinetics of spontaneous
prion formation. Using a new mouse model of spontaneous prion disease, we will track the spontaneously
disease process through serial molecular measurements of neuronal damage and prion seeding activity.
Through PrP-lowering tool compounds administered at different timepoints, we will disentangle how PrP
dosage modulates prion formation, amplification, neurotoxicity and symptomatic progression. 2) Rapid and
slow prion subtypes as a function of PrP dosage. Using newly engineered PrP knockout hamster and rat
models, we will characterize the kinetics of pathological biomarker rise relative to disease onset and terminal
illness as a function of PrP expression level in both canonically rapid (hamster) and more slowly progressive
(rat) prion disease systems. 3) Impact of PrP lowering on human prions. Using a series of novel
“humanized” mouse lines expressing human PrP at six different dosage levels, that have been shown
susceptible to multiple clinically relevant human prion strains, we will characterize time to pathology, symptom
onset, and terminal illness. PrP level will be varied on a lifelong basis through genetically manipulation, as well
as through postnatal, precisely timed intervention with PrP-lowering tool compounds. Taken together, these
studies will illuminate PrP’s control of disease kinetics across a spectrum of prion disease paradigms, while
building a scientific foundation to guide future development of PrP-lowering therapeutics.

The past decade has seen outstanding advances in the genetics of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Most of
this progress has occurred by the study of rare genetic variation, especially de novo variation, with the Autism
Sequencing Consortium (ASC) playing a central role. The ASC represents a coordinated international effort to
identify ASD risk genes. In our most recent, unpublished, analyses of 72,410 individuals from ASD families, we
identified 185 genes associated with risk (FDR < 0.05). Some of these genes have been linked to a broad array
of developmental disorders, while others have not. Based on these results, we posit that some risk genes alter
the core features of ASD, while creating fewer perturbations to other features of development: discovery of such
genes will provide deeper insights into pathways disrupted in ASD. We will build on this progress by analysis of
sequence data from three resources: ASD subjects and families; subjects with other developmental and neuro-
psychiatric disorders; and subjects from population samples. We plan new research focusing on interpretation
of rare variation, including single nucleotide variation (SNV), indels, and copy number variation (CNV). Our key
targets are inherited variants, including X-linked inherited variants, which to date have shown very little signal,
and missense variants, for which signal has been confined to highly conserved substitutions. We anticipate
doubling the number of ASD genes discovered, ~ 400, by increasing the number of families analyzed and by
refined methods to interpret inherited and missense variation. And, in parallel, we expect to resolve critical as-
pects of ASD genetic architecture and to unveil key aspects of what makes ASD and its core features – social
deficits and restrictive and repetitive behaviors – different from other neurodevelopmental disorders. To discover
ASD risk genes with a distinct effect on ASD, we have the following specific aims: 1) To amalgamate existing
and emerging whole exome and whole genome sequence data; 2) To develop new analytical methods and
analyze the accumulated sequence data; and, 3) To contrast ASD and other neurodevelopmental disorder risk
genes, examining developmental profiles, cell types implicated, and whether variants in the same gene differ in
how they affect risk for ASD and other neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. With this new research
we will accelerate our overall objective, which is the identification of ASD genes, thereby facilitating our long-
term goal of building the foundation from which therapeutic targets for ASD emerge. Our rationale is that the
identification of genes conferring significant risk to ASD and associated neurodevelopmental disorders can form
the basis of studies to understand pathogenesis, as well as the basis for novel therapies. Our central hypothesis
– formulated based on results over the past decade – is that rare and common variation contributes additively to
risk for ASD, but only certain rare variants confer substantial risk. The research proposed is innovative, in our
opinion, because it uses groundbreaking and novel statistical methods for identifying risk variants for ASD.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Cardiometabolic diseases affect millions of people worldwide and have numerous underlying risk factors. Commensal microbes that comprise the intestinal microbiome are implicated in the progression and onset of many of these diseases, including type 2 diabetes, obesity, and atherosclerosis. Gut microbes have extensive metabolic capabilities, allowing them to produce or modify molecules that influence disease risk. Members of the gut microbiota have been known to convert cholesterol into the poorly absorbable metabolite coprostanol for almost 100 years, however the microbial genes responsible for this metabolism were not known. In recent work, we analyzed paired gut metagenomic and metabolomic data to identify a novel group of cholesterol dehydrogenases that metabolize cholesterol when expressed in vitro. Using clinical and metagenomic data from the Framingham Heart Study (FHS), we observed lower serum cholesterol in subjects whose microbiomes encode these cholesterol dehydrogenases. The cholesterol dehydrogenases we originally described convert cholesterol to cholestenone and coprostanone to coprostanol, and we have since identified the intermediate enzyme that converts cholestenone to coprostanone. In this proposal, we will functionally characterize metabolism of sterols in the gut and determine the impact of this process on cardiometabolic disease. In Aim 1, we will identify determinants of host-microbe interactions by collecting and analyzing clinical variables with stool and serum samples from the Gen3/Omni2 FHS cohorts. We will generate coupled stool and serum metabolomics and metagenomics datasets, perform culturomics to assemble a microbial strain library, and identify host exposomes from clinical data. We will then utilize these data to identify and prioritize microbially- derived or modified circulating metabolites associated with CVD for further mechanistic investigations. In Aim 2, We will couple bioinformatics with microbiology and biochemistry for targeted identification of enzymes/proteins that alter sterol structures. This effort will allow us to probe the diversity of gut microbial sterol metabolizing enzymes and their substrates in order to determine specific microbes and genes with the capacity to modify cholesterol. Taking a systems-level approach, we will colonize mice with cholesterol-metabolizing microbial communities to determine how microbial metabolism modulates serum cholesterol and pathways central to cardiovascular disease. In Aim 3, we will functionally link microbiome enzyme activity to sterol metabolism and metabolic disease. We will employ cell-based transcriptional and proteomic assays to interrogate the effects of microbially-modified sterols on local sterol sensing pathways in epithelial cells and measure the effects of circulating sterol metabolites on human immune cells.

CRISPR-Cas9 is an RNA-guided endonucleases that is being actively used for sequence-specific DNA
recognition, genome engineering, targeted transcriptional activation/repression and genome imaging. Cas9 is
being developed as a gene therapy agent for multiple pathologies, including HIV, vision disorders, muscular
dystrophy, and hereditary disorders. The precision control of specificity of CRISPR-Cas9 is required as off-
target effects and chromosomal translocations are observed at elevated activity. Further, the ease of targeting
catalytically impaired Cas9 to any genomic locus has resulted in transformative technologies. For example, the
fusion of catalytically inactive Cas9 (dCas9) to transcriptional activators or repressors has enabled gene
transcription and repression; fusion of catalytically impaired Cas9 to base-modifying enzymes has allowed base
conversion (e.g., C→T) at specific genomic sites; dCas9‒GFP fusion has made imaging genomic loci possible;
and dCas9‒acetyltransferases or deacetylases fusion has enabled epigenome editing. We propose to apply
chemical and genetic approaches develop reagents and methods that will allow precision control of specificity
of CRISPR-Cas9.

 The direct manipulation of genes and gene products in vivo has enormous therapeutic potential, and many
strategies to achieve these goals are swiftly advancing toward clinical use. Proteins that can manipulate DNA,
RNA, and proteins in living cells, including genome editing technologies that enable the precise correction of
disease-causing mutations in vivo, have exemplified the promise of such approaches both for research and
therapeutic applications. While many of these approaches have shown promise in initial research studies,
proteins often require extensive development and tailoring to acquire the activity, specificity, and stability needed
to serve as impactful research tools or leads for therapeutic development. As new macromolecular therapeutic
modalities continue to be developed at a remarkable rate, methods to generate proteins on a rapid time scale
with tailor-made functions are needed. Ideally such methods will be versatile and can be applied to many
classes of problems in the life sciences.
 Our lab developed phage-assisted continuous evolution (PACE), a technology to evolve biomolecules ≥100-
fold faster than using conventional laboratory evolution approaches, with minimal required researcher
intervention. We have demonstrated the ability of PACE to evolve many different classes of proteins with new
and altered activities, specificities, and other desirable properties such as soluble expression in E. coli. Proteins
evolved using PACE have shown broad utility in multiple non-bacterial settings, including genome editing agents
that have been applied to rescue human cell and animal models of genetic diseases, and insecticidal proteins
that kill agricultural pests. These developments establish PACE as a broadly applicable and highly enabling
technology for generating therapeutically and biotechnologically relevant proteins.
 We propose to apply PACE to evolve novel proteins with therapeutic potential, or that enable new
technologies for therapeutics discovery. These proteins include next-generation precision genome editing
agents that can be more easily delivered in vivo or are more efficient and clinically relevant; self-delivering
proteases that cleave endogenous protein targets implicated in neurodegenerative disorders and brain cancer;
and small molecule-binding proteins that enable drug-induced target protein degradation. Success would
provide a foundation for innovative therapeutic strategies to correct mutations that cause human genetic
diseases, and to reprogram self-delivering proteases as catalytic drugs to treat brain diseases. In addition, by
creating drug-sensitive alleles that allow a protein of interest to be degraded in a small molecule-dependent
manner, the proposed research would establish powerful new functional genomics tools to reveal biological
functions and validate therapeutics targets. Collectively, the proposed research integrates powerful protein
evolution technologies with enzymes that precisely manipulate genomes and proteomes to advance
therapeutics science.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：The contemporary clinical successes of immunotherapies have highlighted the key role of tumor-infiltrating cells
in mediating anti-tumor immunity and have generally associated the presence of T cells within tumors with
therapeutic response. However, until now, a systematic approach for evaluating how T cell state, their clonal
identity and localization are related has not been possible. In recent years, the Wu lab has achieved several
notable technical advances, including generation of a best-in-class HLA class I epitope predictor (HLAthena); a
highly robust targeted plate-based method for single-cell TCR sequencing (rhTCRseq); and a means to
parallelize the cloning of hundreds of TCRs such that they can be interrogated to definitively link a TCR with its
antigen specificity. Because dynamic interactions between tumor-reactive T cells and malignant clones occur
within the defined spatial ordering of tissue, our valuable new insights motivate us to investigate how the spatial
organization of tumor-specific T cells relates to in situ positioning of tumor clones. We hypothesize that antigen
specificity, which drives the interactions between T cells and tumor cells, impacts the distinct regional localization
of T cells within the tumor microenvironment at baseline and in the context of therapy; conversely, that knowledge
of spatial localization identifies T cell clones specific for distinct antigen types. Slide-seq technology, created by
the Chen lab, provides a tractable and exciting path to investigate this hypothesis by implementing a scalable
approach to undertake in-depth analyses of informative human and murine tumor tissues. By expanding the
capabilities of this unbiased cellular resolution spatial capture method, we aim to gain tissue level understanding
of how the abundance and functional state of T cell clones and their spatial orientation within the tumor
microenvironment are linked. In particular, the study will address the spatial organization of T cell clones and
tumor subclones in human and mouse tumors. Our technology goals will be to increase the efficiency of
transcript capture of the technology, extend the capability to include robust detection of tumor mutations, and to
develop a suite of analytic tools to integrate in a multi model fashion the transcript, DNA-level and TCR levels of
information (Aims 1-2). Focusing on RCC tumors, we will evaluate the cell-cell localization patterns of T cell
clones in relation to tumor subclones and stromal cells through integrated spatial analyses of TCR and DNA
Slide-seq data (Aim 2). Finally, we will evaluate the impact of antigen specificity (definitively assessed by robust
TCR reconstruction and interrogation methods established in our lab) on T cell phenotype and localization using
TCR and DNA Slide-seq integrated spatial analyses at baseline and following immune checkpoint blockade and
neoantigen vaccine. (Aim 3) Altogether, we will develop and test these tools to understand spatially localized
cellular networks which drive immune response, and T-cell receptor relationships with the tumor
microenvironment. The completion of our work will yield a comprehensive toolset to enable a molecular,
cellular and histological understanding of the tumor immune response.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by b-site APP cleaving enzyme-1 (BACE-1) is the rate-
limiting step in production of Ab, whose deposition is the pathological hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease
(AD). Despite a rapidly growing burden of health care for the aging United States, there is a fundamental
gap in understanding how trafficking and mutations of APP influence neuronal function and contribute to
AD pathogenesis. Continued existence of this gap represents a critical problem because, until it is filled,
AD prevention and treatment based on molecular understanding of the disease progression remains
inaccessible. Since neurons can grow axons that are up to a meter long, continuous imaging of APP
trafficking and processing in live neurons at the single-molecule level requires extremely photostable
fluorophores. Our lab has recently developed a new class of upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) that
are immensely photostable over months. The overall objective of this project is to use our novel
photostable UCNPs to perform single-molecule imaging of the trafficking and processing of APP in live
human induced neurons (iNs) – an excellent model system as many human diseases are not fully
recapitulated in mouse neurons. The central hypothesis is that mutations of APP lead to impaired axonal
transport and render APP more vulnerable for b-cleavage by BACE-1. This hypothesis has been
formulated on the basis of previous work on culture mouse neurons and transgenic mouse models. The
rationale for the proposed research is that ultralong-term single molecule imaging of WT and mutant APP
in human iNs will reveal axonal transport defects caused by AD-associated mutations, providing
important insights into their relationship to AD. Guided by strong preliminary data on the novel
experimental platform, the hypothesis will be tested by pursuing the three specific aims: 1) Measure the
trafficking dynamics of endocytosed APP in human iNs; 2) Determine how axonal transport is impaired
by mutations of APP in human iNs; and 3) Visualize the association dynamics of APP and BACE-1 in
human iNs. A battery of techniques including single-molecule imaging, nanotechnology, biochemistry
and stem cell technology will be used to interrogate APP trafficking. The approach is innovative because
it departs from the status quo by utilizing extremely photostable UCNPs to perform long-term single-
molecule tracking, novel analysis for non-invasive determination of motor number, and the use of human
induced neurons. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to characterize in depth
the trafficking and association dynamics of APP and BACE-1 with unprecedented spatiotemporal
resolution, as well as uncover the extent to which APP mutations impair axonal transport, thereby
shedding light on future prevention and treatment of AD.

 The Center for Open Bioimage Analysis will serve the cell biology community’s growing need for
sophisticated software for light microscopy image analysis. Quantitative image analysis has become an
indispensable tool for biologists using microscopy throughout basic biological and biomedical research.
 Quantifying images is now a critical, widespread need as imaging experiments continue to grow in scale,
size, dimensionality, scope, modality, and complexity. Many biologists are missing out on the quantitative
bioimaging revolution due to lack of effective algorithms and/or usable software for their needs, or lack of
access to training. The Center brings together the Carpenter laboratory at the Broad Institute and the Eliceiri
laboratory at the University of Wisconsin­Madison, and in doing so brings together the two most popular open
source bioimage analysis projects, ImageJ (including ImageJ2 and FIJI) and CellProfiler. Through the
collaborative development and dissemination of open source image analysis software, as well as training
events and resources, the Center will empower thousands of researchers to apply advanced analytics in
innovative ways to address new experimental areas.
 Building on the team’s expertise developing algorithms and user­friendly software for use in biology under
real­world conditions, the Center will focus on two Technology Research and Development (TR&D) projects:
deep learning­based image processing, and accessibility of image­processing algorithms for biologists. This
work will not occur in isolation at the Center; rather, the Center will nucleate a larger community working on
these two areas and serve as a catalyst and organizing force to create software and resources shared by all.
 The Driving Biological Projects (DBPs) will serve a major role in driving the TR&D work: our teams are
accustomed to working deeply and iteratively on problems side by side and with frequent feedback from
biologists. This will ensure that important cell biological problems drive the work of the Center. The DBPs
reflect tremendous variety in terms of biological questions, model systems, imaging modalities, and researcher
expertise and will ensure robustness of our tools for the widest possible impact on the community. Continuing
the teams’ track record with ImageJ and CellProfiler, two mature open source bioimage analysis software
projects critical to the work of biologists worldwide, the Center will also assist and train biologists in applying
the latest computational techniques to important biological problems involving images.
 In short, the need for robust, accurate, and readily usable software is more urgent than ever. The Center for
Open Bioimage Analysis will serve as a hub for pioneering new computational strategies for diverse biological
problems, translating them into user­friendly software, further developing ImageJ and CellProfiler, and training
the biological community to apply advanced software to important and diverse problems in cell biology.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
This proposal outlines a five-year research and career development program aimed at building computational
frameworks for understanding the phenotypic effects of perturbations and somatic alterations in cancer. The
application is heavily based on the candidate’s extensive PhD training in Carnegie Mellon University’s world-
renowned Computer Science Department. It is also grounded in the candidate’s rich prior experience working
as an Associate Computational Biologist at the Broad Institute, and his large network of top-level physicians
and scientists in the cancer field. It also leverages his current postdoctoral appointment under Dr. Gad Getz at
the Broad Institute, and the unique set of resources, facilities, collaborations and expertise in this institute.
Along with a series of relevant didactics and career building activities, these studies will form the basis of his
transition to an independent tenure track position as a scientist guided by the goal of enabling long-term
modeling and understanding of cancer as a disease. The large-scale availability of next-generation sequencing
data for cancer has offered an unprecedented characterization of somatic changes that happen in this disease.
Understanding their combinatorial phenotypic effects is still an open problem, and powerful in vitro perturbation
protocols have been designed to experimentally probe these effects. However, the search space for possible
combinations of perturbations to screen is prohibitively large. The objective of this work is to provide principled
Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven methodology for inferring the effects of perturbations and observed somatic
alterations in cancer, a crucial step in understanding the mechanisms. The proposed work draws on recent
development in the technical fields of machine learning and causal discovery. In particular, two Specific Aims
will be evaluated: (Aim 1) inferring causal graphs from single-cell RNA-seq (with the option of pairing it with
whole-exome/whole-genome sequencing); (Aim 2) using a deep generative model, along with paired whole-
exome/whole-genome sequencing, to learn latent underlying factors of variation in single-cell RNA-seq. The
proposed work also includes steps to validate these computational aims. When completed, this work will
advance the field via algorithms/resources that can be used to: (1) use causal knowledge to computationally
select combinations of targets to test in the lab; and (2) computationally infer the effects of somatic DNA
alterations of interest on expression, leading to improved downstream experiment design. Therefore, put
together, the proposed aims are a crucial step in understanding mechanisms in cancer, and will lead to
significant progress towards efficiently discovering drugs for this disease.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The dissemination of antibiotic resistance and the drying-up of antibiotic discovery pipelines threaten to
increase morbidity from routine medical procedures and worsen the spread of infectious diseases. The main
objective of this project is to address the dual challenges of antibiotic resistance and discovery by (1)
pinpointing the cellular pathways involved in antibiotic-induced bacterial cell death and (2) leveraging these
mechanistic data to discover and develop novel structural classes of antibiotics from chemical libraries of >11
million compounds. The working hypothesis is that antibiotic mechanisms of action (MoAs) manifest through
physical changes to cellular structures, and that approaches to antibiotic discovery which integrate this MoA
information can more reliably discover novel classes of antibiotics than current discovery pipelines. This
hypothesis will be tested in two specific aims: (1) develop novel methods of probing and perturbing antibiotic
lethality at the single-cell level (Years 1 to 4) and (2) develop a computational platform for deep learning
classes of new antibiotics which exploits the mechanisms of action of known antibiotics (Years 2 to 5). During
the first phase of this award, microfluidic, optical, and fluorescence microscopy will be used to record changes
to physical properties of cytoplasmic and cell envelope components in Escherichia coli cells treated with
various bactericidal antibiotics. Additional targeted experiments based on chemical perturbations, physical
perturbations, and genetic overexpression and knockout will inform physical and mathematical models, based
on multiscale continuum mechanics, that classify the phenotypes associated with antibiotic-induced cell death.
During the second phase of this award, a deep learning platform which predicts both antibiotic leads and their
predicted MoAs in silico will be developed. This mechanism-guided approach will be used to identify antibiotic
leads and their MoAs from vast chemical spaces, and leads will be experimentally validated in vitro against
laboratory strains and multidrug-resistant clinical isolates. Leads will be further investigated using human cell
cytotoxicity, hit-to-lead, pharmacokinetic, and in vivo mouse bacterial infection experiments.
A better understanding of antibiotic MoAs and the development of novel drug discovery efforts with detailed
mechanistic underpinnings fit NIH’s public health mission and have direct implications for the prevention and
treatment of infectious diseases. This work will establish a quantitative, model-guided platform for better
characterizing and discovering antibiotics, one which promises to offer a fertile source of mechanistic
information and chemical diversity. By providing the applicant the opportunity to develop his research career,
acquire new wet-lab experimental skills, undertake translational coursework, and receive mentorship from
leading experts in antibiotics, machine learning, biotechnology, and infectious diseases at MIT, the support and
training provided by this award will enable the applicant’s development as an independent researcher.

Understanding of genetic interactions can lead to therapeutic design for individual cancer patients by targeting
the specific genetic vulnerability in the cancer genome. For example, by identifying gene pairs that pose severe
fitness defects when knocked out simultaneously (compared to separate knockouts), one can selectively kill
cancer cells that harbor loss-of-function mutation in one protein by inhibiting its synthetic-lethal partner. Despite
generation of large-scale data delineating the tumor transcriptome, proteome, metabolome, imaging, and so on,
little is known regarding how different genes interact with each other and it is unclear how one can design
targeted treatments based on the ‘omics data available. To address these challenges, the proposed research
will develop a “visible” machine learning framework to systematically understand the higher-order genetic
interactions (i.e. di-genic and tri-genic interactions) in cancer and design targeted treatments.
 The first step for the proposed framework is to gain a holistic view of cancer pathways through combining
the ‘omics data available. Multiple approaches have been applied to integrate data of similar forms, but there yet
lacks an effective solution for integrating data of vastly different qualities and formats. To address this challenge,
Yue Qin has developed a method to infer a hierarchical cancer cell map capturing cancer pathways at multi-
scale resolution by fusing immunofluorescence (IF) imaging data and affinity purification-mass spectrometry (AP-
MS).
 During the F99 phase of the proposed research, by tying the architecture of a deep neural network to the
hierarchical cancer cell map, Yue will develop a “visible” neural network (VNN) that can predict the cancer cell
fitness from genetic perturbation (i.e. knockouts) and genomic backgrounds (i.e. mutations) while providing
mechanistic insights in cancer pathways critical for genotype-phenotype prediction.
 During the K00 phase of the award, Yue will develop genetic engineering approaches to experimentally
map higher-order genetic interactions in cancer cells based on the mechanistic insights obtained from VNN
during genotype-phenotype prediction. The data generated experimentally can directly inspire targeted treatment
designs. In addition, the new data can be integrated into the hierarchical cancer cell map to improve accuracy
and resolution of the inferred pathways, thus further improving the “visibility” of VNN in genotype-phenotype
prediction.
The combination of a computational focused training during F99 phase and experimental focused training
during K00 phase will fully prepare Yue leading her own interdisciplinary research in cancer biology. In addition,
the personalized training plan covering aspects including mentoring and teaching, scientific writing, and oral
presentation will ensure Yue acquiring skills necessary for her future establishment as an independent
investigator.

Copper is an essential co-factor for enzymes across the animal kingdom yet even modest intracellular
concentrations can be toxic, resulting in cell death. The toxicity of copper prompted the development of copper
ionophores such as elesclomol as potential cancer therapeutics. However, lack of clarity regarding their
mechanism of action has prevented their clinical development despite a favorable tolerability profile in clinical
trials. We have recently described that copper ionophores promote a surprising new form of regulated cell death,
distinct from other known and well annotated cell death pathways (such as apoptosis, ferroptosis and
necroptosis). This new form of regulated cell death is copper dependent (hence termed “cuproptosis”) and is
regulated by mitochondrial FDX1 and cellular protein lipoylation, a conserved lysine post-translational
modification regulating only 4 key mitochondrial enzymes. Despite this essential role in enabling cuproptosis,
little is known about the natural function of FDX1 in the cell, and the regulation and manifestation of protein
lipoylation in different cancer types. Establishing a coherent mechanism explaining FDX1 and protein lipoylation
regulation of copper ionophore induced cell death is crucial for any future attempts to repurpose these molecules
as cancer therapeutics. As such, we will combine multidisciplinary approaches that include genomic and
proteomic perturbation strategies with metabolite profiling and multiplexed imaging in cell culture and distinct
mouse tumor models to determine the natural function of the key regulators of cuproptosis (FDX1 and protein
lipoylation) in cancer cell growth and tumor formation, enabling a mechanistic understanding of how they regulate
cuproptosis. Specifically, in Aim 1, we will focus on elucidating the natural function of the key regulator of
cuproptosis, FDX1, in cells. We will take a focused approach to determine if it regulates Fe-S cluster biosynthesis
or protein lipoylation, we will use proteomic approaches to characterize its protein-protein interactions, and we
will perform deep mutational scanning to map the structure-function interactions of FDX1. In Aim 2, we will
specifically focus on the unique regulatory role of lipoylated DLAT in promoting cuproptosis. We will use different
image-based approaches to define the biophysical properties of lip-DLAT aggregates and their protein
composition identifying links to multiple other cellular features. In Aim 3 we will first explore the levels of protein
lipoylation across hundreds of cancer cell lines and establish the cell state associated with high lipoylation cancer
cells. Then, we will determine the manifestation and dependency on FDX1 and protein lipoylation in both classic
xenograft tumor models and in models of metastatic tumors growing in different organs. Lastly, we will use these
in vivo models to establish the efficacy and on-target engagement of copper ionophores in cancer cell models
that are predicted to be highly sensitive to these compounds. Together, this proposal will advance our
understanding of the role of FDX1 and protein lipoylation in cancer and how these key regulators promote
cuproptosis in cells and tumors.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Chemical biology and systems biology operate at different scales of molecular or cellular
organization, requiring translation between the disciplines (e.g., terminology, existing evidence,
new findings) to allow each to inform the other (1, 2). We propose a Biomedical Data Translator
Knowledge Provider for Systems Chemical Biology to address this need.
Centrally, the promise of systems chemical biology (SCB) is discovering novel therapeutics
and re-purposing opportunities, avoiding toxicity and other side effects, and understanding
how small molecules function (i.e., mechanism-of-action studies). Many evidence types used
to solve such problems can also be used to understand functions of alterations at similar
molecular scales, such as post-translational modification and protein-coding genetic variants.
Currently, researchers in the field face major data access and interpretation challenges. For
example, to support mechanism-of-action (MoA) studies, many experimental methods produce
relevant data (gene-expression, protein-protein interactions, diverse bioactivities against pure
proteins and cells, etc.) that are too numerous and heterogeneous to query for most researchers.
Many web-based tools exist to share such data, but they are scattered, not always easy to find,
and generally lack any communication between each other. As the field matures and increasingly
embraces high-throughput experiments, these problems will only get worse (3).
Our proposed SCB Knowledge Provider will mitigate these challenges by:
• integrating and reconciling core molecular data (structure, name, annotated target) from
multiple existing resources;
• integrating and analyzing biological activity data for small molecules across multiple
biological scales (binding, cellular activity, disease indication) (4); and
• providing context for activities of small molecules and their targets informed by systems
biology (complexes, pathways, processes).
Our proposed SCB Knowledge Provider will enable answering questions such as:
• what is the mechanism of action of a small molecule identified from a phenotypic screen?
• which compounds are available to modulate my target of interest, and which other
candidate targets might influence the activity of my target in a particular cellular context?
• given my interest in a disease process or pathway, which candidate targets should I
consider in relevant models, and which compounds are known to modulate those targets?
We anticipate addressing gaps in data by scouting for inclusion additional sources of small-molecule
bioactivity and contextual information about protein target function (see Data
Milestones). We will implement existing and develop new methods to surface inconsistencies
and prioritize returned results (see Methods Milestones). Finally, we propose an Advisory
Committee to help prioritize content most relevant to researchers, overcome development
obstacles, and keep abreast of emerging data and methods (see Outreach Milestones).
We have core expertise needed to realize this SCB vision via 15+ years of experience with
small-molecule bioactivity databases and portals (5-7), plus expertise in phenotypic screening,
small-molecule profiling, and MoA studies (8-10), which demand integrated understanding of
diverse data for hypothesis-driven science. We also made key contributions to Translator
feasibility, including a workflow-centric view of data exploration by subject-matter experts,
identifying and providing key datasets and methods for production of TIDBITS, and prototyping
set-based (e.g., gene-list) analyses in workflows. These experiences ideally position us to
realize a Systems Chemical Biology Knowledge Provider for Translator.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：A major goal of the Biomedical Data Translator Program is to facilitate disease classification
based on molecular and cellular abnormalities. While many experimental approaches exist to
interrogate molecular or cellular processes, few can discern which among a host of potential
abnormalities are relevant to disease in the human system. Genetic variants associated with
disease are unique in providing molecular alterations causally related to human disease risk.
There are two types of genetic associations. Rare disease associations can (usually) be
clearly linked to a gene and are well represented by catalogs such as ClinVar, OMIM, and
Monarch. Complex disease associations are harder to interpret because they (a) are statistical
rather than qualitative and (b) usually lie in noncoding genomic regions that cannot be
immediately translated to molecular or cellular abnormalities. Many complementary resources to
help in the biological translation of complex disease associations have recently emerged,
broadly classifiable as either “functional genomic” datasets (e.g. from epigenomic profiling or
chromatin capture) or predictive bioinformatic methods (e.g. that integrate various genetic and
functional genomic datasets to predict disease-susceptibility genes or pathways). These
resources require expertise to curate and interpret, and there is as yet no knowledge source
that integrates them to interpret complex disease associations. Furthermore, techniques for
harmonizing heterogeneous functional genomic datasets with respect to one another are not yet
established, most predictive bioinformatic methods specify complex data-processing pipelines
that have not yet been scaled to run across many diseases, and there are few if any “gold
standards” to evaluate the molecular or cellular abnormalities identified by these resources.
The goal of our proposed project is to address these gaps within a complex
disease genetics Knowledge Provider for Translator. We are experts in complex disease
genetics and maintain the Knowledge Portal Network (KPN), a collection of open source web
portals and Smart APIs that make integrated genetic and genomic datasets publicly accessible
for >180 complex diseases. We have built the KPN by developing a protocol for working with
disease experts to aggregate and curate high-confidence genetic datasets, building
computational pipelines to harmonize these data and apply predictive bioinformatic methods
upon them, and extracting relationships mined from these data into a Neo4J graph database.
We propose to use the KPN as a foundation to implement a Translator Knowledge Provider of
high-confidence complex disease associations and predicted disease-relevant molecular and
cellular abnormalities. We will implement this Knowledge Provider by (a) expanding the data
sources, data types, and bioinformatic methods integrated within the KPN; (b) developing new
computational algorithms to improve the ability of genetic data to identify molecular and cellular
abnormalities underlying complex disease; (c) maintaining REST services provisioning
Translator with these resources; and (d) developing methodologies for evaluating the accuracy
and internal consistency of these data, further curating them, and defining use cases of them
within Translator. In so doing, we will enable Translator users to address questions such as:
• What genes are causally linked to complex disease [X], and with what confidence?
• What is the increase in risk for complex disease [X] when gene [Y] is perturbed?
• What pathways are enriched for associations with complex disease [X]?
• What tissues mediate the pathogenesis of complex disease [X]?
• What other diseases are genetically correlated with complex disease [X]?
We participated in the Translator feasibility study and contributed important insights to the
project vision including (a) a unifying architectural model of Translator (based on interviews with
each Translator team) closely followed by OTA-19-009; (b) the concept of Translator as a tool to
augment (rather than replace) human reasoning; and (c) the idea of a “Turing test” to evaluate
Translator capabilities. Our expertise in human genetics and hypothesis-driven science, but also
computer science and computational biology, ideally positions us to collaborate with NIH staff
and other awardees to help guide Translator data integration in a scientifically rigorous manner.

Research Plan: Targeted protein degradation using molecular glues - small molecules that bring a protein of
interest in proximity to an E3 ligase - emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy for cancer, especially for
proteins that have been historically challenging to target with conventional drug discovery approaches. However,
the development of molecular glue degraders presents a formidable challenge due to the absence of a
systematic methodology for identifying these compounds. Currently, most molecular glue degraders employed
in the clinic setting have been identified through serendipitous discovery, thereby limiting their potential
applications for targeting intractable oncogenic proteins. To address this challenge, I have developed a novel
chemoproteomic approach, referred to as "Lysate IP", which enables the identification of novel molecular glue
activities in small molecules.
In my preliminary investigation using this method, I discovered that lenalidomide, an FDA-approved molecular
glue degrader, induces ASS1 recruitment to CRBN, but it does not result in ASS1 degradation. Given the
extensive use of lenalidomide in the clinic and in CRBN-based PROTACs, it is crucial to examine all potential
activities that lenalidomide elicits. Therefore, during the mentored K99 phase, I propose to investigate the
implication of ASS1 recruitment to CRBN by lenalidomide, and its role in lenalidomide resistance in multiple
myeloma (Aim 1). In the subsequent independent R00 phase, I intend to utilize the developed Lysate IP assay
for the large-scale, multiplexed identification of novel molecular glues against unexplored E3 ubiquitin ligases
(Aim 2), as part of the anticancer drug discovery process. The primary objective of this research is to
systematically identify and characterize new molecular glues with the ultimate goal of expanding the small
molecule toolbox for targeted cancer therapy.
Career Development Plan: I have created a 5-year career development plan that enables me to attain my goal
of becoming an independent investigator in cancer biology. My extensive background in chemical biology and
medicinal chemistry has positioned me in a unique position to accomplish the goals outlined in this proposal.
Supported by an interdisciplinary team of advisors and collaborators, including Drs. Benjamin Ebert, Eric Fischer,
Scott Armstrong, and Amit Choudhary, I aim to acquire novel proficiencies in a range of areas including large-
scale chemical screenings, mass spectrometry, omics-scale data analysis and visualization, and comprehensive
cancer biology. Additionally, with institutional support from the Broad Institute, as well as through formal
coursework and training, I will establish an independent, cancer-oriented drug discovery program with the goal
of expanding the range of druggable proteins using small molecules.

Chronic Toxoplasma gondii infections are widespread and their reactivation can cause life-threatening disease in
immunocompromised individuals and recurrent ocular lesions in the immunocompetent. The recently identified
master regulator of chronic differentiation, BFD1, provides an unprecedented opportunity to investigate the
molecular events that establish and maintain chronic T. gondii infections. BFD1 is necessary for chronic
differentiation in cell culture and in mouse models of infection, and its expression is sufficient to induce chronic
differentiation. Consistent with a sustained requirement for BFD1 during chronic stage maintenance, the
differentiation program is reversed upon conditional down-regulation of BFD1. Preliminary results indicate that BFD1
is post-transcriptionally controlled through its 5′ UTR, leading to the hypothesis that translational regulation of BFD1
is fundamental to the development and maintenance of chronic T. gondii stages. This proposal seeks to integrate
BFD1 into a broader regulatory network through three complementary aims. Aim 1 will examine the sequence
elements, secondary RNA structures, and ribosomal occupancy dynamics that mediate BFD1 translational
regulation. Aim 2 will use conditional depletion of BFD1 to characterize transcriptional and proteomic changes that
mediate reactivation, and the molecular circuits that maintain the differentiated state. Finally, Aim 3 will extend the
regulatory pathways that control differentiation by screening for genes involved in the translational regulation of BFD1
and further examining the function of transcription factors directly regulated by BFD1. The overarching goal of this
comprehensive analysis is to understand the conditions that promote chronic differentiation and license the
development of curative therapies against toxoplasmosis.

Apicomplexan parasites include the etiologic agents of many widespread infections of humans and livestock,
such as malaria and toxoplasmosis. These diseases are caused by destruction of the host tissues in which the
parasites replicate. Because apicomplexans only replicate inside host cells, the process of invasion is critical to
their survival and pathogenesis. Invasion is mediated by the release of proteins from specialized secretory
organelles at the apical end of the parasite, the micronemes and rhoptries. Microneme proteins include
adhesins that support parasite motility and are therefore secreted as soon as parasites emerge from replication
and start migrating towards new host cells to infect. Rhoptries, by contrast, secrete their contents only upon
host cell recognition once parasites have committed to invasion. Evidence suggests that the release of rhoptry
contents depends on the prior secretion of microneme proteins; however, the molecular events that link these
two processes are unknown. Based on a genome-wide screen in the model apicomplexan Toxoplasma gondii,
our lab recently identified a conserved microneme protein necessary for invasion of human cells, which we
named CLAMP. Our preliminary studies show that CLAMP is necessary for rhoptry secretion and stably
associates with two microneme proteins: SPATR, which was previously implicated in invasion, and an
uncharacterized protein we call CLIP. We hypothesize that these interactions represent a novel invasion
complex necessary for rhoptry protein secretion. Our first aim is to compare the functions of CLAMP,
SPATR, and CLIP; investigate how they oligomerize; and elucidate the relationship between complex
formation and rhoptry secretion. In our second aim, we will identify and characterize host and parasite proteins
that interact with the CLAMP invasion complex. Finally, our third aim will take an unbiased look at the host cell
factors that stimulate rhoptry protein secretion, which may intersect with the CLAMP complex to regulate this
key step in apicomplexan invasion. Based on the conservation of the parasite proteins involved, we expect that
the principles uncovered will be generalizable to the phylum and broadly inform our understanding of these
infectious agents.

High-risk Neuroblastoma (HRNB) is an extracranial pediatric cancer in which up to 65% of patients are
resistant to therapies. Recent biomedical advances have improved treatment options for cancer patients. Yet,
there are no effective treatment for relapsed HRNB patients who have undergone treatment and experienced
tumor recurrence. Our long-term goal is to develop more effective treatments that target relapsed HRNB.
A key feature of HRNB that drives disease progression is aberrant calcium (Ca2+) signaling. This offers
targeted therapeutic potential for Ca2+ channel inhibitors. Other groups have made progress in creating and
identifying Ca2+ channel inhibitors that may be used for cancer treatment. Our group is taking an alternative
approach by targeting Ca2+ signals that promote NB progression that are unique to relapsed HRNB. The
proposed project will leverage the elevated levels of cytosolic Ca2+ in relapsed HRNB driven by enhanced
store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) to promote mitochondrial Ca2+ overload and apoptosis. The hypothesis is
that the activation of autophagy prevents mitochondrial Ca2+ overload and apoptosis in relapsed HRNB that
otherwise might be prone to apoptosis due to the elevated SOCE. Therefore, combination treatment composed
of a novel drug 249 and an autophagy inhibitor will effectively kill relapsed HRNB.
Targeting the mitochondrial Ca2+ transporters to regulate apoptosis may offer a new therapeutic approach for
treating relapsed HRNB and a variety of cancers. A detailed understanding of mtCa2+ signaling will allow
targeting of the diseased tissue without deleterious effects on healthy tissue.
In addition, this work includes undergraduate and graduate student researchers, including those from
underrepresented minority groups. Therefore, this work will train the next generation of researchers and
increase diversity in the biomedical workforce.

Extracellular ATP and ADP are mediators of purinergic signaling in cell-to-cell communication in virtually every
tissue. Autocrine and paracrine purinergic signaling contributes to normal cellular functions such as immune cell
chemotaxis and cell volume regulation, and purinergic signaling also contributes to pathology in injury, infection,
sepsis, and a number of diseases. Notably, extracellular ATP and ADP mediate purinergic signaling between
cells with both short-term and long-term effects. However, it has been a challenge to study the cellular and
molecular mechanisms by which ATP and ADP control distinct signaling events because their levels are spatially
heterogeneous and purinergic signaling can vary significantly from cell-to-cell. Clearly, direct measurements of
extracellular nucleotides are needed, but current methods are not well adapted to measuring fluctuations in the
low extracellular nucleotide concentrations expected in live specimens. To overcome this barrier, we will use
protein engineering to develop high affinity cell-surface sensors that can be used to resolve the complex spatial
and temporal dynamics of ATP and ADP release, clearance, and purinergic receptor activation. To demonstrate
the application of our sensors and also guide their optimization, we will study neuron-glia purinergic signaling in
the brain. In particular, we will use our sensors to learn how metabolic state affects the function of microglia, the
resident immune cells in the brain, in regulating the regional purinergic dynamics that impact local neuronal
activity. The proposed series of multiplexed imaging studies that pair our purinergic sensors with sensors of
downstream signaling should directly visualize core elements of neuron-glia purinergic communication in an
integrated manner. This should provide valuable insight into novel mechanisms responsible for the coupling
between brain energy metabolism and excitability. Furthermore, the genetically-encoded tools developed
through this proposal should be broadly applicable to deeper study of any purinergic system.

High-throughput sequencing technology enables, among other things, experiments that produce
massive amounts of data about RNA transcripts in bacteria. These high-throughput sequencing
experiments continue to advance our understanding of bacterial transcriptomes, including
regulatory RNA genes, which pervade bacteria. However, processing the large resulting data
sets from high-throughput sequencing experiments can be a bottleneck in biological and
medical research studies, partly because existing methods are insufficient for analyzing these
data sets from bacteria.
 This project aims to develop new methods for processing high-throughput bacterial
sequencing data. A robust and user-friendly computational system will be implemented for end-
to-end analysis of high-throughput bacterial sequencing data. As part of this system, a novel
algorithm will be implemented to significantly reduce the time it takes for the most
computationally expensive stage of processing bacterial sequencing data, which is aligning
reads from sequencing experiments to a bacterial genome. While high-throughput bacterial
sequencing experiments commonly are performed on large sets of cells in bulk, recent
advances have made possible the effective use of these experiments on individual cells,
enabling greater resolution of bacterial transcriptome studies. New methods will be developed to
process high-throughput bacterial sequencing data from single-cell experiments. Further, a
computational system will be designed for systematic annotation of transcripts evinced from
bacterial sequencing data to aid biological and medical researchers in efficient and reliable
interpretation of the massive data sets. Finally, since many RNA genes in bacteria act as
regulators of other transcripts, novel approaches will be developed to identify the interactions
between these noncoding RNAs and their regulatory targets. The methods developed will be
applied and evaluated in different bacterial systems.

Mycophenolic acid (MPA) is a crucial immunosuppressive medication that prevents kidney transplant rejection
and prolongs the survival of the transplanted organ. MPA, however, is associated with dose-limiting side effects
of diarrhea and leukopenia. Recent animal studies have shown that MPA-related toxicities are dependent on the
gut microbiota, but our understanding of MPA reactivation in the gut and its contribution to associated toxicities
is incomplete. Understanding the impact of gut-mediated MPA reactivation is critical because transplant
physicians frequently encounter MPA-associated toxicities in clinical practice. Transplant physicians routinely
decrease the dosage of MPA during episodes of post-transplant diarrhea and leukopenia, but large studies have
shown that such actions are associated with acute organ rejection. Thus, it is imperative that we define the roles
played by gut bacterial beta-glucuronidase (GUS) enzymes in MPA reactivation, enterohepatic recirculation, and
associated toxicities.
The overall goals of this proposal are to identify the microbial GUS enzymes involved in reactivation of
MPA and to define the relationship between fecal GUS activity, MPA enterohepatic recirculation, and
MPA-associated toxicities in kidney transplant recipients. We hypothesize that specific microbial GUS
enzymes drive the reactivation and enterohepatic recirculation of MPA, and that quantitative fecal GUS enzyme
assays will serve as a biomarker for MPA-associated toxicities. Here we will study a cohort of 210 kidney
transplant recipients with and without MPA-associated toxicities. Our center at Weill Cornell routinely performs
approximately 250 kidney transplant recipients per year, supporting the feasibility of recruiting this number of
patients that will sufficiently power the study to successfully test our hypothesis. In Aim 1, we will define the gut
microbial GUS enzymes that reactivate MPA and the drugs that may disrupt them. In Aim 2, we will define the
relationship among quantitative fecal GUS activities, MPA enterohepatic recirculation, and MPA-associated
toxicities.
This project will reveal fundamental data about the gut microbiota's ability to reactivate MPA, influence
enterohepatic recirculation, and impact therapeutic tolerance. Importantly, it will assess fecal GUS enzyme
activity as a novel biomarker for MPA-associated toxicities, allowing for the development of more personalized
approaches to optimize MPA efficacy and minimize MPA-associated toxicities in kidney transplant recipients.

Genome-wide association studies have identified numerous genetic variants associated with type 1 and type 2
diabetes mellitus (T1DM and T2DM), many of which might affect genes that are involved in pancreatic β cell
function and survival. However, the exact biological functions and the mechanistic nature of these genetic
variants remain unclear. Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), provide, in theory, unlimited resources to
generate differentiated cells to study the role of genetic factors in human diseases. Of the diabetes-associated
genes identified so far, GLIS3 is the only one (other than insulin) associated with both T1DM and T2DM, and
neonatal diabetes mellitus (NDM). Recently, we reported an optimized strategy to efficiently derive GLIS3+
pancreatic β-like cells. Using this platform, we found that loss of GLIS3 causes impaired differentiation toward β
cells and increases β cell death.
Here, we propose to test the hypothesis that genetic and environmental factors caused loss or reduction of
GLIS3 impairs human pancreatic β cell generation, survival, and proliferation in both healthy and disease
conditions. In preliminary studies, we have created 2 isogenic T2DM-SNP-hESCs, 2 isogenic NDM-M-hESCs,
and 2 isogenic KO (knockout)-hESC lines. In addition, we identified a TGFβ inhibitor that rescues the increased
death rate in GLIS3-/- β-like cells. In this proposal, we will systematically study the differentiation of isogenic
T2DM-SNP-hESCs, NDM-M-hESCs, and GLIS3-KO-hESCs, exploring the generation, function, and survival of
the endocrine cells in the disease conditions. Additionally, we will explore the downstream mechanism of GLIS3.
Finally, we will develop approaches to improve β cell survival in T2DM conditions by targeting GLIS3 and its
downstream pathways. Toward these goals, the following aims are proposed: Aim 1. Evaluate the impact of
GLIS3-associated genetic variants in the generation and survival of human pancreatic β cells both in vitro and
in vivo. Aim 2. Decode the molecular mechanism of GLIS3 controlling human pancreatic β cell survival. Aim 3.
Rescue T2DM islets survival by targeting GLIS3 and its downstream mechanisms.
This proposal will systematically analyze the biological function of GLIS3 and associated variants in human β
cell's generation, survival, and proliferation. It will significantly enhance our knowledge of β cell biology, which
will pave the road for developing novel therapies for T2DM patients.

Cancer is among the leading causes of death worldwide and host-bacterial microbiota interactions
profoundly influence tumorigenesis, cancer progression and response to therapies. Nevertheless, the
role of fungi (mycobiota) in these processes remain largely unexplored, missing a potential opportunity
for developing novel diagnostic, preventative, and therapeutic strategies. Across the population,
colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer type. In addition to bacteria, we recently
described the presence of live, transcriptionally active fungi in colorectal cancers. Here, we preset
further evidence for the presence of active mycobiota in colorectal tumors and experimental data
supporting a hypothesis that fungi play an important role in colon cancer growth and response to
therapies through the interaction of fungal metabolites and virulence factors in the tumor macro- and
micro-environment. We will use novel methodologies and in vivo modeling allowing to determine fungal
species and factors that influence CRC. We will determine specific immune mediators and cells of the
immune system that interact with fungi in the tumors, and pinpoint mechanisms by which specific fungal
strains influence the tumor microenvironment and impact tumor growth. We will further characterize
fungi in tumors of patient and mice to determine the utility of the mycobiome as a predictor of cancer
progression, survival, and response to therapies. The results of these studies will contribute towards
better understanding of host-mycobiota interactions in cancer and might provide a basis for novel
diagnostic, therapeutic and co-therapeutic anticancer approaches in CRC by targeting the fungal arm
of the microbiome.

Background: Mammalian models of cancer have been instrumental in the development of many targeted
therapies. It is, however, difficult to establish these models, such as patient-derived cell cultures (PDCC) and
xenografts (PDX). As a result, most cancer types have only a limited number of models available, which do not
accurately reflect the diversity of human cancer in real life.
Innovation: The majority of the patient-derived models were developed using untreated primary samples with
plenty of tumor tissue. The next challenge in tumor modeling will require much more difficult samples, such as
minute residual tumor foci in a patient with a partial chemotherapy response. Even though cancer is a disease
of unchecked cell growth in the body, normal cells paradoxically proliferate faster than malignant cells in cell
culture. As a result, in the majority of PDCC models, the cancer cells eventually disappear. To address the issue
of normal cell overgrowth, we are creating a tumor-specific medium (TSM) that suppresses normal cell
proliferation.
Preliminary data: As a proof-of-concept, we published twenty-five new ovarian cancer cell (OvCa) lines that
retained the molecular, histologic, and outcome features of the patient tumors.
Objectives: Our goal is to create innovative and simple culture methods that enable the creation of patient-
derived cell cultures and PDX models and develop best practices for validating these models.
Specific Aims: We are working on five major solid tumor types (lung, breast, prostate, kidney, and ovary) and
a liquid tumor (leukemia) to illustrate that our system can be adapted to culture the full spectrum of tumor types.
Aim 1: Patient-Derived Culture of Solid Tumors: We will establish patient-derived lung, breast, prostate,
kidney, and ovary adenocarcinoma cultures and compare their molecular profiles with the original patient tumor.
Aim 2) Patient-Derived Culture of Solid Tumors: We will establish patient-derived AML cultures and compare
their molecular and phenotypic profiles with the original patient tumor.
Research Strategy: We will compare the genome, transcriptome, and proteome of each cell line with the original
patient tumor, existing cell lines, and tumor datasets.
Innovation: By suppressing the expansion of normal stromal cells and normal epithelium, the TSM culture
system can maintain cancer cell lines long-term without feeder layers, drugs, or extracts.
Impact: Predicting drug activity in the clinic has always been difficult using traditional cultural models. Therefore,
having access to biologically relevant lung, breast, prostate, kidney, ovary, and AML cell lines could revolutionize
cancer drug development.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
Telomeres are specialized protein-DNA structures that protect the ends of linear chromosomes and
maintain genomic stability. Maintenance of adequate telomere length is thus essential for cellular
immortalization and tumorigenesis. While most human cancers achieve this through telomerase
activation, ~ 5% - 10% of them adopt a recombination-based mechanism termed alternative lengthening
of telomeres (ALT) to elongate their telomeres. Although the ALT-driven cancers are generally aggressive
with poor prognosis, there are currently no targeted therapies. In human cancers, ALT is strongly
associated with genetic alterations that affect histone H3.3 chaperone ATRX-DAXX complex. We and
others previously demonstrated that the ATRX-DAXX complex is essential for normal telomere
maintenance. We showed that ATRX or DAXX loss, while promoting tumorigenesis by potentiating the
ALT-driven immortalization, also creates a persistent telomere replication dysfunction. We therefore
hypothesize that ALT-immortalized cancers must have adopted special mechanism(s) to offset their
innate telomere DNA replication defects, and thus would be selectively vulnerable to the inhibition of
those compensatory pathways. By combining our unique isogenic ALT-immortalization model system
and customized domain-focused CRISPR screen platform, we have uncovered a list of selective
molecular vulnerabilities including histone lysine demethylase KDM2A for ALT-dependent cells. We
demonstrate that KDM2A-mediated H3K36me2 demethylation is required for ALT-directed telomere
maintenance. Inactivation of KDM2A impairs ALT-specific multitelomere cluster dissolution, leading to
chromosome missegregation and mitotic cell death. The objectives of this proposal are to delineate the
molecular mechanism underlying ALT-directed telomere maintenance and to identify mechanism-based
therapeutic targets against ALT-driven human cancers. To meet those goals, we will pursue the following
three specific aims. In Aim 1, we will investigate the molecular functions of KDM2A in ALT-directed
telomere maintenance. In Aim 2, we will define the potential adverse effects and off-tumor toxicities of
future KDM2A-targeted therapies. In Aim 3, we will establish an in vivo platform to explore the synthetic-
lethal interactions of ALT-driven ATRX-mutant malignant gliomas. Completion of the proposed studies
will uncover the molecular mechanisms and critical dependencies underlying ALT-directed telomere
maintenance and thus drive the development of novel mechanism-based therapeutics against ALT-
dependent cancers including the ATRX mutant malignant gliomas.

Proteasome inhibitor (PI) drugs turned untreatable multiple myeloma treatable, significantly improve the
quality of life for multiple myeloma patients. There are three FDA-approved PI drugs. In additional to
multiple myeloma (MM), PI drugs are also approved to treat mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), amyloid light
chain (AL) amyloidosis and Waldenström macroglobulinemia, the latter two are noncurable rare
disorders related to plasma cells. Nevertheless, resistance inevitably occurs. All three drugs have
serious toxicities. A high percentage of patients suffer from neuropathy, a debilitating adverse effect
from two peptide boronate based PI drugs, bortezomib and ixazomib. Another PI drug carfilzomib also
has cardiovascular and renal toxicity. Notably, none of the PI drugs showed little clinical benefits in
treating patients with solid tumors in numerous clinical trials. Studies have shown that upon treatment
with PIs, a transcription factor NRF1 will be activated to express more proteasomes that renders PI
drugs less or non-effective. Recent studies show that when chymotryptic β5 and tryptic β2 of the
proteasomes are simultaneously inhibited, NRF1, instead of activation, forms aggregated, disarming the
ability of tumor cells to resist apoptotic stress induced from proteasome inhibition. Because of the
striking difference between the “chymotryptic” proteolytic preference of β5 to cleave after hydrophobic
residues and the “tryptic” preference of β2 to cleave after basic residues, it is challenging to develop
inhibitors that can target both β2 and β5 with similar potency. Besides, such β5β2 targeting inhibitors
would also have to spare the “acidic” β1 active subunit to avoid nonspecific cytotoxicity. No such
inhibitors have been reported in peptide boronate and peptide epoxyketone classes. There are three
known β5β2-inhibitors in other classes, all of them irreversible, carrying unpredictable toxicities. We
have now designed and characterized a group of macrocyclic peptide boronates that simultaneously
inhibit β5 and β2, but not β1. These compounds elicit markedly less NRF1 activation in triple negative
breast cancer cells (TNBC) than BTZ. We now aim to continue our team approach to advance the
structure-guided development of β5β2 inhibitors for cancer treatment by improving their specificity and
pharmaceutical properties and evaluate their in vitro anticancer activity and in vivo efficacy in animal
models of TNBC. In Aim 1 of this proposal, we will conduct structure-guided lead optimization to improve
β5β2-inhibitors’ potency, specificity and pharmacokinetic properties. In Aim 2, we will test β5β2-
inhibitors' cytotoxicity against breast cancer line cells. Aim 3 will test the efficacy of β5β2-inhibitors in in
animal models of TNBC.

Eradicating HIV from infected individuals is obstructed by the formation of a reservoir of persistent infected cells;
eliminating this reservoir could allow a cure for HIV infection. Recent research provides clues to approaches for
reservoir eradication. Rare, infected individuals, termed elite controllers (EC), control HIV without treatment with
antiretroviral medications. Analysis of HIV reservoirs in these individuals supports a model in which most
efficiently expressed HIV proviruses have been eliminated. Thus, integration sites of proviruses from ECs are
found enriched in genomic regions associated with heterochromatin and transcriptional repression. This overall
pattern is, however, violated by some clonally expanded infected cells with genic integrations that show ongoing
viral transcription. It has been suggested that these clones may have pro-survival and/or immune resistance
characteristics, but this remains poorly understood. Our team has shown that the above features can be
recapitulated by the application of CD8+ T-cell pressure in a novel mouse model of long-term infection, termed
the Participant Derived Xenograft (PDX) model. For this, T-cells are obtained from ECs and separated into
fractions. Naïve T cells are removed, which eliminates graft-versus-host disease upon transplantation into mice.
CD4+ memory T cells are transplanted into immunodeficient mice, then HIV is introduced. Autologous CD8+ T-
cells are introduced or not in controls, allowing experimental assessment of CD8+ T-cell pressure. In preliminary
data, in the presence of CD8+ T-cells, the selected proviral population is smaller and viral loads lower. Advanced
sequencing of integration site distributions shows larger clone sizes in the presence of CD8+ T-cell pressure,
and multiple features paralleling results in ECs, such as favored integration outside transcription units, integration
in reverse orientation relative to host transcription, and favored integration in more heterochromatic nuclear
compartments to name a few. Thus, we propose to use the PDX model, advanced integration site analysis, and
further tools to address the following Specific Aims: Aim 1. To define in high resolution the integration site
features that enable the persistence of HIV proviruses under extended in vivo selection by CD8+ T-cells and
compare the effects of diverse approach to enhancing this pressure. We will test multiple interventions in the
PDX model to increase CD8+ T-cell pressure, reverse latency or block its establishment, and characterize in
detail the molecular correlates. Aim 2. To train and validate multivariate statistical models to quantify the degree
of CD8+ T-cell selection on a given pro-viral landscape and use the models to infer selection in interventional
clinical trials. Completion of this study will thus provide advanced tools for quantifying CD8+ T-cell pressure on
populations of integrated HIV proviruses, rich information on the functions of latency and immune modulators in
the PDX model and in human trials, and an evaluation of the novel hypothesis that HIV insertional mutagenesis
can confer resistance to CD8+ T-cell-mediated killing.

 The human intestinal tract supports a complex microbial environment consisting of bacterial (or
microbiota) and fungal (or mycobiota) constituents. Although the role of each of these communities has been a
subject of multiple studies, the role of transkingdom interactions between fungi and bacteria in shaping host
immunity and physiology has been much less explored. The chemical basis for such interactions, critical for the
rational design of mechanistic studies with regards to host immunity and disease development, remain
completely uncharted territory in the literature. We have established a genetic manipulation pipeline to identify
gene transfer methodology and build a genetic tool for nonmodel human gut bacteria on a large scale. Via a
multifactorial optimization of their conjugation/transformation conditions and targeting bacterial conserved 16s
rRNA genes, this pipeline efficiently identified the gene transfer methods for multiple nonmodel gut bacterial
commensals and set up CRISPR-based or gene insertion tools in multiple of them. This library of genetically
targetable microbes comes from 5 different phyla. This genetic manipulation pipeline and this library of tractable
commensals will facilitate our investigation of trans-kingdom microbiota-mycobiota interactions at the molecular
level. A high throughput screening of bacterial metabolite libraries from gut bacteria identified metabolites with
direct effect on intestinal mycobiota. We identified bacterial species and corresponding gene clusters responsible
for the production of these metabolites. Our preliminary data suggest strong ties and specific molecular
interactions between fungi and bacteria in the gut that have previously unappreciated role in microbial dynamics,
metabolite production and immunity. We will utilize such bacterial strains and isogenic mutants in key
biosynthetic pathways to target metabolites with mycobiota modulatory properties. We will use several mouse
models and synthetic microbial communities to define the role of trans kingdom interaction between bacteria and
fungi in modulating host immunity and colonization resistance in the gut. We hypothesize that metabolites from
the human bacterial microbiota modulate the fungal communities in the gut to affect microbial composition, the
microbiome function and immunity. In addition to revealing novel mechanisms of fungal-bacterial interaction at
an unprecedented small molecule level, the results of this proposed investigation will illuminate potential new
strategies for targeting of fungal pathogens

Every day ~50 billion cells undergo apoptosis, or programmed cell death. Efficient recognition and clearance of
these cells is critical for tissue homeostasis in physiology and for its recovery following disease. Initiation of the
apoptotic cascade triggers activation of phospholipid scramblases that externalize the lipid phosphatidylserine
(PS) in the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane. Recognition of PS by dedicated receptors (PSRs) on immune
cells is the first and critical step in the clearance of apoptotic cells. Immune cells with activated PSRs create an
immunosuppressive environment that can be exploited by pathogens exposing PS in an immune-camouflage
strategy called apoptotic mimicry. Recent studies implicated members of the XKR protein family in apoptotic
scrambling. Dysfunction of XKR proteins results in an inflammatory environment and autoimmune disorders
while their uncontrolled activation favors oncogenesis and facilitate viral entry. Thus, it is critical to elucidate the
molecular mechanisms of XKR function and regulation to understand their physiological roles and their
association with pathology. Currently, only structures of non-functional XKR proteins are available, hindering our
understanding of how these protein mediate PS externalization. In preliminary experiments we show that two
XKR homologues, CED-8 from C. elegans and human XKR4, scramble lipids. Using cryogenic electron
microscopy, we determined the 3.55 Å resolution structure of hXKR4 in a novel, likely active conformation,
providing insights into a potential mechanism for lipid transport. In our 1st aim, we propose to determine the
structures of hXKR4 and CED-8 in different conformations and functional states to determine the molecular
bases of XKR activation. We will use our newly developed biochemical assays to probe and elucidate the
functional implications of these structures. The physiological implications of these mechanisms will be tested in
cell-based measurements. Our 2nd aim is to determine how XKR proteins scramble their surrounding membrane
lipids. Using cryoEM we will directly visualize the hXKR4 and CED-8 scramblases in the context of a membrane
to determine how they interact with and remodel the surrounding bilayer to enable lipid scrambling. Furthermore,
we will investigate how changes in the physicochemical properties of the membrane support different functional
states of these proteins. Our 3rd aim is to elucidate the regulatory mechanisms of XKR activity. Using in vitro
and cell-based functional assays, we will determine whether and how hXKR4 and CED-8 are directly regulated
by cellular factors, such as processing by apoptotic caspases, phosphorylation, or interactions with of a peptide
derived from the nuclear DNA repair protein XRCC4. Collectively, our studies will lay the foundation for future
investigations of the molecular underpinnings of the XKR scramblases in vivo.

Though significant epidemiological evidence highlights the significantly worse outcomes for HIV and tuberculosis
(TB) co-infections, the mechanisms underlying this increased risk have not been identified. This is particularly
important since all-cause mortality is four times higher for people living with HIV (PLHIV) that also have a history
of active TB compared to PLHIV without TB, regardless of TB cure and effective ART. This research team's
preliminary data suggest differences in the HIV reservoir, the latent HIV virus integrated into host cell DNA

etiology of increased all-cause mortality in PLHIV who have had active pulmonary TB.
The goal of Aim 2 is to determine HIV proviral burdens in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb)-specific CD4+ T-
cells in comparison to other antigen specificities. We will conduct a case-control study in New York City where
people living with HIV with (n=10) vs without (n=10) history of TB will have 5 billion white blood cells collected
via leukapheresis. We will stimulate leukapheresis-derived cells with peptide pools and quantitate HIV provirus
in CD4 cells responsive to different antigenic stimuli. Digital droplet PCR will be used to measure the percentage
of CD4 cells containing HIV. We hypothesize that Mtb peptide-responsive CD4 will be most likely to contain HIV
provirus, and thus contribute to the larger HIV reservoir seen in HIV-TB coinfection. Fundamental understanding
of TB's impact on HIV reservoir will have significant impact on HIV cure options in areas with high rates of TB.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：SUMMARY
Tuberculosis (TB) is the leading cause of death from a single infection worldwide, with an annual death toll of
over 1.6 million lives. TB is curable and drug regimens can be above 90% effective if completed but are long and
toxic leading to noncompliance and emergence of resistance. New treatment options relying on novel and
unexplored targets are scarce. The BPaL regimen recently approved by the FDA features, for the first time in
many decades, drugs against new Mtb targets (ATP synthase) and with novel mode of action (nitroimidazoles).
Nevertheless, more inhibitors against previously unexplored targets are urgently needed to sustain the TB drug
pipeline, as resistance is already detected to components of BPaL. Both shortages, in effective antibiotics and
unexplored targets, are even more glaring in the field of non-tuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) diseases which
are on a rise and are recognized now as an emerging global threat in both immunocompromised and
immunocompetent individuals. Mycobacterial lipoamide dehydrogenase (Lpd) represents one of the unexplored
but Mtb-validated targets and serves in at least 4 enzyme complexes in Mtb: in pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH),
-ketoacid dehydrogenase, branched chain keto-acid dehydrogenase, and peroxynitrite reductase/peroxidase.
Lpd is a genetically validated target: Mtb with lpd deleted does not survive in a mouse model of TB infection and
a conditionally regulated lpd Mtb strain is cleared in mice, when Lpd expression is suppressed in either the acute
or chronic infection. This application leverages the knowledge of the chemical biology of Mtb Lpd to explore our
newly identified tight binding inhibitors (TBI) of Mtb Lpd by structure-guided analysis, enzyme kinetics and
binding assays to define Lpd binding site features responsible for tight binding interactions and extensions of the
on-target residence time (t1/2). We aim to define what drives antibacterial activity of Lpd TBI, how t1/2 contributes
to whole cell activity and selectivity, and how we can design/predict better analogs with improved t1/2 to enable
further efficacy improvements. We will develop a framework for progression of TBIs from an isolated target to its
cellular PDH complex target and its whole cell activity against TB in culture and during host infection. Extension
of those studies to NTM pathogens and testing against Mycobacterium avium and M. abscessus Lpd orthologs
will lead to scaffold progression and SAR development of a novel whole cell active inhibitor of NTM. Collectively
our studies will explore the SAR of Lpd TBI in vitro, define vulnerability of mycobacterial Lpd to chemical inhibition
in vivo, advance our understanding of ways to improve inhibitors' efficacy through its target's t1/2, contribute to
rational prediction of in vivo efficacy and characterize structural features of mycobacterial PDH that define its
distinct macromolecular organization and sustain its functional diversity.

The aging vasculature and associated inflammation converge as a powerful force to cause two of the most
common cardiovascular conditions in older adults aged at least 75 years—heart failure with preserved ejection
fraction (HFpEF) and acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Despite the negative impact of HFpEF and AMI on
morbidity and mortality among older adults, there are no evidence-based strategies to prevent HFpEF and
AMI among older adults. There is a strong biologic rationale that statins could prevent HFpEF and/or AMI
events, given their capacity to mitigate endothelial dysfunction, suppress inflammation, and prevent ischemia.
However, no randomized controlled trial (RCT) to date has examined whether statins can prevent incident
HFpEF and/or AMI events in adults aged at least 75 years—the subpopulation at greatest risk for these events.
The objectives of this proposal are: (1) To determine whether statins prevent incident HFpEF hospitalizations
in older adults; (2) To determine whether statins prevent AMI events in older adults; (3) To determine the
impact of relying on diagnosis codes to identify HFpEF and AMI. This project is an ancillary study to the
ongoing NIH-funded Pragmatic Evaluation of Events And Benefits of Lipid-lowering in Older Adults
(PREVENTABLE) RCT, which is examining the risks and benefits of statins in adults aged at least 75 years.
Given its size (N~20,000), duration (~4 years follow-up), and study design (double-blinded, placebo-controlled,
randomized trial), PREVENTABLE offers an unprecedented opportunity to examine whether statins prevent
incident HFpEF and/or AMI events. However, the parent RCT’s reliance on diagnosis codes to ascertain
cardiovascular events will not allow detailed insights into HFpEF or AMI given the inherent limitations of
diagnosis codes to detect these events. This ancillary study will directly overcome this limitation by adding
expert-adjudicated outcomes through medical record review. This study will address a huge unmet clinical
need with high likelihood of informing clinical practice, and extend the impact of PREVENTABLE with minimal
additional burden on study sites or participants. Our team is uniquely qualified to carry out this proposed study
given our extensive experience with medical record retrieval on a national scale and with cardiovascular event
adjudication; and expertise in cardiovascular epidemiology, HFpEF, AMI, geriatric cardiology, and clinical trial
biostatistics. The long-term goal of this research is to identify prevention strategies for two of the most common
cardiovascular events among older adults. The expected outcomes of the proposed research are 1) potential
guideline-altering evidence on the effect of statins on incident HFpEF and AMI in older adults; and 2)
foundational data for optimizing the use of diagnosis codes for clinical, administrative, and research purposes
for studies of HF and AMI. This research directly addresses NHLBI Strategic Vision Objective 5 to “develop
and optimize novel… therapeutic strategies to prevent… diseases.”

The gastrointestinal tract is colonized by trillions of normally beneficial microbes (termed the microbiota), as well
as serves as an entry site for pathogens. Therefore, the intestinal immune system must remain tolerant to foreign
non-harmful stimuli meanwhile provide protection against infections. Accumulating evidence indicates that a
dysregulated immune response in the intestine is causally associated with infectious, inflammatory, and
metabolic diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Despite these advances, the cellular and
molecular mechanisms controlling protective versus inflammatory properties of immune responses within the
intestine remain incompletely defined. The long-term goal of the candidate is to investigate how diverse immune
and stromal cells are regulated to promote health and homeostasis in the mammalian intestine. The candidate’s
recent work identified a novel transcription factor that is expressed by group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s) and
specifically restrains the proinflammatory properties of ILC3s to promote intestinal health and protect against
inflammation (Zhou et al., Nature, 2022). Based on this and new preliminary data, the candidate hypothesizes
that this transcriptional regulator is an essential immune modulator limiting tissue inflammation and promoting
intestinal health by acting across distinct cell types. The objectives of this proposal are to understand the
regulation and functions of this transcription factor in intestinal health and inflammation across distinct cell types.
Aim 1 will identify the direct targets of this transcription factor and how it regulates intestinal immunity. Aim 2
will investigate its functional significance in inflammation and dissect the molecular mechanisms by which it
controls intestinal inflammation. Aim 3 will determine the upstream signals that modulate expression of this
transcription factor, assess the impacts of intestinal inflammation on gene expression, and interrogate the
physiological consequences of these context-dependent expression alterations in intestinal health and
inflammation. The results from this proposal will advance our understanding of essential pathways that shape
mucosal immunity and impact the pathogenesis of IBD, which could provoke the development of novel
therapeutic strategies targeting this transcriptional regulator or downstream mediators in inflammatory disorders
of the gut. Career goals of the candidate are to become an independent investigator at an academic institute
studying the cellular and molecular mechanisms that promote intestinal health. To fulfil these scientific and career
goals, the candidate has support from a multidisciplinary advisory team with extensive experience on areas
related to the proposed research and mentoring trainees to independence. The candidate has developed a plan
to acquire necessary technique skills, advance scientific writing and communication skills, and enhance
laboratory management and mentoring abilities during the K99 phase. This K99/R00 Award will permit an
outstanding training opportunity, allow the candidate to successfully complete the proposed novel research, and
flourish as an independent scientist focusing on mucosal immunity and gastrointestinal health.

Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death and affects about 13 out of 100
American men. The standard diagnosis approach for prostate cancer incorporates prostate specific-
antigen (PSA) blood test, digital rectal examination and biopsy, and, recently, the Prostate Imaging
Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) that localizes and stratifies the risk of lesions in biparametric
MRI (bpMRI) images. Detection of clinically significant cancer (csPCa) remains a challenge, resulting
in over- and underdiagnosis. Thus, accurate diagnosis and staging of prostate cancer will have a
significant impact on successful treatment planning and clinical management. As large-scale imaging
datasets become widely available in clinical settings, more prostate cancer studies are adopting
machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques. However, the common approach in the
existing studies has a drawback of using imaging findings, e.g., lesion size and radiomics features.
This project aims to implement and validate cutting-edge DL-based frameworks for the diagnosis and
prognosis of prostate cancer while fully utilizing imaging data and clinical scores (e.g., initial PSA
level and prostate genomic score). The proposed project will use state-of-the-art DL architectures
such as U-Net, image transformer and neural additive model to develop frameworks for robust DL-
based prostate and zonal anatomy segmentation (Aim 1), prediction of a csPCa probability map (Aim
2), and forecast of biochemical recurrence using interpretable multimodal DL framework (Aim 3). We
expect these frameworks will offer novel techniques adapted for prostate cancer, unique and
interpretable features from multimodal markers to better understand diagnosis and prognosis, and will
eventually help guide treatment selection and clinical management. This project will build on Dr. Kim's
quantitative background in modeling and analysis of neuroimaging data. During the project, Dr. Kim
will gain clinical expertise in prostate cancer via formal training driven by coursework (e.g., oncology
and biology) and research mentorship. Through the K25 award, Dr. Kim will lay the groundwork for
establishing an independent research program of computational methods for prostate cancer.

reproductive health while providing mentorship to the next generation of patient-oriented investigators. The
training that Dr. Downs offers leverages ongoing funded research in Tanzania in Aims 2-4 (2 NIH R01s and
foundation awards) and a newly funded women's reproductive health research project among Syrian refugees
in Lebanon (Aim 5). United States (US) trainees from Weill Cornell will be supported by NIH research training
grants and spend >50% of their time at their international sites in Tanzania or Lebanon. The projects include:
 1. HPV persistence and cervicovaginal dysbiosis in women with schistosome infections
 2. Genital mucosal, immune, and viral effects of female genital schistosomiasis
 3. Effects of Schistosoma mansoni on the gut mucosal response to oral poliovirus vaccine and gut
 immune cell populations
 4. Implementation science to promote women's reproductive health through religious institutions
 5. Implementation science to develop a mobile reproductive health intervention for Syrian refugee women
Research training will focus on a diverse pool of clinical trainees ranging from medical students to junior
faculty. Dr. Downs has a strong track record of mentoring patient-oriented researchers. She founded and leads
the Weill Cornell Women in Global Health Research Initiative. Her trainees will participate in this longitudinal
mentorship initiative and work in US-international partnerships on research projects in Tanzania (Aims 1-4) and
Lebanon (Aim 5). These 5 projects offer robust clinical, translational, and implementation science training. The
K24 award will enable Dr. Downs to decrease her administrative responsibilities and commit 50% effort to
research and mentorship. She will seek formal training in mentorship and strengthen her skills in HPV
research, working towards her long-term goal of building a world-class research and training program to

The objective of this career development plan and proposed research is to support my development into an
independent investigator focused on resuscitation science, who can successfully conduct mechanism-driven
and patient-oriented research for the development of novel clinical therapies in resuscitation and
cardiovascular critical care. Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is a leading cause of death in the U.S. and
worldwide with less than 20% of patients surviving to hospital discharge and many survivors experiencing
neurologic injuries. Resuscitation guidelines have espoused treatment recommendations in the delivery of
high-quality cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and the evaluation for underlying causes of OHCA. However,
despite these approaches, a substantial number of patients do not survive, suggesting a crucial need to seek
new strategies in resuscitation care. Obstruction of the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) by chest
compressions has been identified as an important factor causing ineffective CPR, but neither the
hemodynamic nor the clinical impact of this has been well-established. Due to its endoscopic location,
transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) can visualize the heart during the delivery of CPR, conveying unique
real-time and actionable data. This K23 resubmission proposal builds upon prior work by our team
demonstrating that TEE can be deployed rapidly and safely during resuscitation of OHCA patients, providing
high-quality dynamic imaging of the heart and major vascular structures during CPR. Furthermore, since the
original submission our team has successfully implemented a multi-center registry with 25 centers currently
participating, and demonstrated the feasibility to obtain clinical, hemodynamic, and TEE data in patients with
OHCA and in-hospital cardiac arrest. Leveraging this unique experience and infrastructure, as well as a
multidisciplinary team of content-specific mentors, the objectives of this proposal are to perform focused
clinical investigations, aimed to quantify the hemodynamic and clinical effects of TEE-guided CPR, and to
elucidate the barriers to successful implementation of this intervention in acute care settings. In Aim1, I will
leverage the existing infrastructure of our ongoing research network to conduct a multicenter observational
cohort study of adults with atraumatic SCA, aimed to evaluate the impact of TEE guidance of CC location on
hemodynamic endpoints and survival to hospital discharge. In Aim 2, using a mixed methods approach, I will
characterize the implementation determinants, barriers, and facilitators of TEE-informed resuscitation. The
results of this research could enhance the effectiveness of CPR, provide the basis for a novel patient-centric
approach with the potential to impact over 400,000 patients with cardiac arrest annually in the U.S. The
proposed activities will provide the PI with unique skills in the areas of pragmatic clinical trials, cardiovascular
physiology, and dissemination and implementation science, required to develop, evaluate and implement
interventions to improve survival and neurological outcomes from cardiac arrest.

This proposal is for a five-year research career development program, focused on understanding how
“neutropenic inflammation” activates the endothelium toward programmed cell death and the protective role of
necrotic cell death protein receptor interacting protein kinase-3 (RIPK3) in this inflammatory environment. The
candidate has been appointed Assistant Professor in the Department of Medicine at Weill Cornell Medicine. This
proposal is a natural extension of the candidate's previous research in high vascular injury ARDS populations
(Price DR, AJRCCM, 2021; ICM, 2021) and vascular cell death work in ARDS (Price DR, Am J Patho, 2023). It
outlines a plan for the candidate to achieve his goal of becoming an expert in vascular biology and acute lung
injury, extending the training of the candidate as identified here and reflected in the mentorship of Dr. Augustine
Choi and Dr. Shahin Rafii: 1. Define the role of neutropenic inflammation in mouse lung injury and human
organoid models, and 2. Determine a functional role for RIPK3 in inflammatory acute lung injury, and 3. Define
important necrotic cell death and vascular injury biomarkers in inflammatory ARDS. The proposed experiments
and the exciting training plan will impart the candidate with a unique combination of skills that will position him to
transition into a successful independent physician scientist studying vascular injury in ARDS.
The acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a common, often fatal, inflammatory lung injury for which
there are limited therapeutic options. The role of vascular injury as a disease-modifying factor in ARDS
pathogenesis has been well established. In contrast, the functional significance of an aberrantly injured vascular
cell upregulating necrotic cell death proteins, including receptor interacting protein kinase 3 (RIPK3), remains
largely unexplored in ARDS investigations, representing a potential target for future ARDS therapeutics. In this
proposal, I leverage my recent work highlighting neutropenic ARDS as a high endothelial stress population to
propose studies that test how excessive “neutropenic inflammation” activates the endothelium toward
programmed cell death and the protective role of endothelial RIPK3 in this inflammatory environment. To do this,
I have developed a neutropenic lung injury model that activates the lung endothelium and promotes RIPK3
expression. In Aim1, we will define the role of neutropenic inflammation in mouse lung injury and human organoid
models. In Aim 2, we will determine a functional role for endothelial RIPK3 in acute lung injury using gene
targeted mice, specifically the endothelial cell-specific deletion of RIPK3 mice. And in Aim 3, we will characterize
dysregulated cell death and vascular permeability pathways in inflammatory ARDS by correlate circulating
necroptosis and vascular permeability proteins with mortality and clinical indices of acute lung injury. Collectively,
these studies will provide novel insight into pathways of neutropenic inflammation and endothelial RIPK3 in
regulating vascular injury in ARDS.

 Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of late-onset dementia, known for the presence of
amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles of hyperphosphorylated tau. There is a portion of patients with AD
who develop symptoms before the age of 65, known as early-onset autosomal dominant AD (ADAD), caused by
mutations in the presenilin-1 (PSEN1) gene. A specific kindred of these patients was identified for having PSEN1
E280A mutations in Colombia, leading to mild cognitive impairment in their early 40s and dementia by late 40s.
One patient from this kindred interestingly did not develop any memory deficits until she was in her 70s.
Postmortem analyses showed that in addition to her PSEN1 E280A mutation, she also was homozygous for a
mutation in her APOE3 gene, known as the Christchurch mutation (APOE3cc). Apolipoprotein E (APOE) is a
lipid transporter that is expressed by astrocytes and microglia in the central nervous system and is the most
common risk factor for AD. Ultimately, a better understanding of how this mutation yields resilience against ADAD
could be a promising therapeutic target for AD.
First, we created a mouse model of human APOE3cc to replicate the patient’s rare homozygous mutation
in mice. We leveraged single nuclei RNA sequencing (snRNAseq) to elucidate which cell types could be
responsible for APOE3cc’s resilience. The snRNAseq data implicated both microglia and astrocytes as
regulators of APOE3cc’s neuroprotection. In microglia, our data showed that ApoEcc/cc+P301S mice significantly
downregulated several interferon genes. High levels of type-I interferons in the CNS, present in both aging and
neurodegeneration, have been associated with detrimental effects on cognition. In astrocytes, ApoEcc/cc+P301S
mice showed reprogramming of mitochondrial and antioxidant genes. Oxidative stress and neurodegeneration
are inextricably linked, and having increased antioxidant genes could explain downstream resiliency in the
patient. Additionally, previous studies have linked oxidative stress to activation of the interferon pathway. I
hypothesize that the combination of microglial interferon suppression and astrocytic antioxidant
reprogramming protect against tau-mediated dysfunction in the ApoE3cc/cc mice. To test this hypothesis,
we aim to determine the following: 1) determine the relationship of the interferon response in ApoE3cc/cc microglia
to neuronal health and neurite outgrowth. 2) analyze the ApoE3cc/cc astrocytic mitochondrial, antioxidant, and
metabolic response to tauopathy. Both aims will utilize a combined in vivo and in vitro approach.

Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are clonal blood disorders, whose pathogenesis is driven by a class of
oncogenic somatic mutations in RNA splicing factors (in the genes SRSF2, SF3B1, U2AF1, and ZRSR2) in up
to 80% of cases. Efforts to target these mutations in MDS with splicing modulatory drugs have been largely
unsuccessful, and there is a great need for improved therapy. To this end, our group previously demonstrated
that mis-spliced mRNAs induced by splicing modulatory drugs can serve as rich sources of immunogenic
tumor antigens. Based on this proof-of-concept work, we hypothesize that mis-spliced mRNA isoforms induced
by spliceosomal gene mutations can also generate meaningful tumor antigens that can be targeted by cognate
T-cell receptor (TCR) therapeutics. The long-term goal of this project is to develop novel antigen-based TCR
therapeutics for MDS with spliceosomal mutations. Spliceosomal mutations are also prevalent in clonal
hematopoiesis (CH) and associated with an increased risk of progression to MDS and acute myeloid leukemia,
and the project also aspires to develop safe and effective immunization strategies for these genomic subtypes
of CH.
The immediate objectives of the project are to identify mis-splicing-derived tumor antigens induced by
spliceosomal mutations as well as their cognate TCRs. In Aim 1, we will predict such tumor antigens by
analyzing RNA-Seq datasets of myeloid leukemia patient samples and performing immunopeptidomics. We will
then validate candidate peptides in vitro for their HLA binding affinity and ability to elicit CD8+ T cell responses.
In Aim 2, we will identify antigen-specific CD8+ T cells in MDS patient peripheral blood and bone marrow and
extract their TCR sequences using dextramer-based single-cell multiomics. We will validate the potency and
specificity of the identified TCRs both in vitro and in vivo.
Overall, the project will (1) corroborate our previously findings that mis-spliced mRNAs are viable
immunotherapeutic targets and (2) inspire novel immunotherapies such as TCR therapeutics for MDS patients
and vaccines for subjects with CH. Dr. Omar Abdel-Wahab, a clinician-scientist with expertise in spliceosomal
mutations in MDS and passion for mentoring future clinician-scientists, will sponsor the project. Dr. David
Scheinberg, also a clinician-scientist with expertise in TCR therapeutics as well as a track-record of training
multiple MD-PhD students, will co-sponsor the project. The research efforts will take place at the Sloan
Kettering Institute, where its researchers have made tremendous contributions to the understanding and
clinical implementation of immunotherapies into cancer medicine. Direct mentorship from Dr. Abdel-Wahab
and Dr. Scheinberg, combined with the guidance provided by the Tri-Institutional MD-PhD Program, will ensure
the successful completion of the proposed project and prepare the applicant for the future career path as an
independent investigator.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB), remains the leading cause of death
amongst infectious causes. While we have made progress reducing TB mortality, disease burden has stagnated
due to our inability to reduce the incidence rate of TB. This can be attributed to our lack of transmission blocking
interventions and the highly infectious nature of Mtb’ s aerosol transmission. Aerosolization represents an
essential physiologic process for Mtb’ s transmission and infectious life cycle that can be targeted to reduce TB
transmission and incidence. Mtb has likely evolved an adaptive response to the dramatic microenvironment
changes it experiences as it transitions from the nutrient-rich lung to the desolate atmosphere. The specific
genes and metabolic pathways that Mtb employs to navigate these changes are poorly understood. In the aerosol
droplet environment, Mtb is deprived of CO2 and nitrogen sources which provide the carbon and nitrogen building
blocks on which Mtb relies for biosynthetic processes. My project seeks to understand metabolic mechanisms
underlying Mtb’ s response to CO2 and nitrogen deprivation. Preliminary data from our lab has identified arginine
biosynthesis as a key metabolic pathway mediating Mtb’ s response to CO2 limitation. I propose that arginine
biosynthesis mediates Mtb survival in the CO2 and nitrogen limited aerosol droplet environment, by maintaining
a steady flux of carbamoyl phosphate, thermodynamically activated and short-lived essential intermediate. In
this model, I propose that arginine biosynthesis is configured as a cycle mediated by ArcA or Rv2323c, a currently
uncharacterized protein which I hypothesize to act as an arginine dihydrolase. Through this configuration,
arginine biosynthesis couples NH4+ regeneration in ArcA or Rv2323c catalysis with the oxidative production of
CO2 in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. I hypothesize that Mtb can regulate between Rv2323c and ArcA based
on nutrient availability. I predict that Mtb preferentially uses ArcA during CO2 and nitrogen limitation, since ArcA
can mediate an arginine cycle without consuming CO2 and NH4+ equivalents. I will test this hypothesis with three
Aims. In Aim 1, I will identify the biochemical role of Rv2323c in arginine metabolism through in vitro and in vivo
characterization of Rv2323c’s catalytic activity and physiologic function. In Aim 2, I will characterize the roles of
ArcA and Rv2323c in CO2 limited environments and measure their contributions to the endogenous pool of CO2
and impact on Mtb survival in air. In Aim 3, I will characterize the role of ArcA and Rv2323c in nitrogen limited
environments by determining Mtb’ s preference for either enzyme in these conditions and their impact on Mtb’ s
survival. These approaches will reveal novel insights into Mtb’ s adaptive response to aerosolization with the
potential of identifying therapeutic targets to block Mtb transmission.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Project Summary
Organelles engage in homeostatic processes to improve cellular health. However, some organelle proteins in
the soma can survive many months, making them susceptible to damage during aging. In the germline, gametes
can be arrested for a prolonged period before they pass down their organelle content to the next generation.
Having damage-prone proteins perdure in the germline would therefore be problematic and challenge the ability
of germ cells to pass down healthy material from generation to generation. Upon oocyte maturation and
fertilization, certain maternal products are degraded to initiate the maternal to zygotic transition in the developing
embryo, though little is known how maternally derived organelles are turned over and replaced with zygotic
organelles. Intriguingly, quality control events have been shown to take place in single cell organisms and during
asymmetric divisions to ensure the elimination of organelle long-lived proteins (LLPs). However, whether
specialized organelle quality control takes places to remove maternally derived LLPs in developing progeny, and
how such a process would take place in a multi-cellular organism remains poorly understood. Through molecular
and genetic analysis, the research proposed in this fellowship will investigate how maternal organelle input
derived from Drosophila oocytes influences germline health of their offspring. First, I will endogenously tag well
characterized LLPs to visualize the zygotic pool of proteins along with the maternally derived long-lived pool of
the same protein across embryonic, larval and adult progeny. By differentially tagging the maternal and zygotic
pool, I will compare protein levels in the progeny germline to assess if it selectively prevents maternally deposited
organelle LLPs to be transgenerationally inherited. Next, I will perturb oocyte health to investigate how maternally
damaged LLPs contributes to offspring viability. Finally, I will identify additional long-lived proteins that are
derived from maternal organelles using a biorthogonal amino acid labeling approach and compare their fates in
the progeny germline with well characterized LLPs. The proposed experiments will highlight how maternally
derived LLPs impact organelle function in the germline of ensuing progeny. In addition, these studies will shed
light on how organelle continuity is maintained between generations and aim to reveal specialized quality control
pathways in the germline.

recover from opioid use disorder (OUD), but only a fraction access specialty treatment or receive an
FDA-approved medication. Community Reinforcement and Family Training (CRAFT) works with family
members to get treatment resistant individuals (Identified Persons; IPs) into treatment, and 68% of families
coached in CRAFT achieve treatment entry for their IP; about twice as many as comparison groups. However,
most addiction professionals (counselors) are not trained in CRAFT or deliver it with questionable fidelity. The
goal of this project is to develop and evaluate the technical feasibility and commercial viability of a
scalable digital counselor training program for CRAFT. The Counselor product would be tailored to
prepare counselors to work with family members of individuals with OUD. It will allow counselors to deliver
high-fidelity CRAFT and significantly benefit IPs and their families affected by OUD by addressing the critical
barrier of access to a leading evidence-based approach to family involvement in addiction recovery. Current
methods for training counselors and disseminating ESTs, including CRAFT, rely on brief online or in-person
workshops. However, research shows this format is minimally effective in facilitating adoption and
implementation of ESTs. A more efficacious model includes ongoing counselor training with feedback and
coaching. This project will develop an enhanced training model for CRAFT and digitize it to maximize
scalability. In this project, we will: Produce the digital counselor training prototype and coaching process,
tailored to OUD - with stakeholder input (Aim 1); Conduct a pilot study of 3 levels of digital training (Level 1
-Digital tutorial only [T]; Level 2 -Tutorial & digital training materials for self-study [TM]; Level 3 – Tutorial, digital
materials, feedback and coaching [TMC]) to establish feasibility, acceptability, and examine the effects of
training on CRAFT knowledge, fidelity, and treatment entry and retention (Aim 2). Validation of feasibility and
commercial merit in the Phase I pilot study will provide substantiation to advance to Phase II. In addition to
optimizing the product based on Phase I learnings and stakeholder input, Phase II goals will include
completing development of a supervised machine learning (SML) automated coding system that will score
counselor-submitted digital audiotapes of CRAFT sessions and generate written feedback including
suggestions for improvement. This will allow us to demonstrate digital training efficacy at scale and commercial
readiness (Aim 3). We will conduct a fully-powered randomized control trial comparing all piloted outcomes for
the 3 training level conditions (Aim 4). These studies form the basis to demonstrate commercial readiness and
value to purchasers.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：SUMMARY
The textbook view of bacterial genomes shows a set of discrete genes, transcribed individually or as operons.
Transcription initiates at promoters upstream of these genes/operons, producing mostly protein-coding mRNAs
along with a smaller number of stable, functional RNAs (tRNAs, rRNAs, sRNAs). Transcription factors bind close
to promoters and regulate transcription from those promoters. Transcription terminates downstream of genes, in
3’ UTRs. This view has been the basis for decades of work on gene expression and gene regulation, with
enormous advances in our understanding of these processes. However, work from my group and others has
shown that bacterial genomes are far more complex. We will leverage my expertise in genetics, genomics, and
molecular biology, to continue productive lines of research on four overlapping topics that relate to the major
research focus of my group: the unexpected complexity of bacterial genomes. My lab has been very
productive on this topic, with 19 papers since 2016 directly relevant to the four themes described in this proposal.
Topic #1. Pervasive transcription. We and others have shown that most bacterial promoters are not in
intergenic regions, upstream of genes. Rather, they are located within genes, in sense or antisense orientations,
and are involved in “pervasive transcription”, whereby short, non-coding RNAs are transcribed before being
rapidly terminated by Rho and degraded. The majority of these RNAs are believed to be non-functional, and
suppression of pervasive transcription is required to maintain cell fitness.
Topic #2. Non-canonical transcription factor (TF) binding. We have mapped the direct and indirect regulatory
targets of hundreds of TFs across a wide range of bacterial species. Most TF binding sites are located within
genes, not intergenic regions. Moreover, most TF binding events are not associated with detectable regulation
of a nearby gene. Our data also show that in vivo binding profiles are often not well explained by a DNA sequence
motif, suggesting a role for other factors in determining the genomic sites of TF binding.
Topic #3. Widespread gene regulation by attenuation. We have shown that transcription of many Escherichia
coli genes is prematurely terminated by the conserved termination factor Rho, either in the 5’ UTR or ORF, a
process commonly referred to as “attenuation”. Attenuation has been described previously, but our data indicate
that it happens on a much larger scale than previously appreciated. We are interested in the mechanisms of
attenuation involving Rho termination, with a particular focus on the role of upstream ORFs (uORFs) that function
as cis-acting regulators, since we have identified large numbers of these ORFs in diverse bacterial species.
Topic #4. Processive antitermination. RNA polymerase can be protected from the action of the Rho
termination factor in a process known as “processive antitermination”. We will identify new regulatory targets of
known antiterminator proteins, we will determine the mechanisms of antitermination, and we will discover new
antiterminator proteins.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
 Quorum sensing (QS) is a mechanism of cell-cell communication that bacteria use to orchestrate
collective behaviors, including virulence and biofilm formation. QS relies on the production, release, and group-
wide detection of extracellular signal molecules called autoinducers (AI). QS allows bacteria to synchronously
alter gene expression patterns that underpin collective behaviors, for example, biofilm formation. Some receptors
bind and respond exclusively to one AI, while others bind and respond to multiple AIs. QS is responsible for
releasing public goods that are beneficial to kin and, potentially, non-kin, and as a result, it plays an important
role in shaping microbial community architecture. QS is now understood to be the norm in the bacterial world.
Nonetheless, how different bacterial QS receptors initiate signal transduction is not understood. Defining the
mechanisms that regulate QS-mediated production of public goods will be key for generally understanding how
organisms coordinate community level changes in gene expression. This is particularly important in light of our
findings that P. aeruginosa QS can be activated by signals produced by non-kin. Thus, determining the
mechanisms that regulate QS progression after signal recognition will allow us to understand the respective
benefits and drawbacks of strict versus relaxed ligand detection in QS-mediated communication. Bacteria live in
heterogeneous communities and encounter mixtures of AIs produced by themselves, their kin, and their non-kin
neighbors. Upon signal recognition, LasR and RhlR activate hundreds of genes, many of which are involved in
pathogenesis and biofilm formation. While some signal transduction pathways follow a linear circuit, the QS
system in P. aeruginosa is best described as a dense network of receptors and regulators with interconnecting
regulatory systems and outputs. Canonically, the LasR-AI complex activates expression of rhlR and rhlI, thus
launching the second QS system, enabling the two QS systems to function in tandem. Surprisingly, rhlR can be
upregulated in clinical isolates containing lasR inactivating mutations. RhlR can also function without its partner
synthase to regulate certain genes. This is achieved via a metallo-hydrolase known as PqsE. We discovered
that PqsE and RhlR interact to form a complex. We will explore the role of PqsE in regulating RhlR function and
describe their tandem role in transcriptional regulation and pathogenesis in AIM 1. The progression into QS
corresponds to a downregulation of certain regulatory elements that function at low cell density to potentially
mitigate early entry into QS. We have discovered that Fis, which is expressed during log phase, regulates the
production of rhlA, a gene responsible for the synthesis of rhamnolipids, which are a bacterial surfactant
important for infections. We will explore the mechanism Fis uses to achieve this regulation, in addition to what
role it might play in regulating other QS genes and behaviors in AIM 2.

Prostate cancer is the leading cancer diagnosis in men (not including skin cancer) and has high survival rates
(98% at 5 years), resulting in an estimated 3.2M US men currently living with prostate cancer. However, data
shows follow up among prostate cancer patients remains a significant challenge. A recent study at Dana-
Farber/Brigham and Women’s Cancer Center (DF/BCC) demonstrated its novel Virtual Prostate Cancer Clinic
(VPCC) increased access to care for new patients by 1110% and expanded revenue by 174% in four years.
Leveraging knowledge gained by the VPCC’s preliminary studies and to address this challenge in the market,
Vizlitics will develop a Software-as-a-Service product on top of its existing Cancer Insights (CI) platform in
collaboration with its research partners at DF/BCC to serve US cancer centers and community oncologists.
Known as VIPCare, this new CDSS will automatically monitor, track, and optimally classify prostate cancer cases
for triage by applying advanced algorithms to curated medical data. The cloud-based platform will ingest and
curate cancer patient medical records, including unstructured notes and apply Markov Decision Process (MDP)
modeling of patient longitudinal data onto published surveillance guidelines. VIPCare will automatically retrieve
new medical record data to keep models current with the latest tests and encounters and then compute a
classification probability for a patient being in each care protocol (active surveillance, active treatment, or post-
treatment surveillance) and the probability of moving from one care protocol to another. In addition, the model
will provide a recommendation for whether the patient should be followed by an electronic, virtual or in-person
visit with an APP or physician. This approach will: 1) improve follow-up of surveillance patients by scaling an
already validated approach, 2) leverage MDP to reduce the need for manual data entry, medical record review
and hands-on patient management, and 3) improve allocation of clinic resources. Phase I Specific Aims are to:
1. Develop a MDP model by incorporating prostate cancer guidelines on longitudinal patient data. Using
retrospective patient data, the team will apply the MDP model to compute probabilities for current and future care
based on latest tests and medical record data. 2. An optimization algorithm will use the probability scores created
in Aim 1, patient preferences, and provider constraints to compute the triage recommendation for each patient.
The dashboard will give the overview status of each patient individually and the entire patient population globally.
3. In lab usability testing will be run as well as accuracy testing of the classification and optimization algorithms.
At the end of Phase I, the company will have demonstrated feasibility of VIPCare, achieving acceptable user
testing and computation model accuracy ≥80%. Phase II will be a real-time test pilot of VIPCare at a prostate
cancer clinic with additional technical enhancements in preparation for commercialization. Significant market
opportunities exist for a tool like VIPCare that can offer demonstrated cost savings, increased practice efficiency
and improved patient outcomes.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
Warmer temperatures have been associated with increased virus transmission and emergence of novel
pathogens and vectors in new locations. Temperature is well documented to have a significant effect on viral
fitness and replication, which is particularly relevant in ectothermic vectors of enzootic viruses such as
mosquitoes. Temperature also impacts numerous aspects of invertebrate biology and therefore is a critical
factor influencing the transmission potential of vector populations. Studies to date which aim to model
environmental effects on population level viral dynamics assume static biological systems. Given the strong
effects of temperature on viral replication rates (and consequently evolutionary rates), the variability of vector
species and population responses to temperature, and the documented role of interactions among viral
genotype and environment in governing transmission, this assumption is flawed. This represents a clear gap in
our understanding of pathogen transmission theory and a barrier to developing accurate predictive models.
West Nile virus (WNV; Flavivirus, Flaviviridae) is the most prevalent arbovirus in the U.S. and the ideal
candidate for modeling how temperature and viral genotype interact to influence transmission and evolution of
arboviruses in dynamic vector populations. There is large variability in prevalence in mosquitoes over both fine
and broad temporal and geographic scales, and this variability has been well-documented in the U.S. Variation
in temperature and viral genotypes have also been documented over similar scales. We will utilize novel
laboratory data to refine predictions of arbovirus transmission under various evolutionary and climate
scenarios, and ultimately to create more informed predictive models that should have broader implications for
vector-borne pathogens.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Distributive Conjugal Transfer (DCT) is a unique conjugation process, first described in Mycobacterium
smegmatis, which is so robust that it emulates the genome mixing capacity of sexual reproduction:
transconjugant genomes are mosaic blends of each parent. Thus, DCT is a new paradigm of conjugation,
evolution, and horizontal gene transfer (HGT)-mediated gene flow within a bacterial gene pool. Our long-
term goals are to elucidate the mechanism of DCT and understand its role in driving mycobacterial
evolution.
We recently defined a three-gene mating identity locus (mid) as critical for donor-recipient compatibility.
Remarkably, one gene within the locus, midA, confers mycobacterial self-identity (kin). If the identical
midA gene is expressed in both donor and recipient, DCT is prevented as the cells sense kin. The focus
of this proposal is to characterize this novel form of kin recognition in mycobacteria, and to determine
how it triggers/blocks DCT. Sequence comparisons of the three mid proteins in other mycobacteria shows
that they are highly polymorphic. We hypothesize that this sequence diversity is driven by the need to
express self-identity. MidA is predicted to have a small N-terminal cytoplasmic domain and a large
extracellular C-terminal domain. We propose a model in which direct cell contact between donor and
recipient would allow the interaction of the surface exposed MidA proteins to sense kin. The N-terminal
cytoplasmic domain would trigger a transcriptional response in the recipient that either activates (non-
kin) or prevents (kin) progression to conjugation.
The two Aims are designed to characterize the mycobacterial kin recognition protein(s), determine how
mid discriminates between contacting mycobacteria, and elucidate the molecular genetic pathways
triggered by mid.
Aim1. Define and characterize the mid locus and the encoded kin functions.
Aim 2. Identify and characterize the genes responsible for kin recognition in donor and recipient strains
by transcriptional profiling wild-type and mutant strains in co-culture.
These objectives will be achieved by employing a combination of molecular genetic, genomic, and
biochemical approaches to dissect the mid locus, and transcriptional profiling of donor and recipient
strains in coculture to determine the transcriptional responses to kin recognition and DCT. Together,
these studies will elucidate the molecular basis of kin recognition in mycobacteria and provide further
mechanistic insights on this novel mechanism of HGT.

functional impairment and suicide risk (MBCT-S/P). We will examine the feasibility of the study design and ask
participants if the found the treatment to be acceptable. We expect this smaller study will provide critical
information for a larger trial.
 Suicide is the 10th leading cause of death. Chronic pain is a leading cause of functional impairment in the
United States and is a risk factor of suicide even after accounting for psychiatric disorders. Veterans are a
vulnerable population for both suicide and chronic pain; however, there is little research examining ways to
reduce functional impairment and suicide risk in a combined treatment. Therefore, this proposal examines the
use of MBCT as a novel way to simultaneously address functional impairment and suicide risk. Research on
patients at risk of suicide and on patients experiencing chronic pain supports the utility of MBCT separately.
However, there is limited evidence investigating a combined treatment that addresses both functional
impairment and suicide risk. Application of MBCT on veterans at risk for suicide who are experiencing
functionally-impairing chronic pain provides a unique opportunity to simultaneously address these interactive
factors.
 The overall goal of the broader program is to enhance functioning and to reduce veteran suicide, and the
proposed project will provide data to guide the development of a larger trial. The objectives of the current
proposal are to (1) combine existing MBCT intervention protocols to develop an MBCT manual aimed at
addressing the unique needs of veterans experiencing functional impairment from chronic pain who are at risk
for suicide, (2) examine if the recruitment, retention, and treatment delivery is feasible and if MBCT-S/P
acceptable to participants, and (3) assess parameters of key outcomes among participants randomized to
receive MBCT-S/P versus an Education control to inform a subsequent larger clinical trial.
 To achieve these objectives, we will develop a manual through an evidence-based, iterative process then
conduct a randomized clinical trial in Veterans with chronic pain reporting suicidal ideation. We will randomize
a total of 76 participants to receive either MBCT-S/P or Education. We will assess pain and suicide risk
outcomes such as suicidal ideation, depression, and interpersonal factors at baseline and after the treatment
period. We will also track participant flow, therapist adherence to the manual, participant homework completion
and participant satisfaction with the treatment.

While vaccines are an integral component of disease management, vaccine technologies remain inadequate for
addressing malaria. Malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum remains a global public health concern, with
more than 229 million cases and 409,000 malaria-related deaths annually. The spread of drug-resistant parasites
and insecticide-resistant mosquitoes has exacerbated the problem of controlling malaria in many developing
countries in recent years. Current control measures such as bed nets, diagnostics, and drug treatment are
helpful, however, together with more effective vaccines that reduce infection and transmission, cases of
severe malaria may be eliminated. While an RTS,S virus-like particle vaccine targeting the sporozoite stage
of P. falciparum is available, it remains only 30% protective in children that receive the vaccine, leaving children
highly vulnerable. Versatope aims to address the unmet need for an effective malaria vaccine by
leveraging their powerful, flexible, and thermostable vaccine adjuvant platform. The power of the
technology platform is based on molecular engineering of recombinant outer membrane vesicles (rOMVs)
derived from a probiotic E. coli Nissle 1917 strain (BSL-1) engineered with a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and
reduced endotoxicity. The resulting rOMVs are nano-sized particles that not only display foreign antigens of
interest but also serve as potent adjuvants for long-term immunological memory and the induction of neutralizing
and effector antibodies that protect against lethal pathogen challenge. rOMVs are stable under refrigerated
conditions and can also be lyophilized and formulated for increased stability at room temperature, facilitating
worldwide deployment. Using this platform, Versatope aims to deliver a malaria vaccine that acts as both a pre-
erythrocytic and transmission blocking vaccine, protecting against both infection and transmission. The
anticipated result of this Direct to Phase II proposal is selection and advancement of a malaria vaccine candidate
that prevents liver-stage infection and reduces mosquito-borne-transmission. The success of Versatope’s
malaria vaccine would represent a breakthrough in malaria reduction worldwide as an improved pre-erythrocytic
vaccine(s) with substantially improved properties over the pre-erythrocytic RTS,S vaccine currently in use.
Specifically, Versatope’s malaria vaccine would feature improved efficacy, longevity of immunity, reduced
number of vaccinations, thermostability, and a lower cost of goods. The new pre-erythrocytic rOMV vaccine will
target 70% efficacy in preventing new infections in infants and children. Together with a 70% reduction in
infections provided by bed nets, this could reduce the R by a factor 10. The combined reduction in
transmission of malaria provided by the pre-erythrocytic vaccine and current control measures (bed nets,
access to health care, early diagnosis, and chemotherapeutic treatment) may not only allow global health
programs to eliminate malaria from low transmission areas but may provide the potential for global
eradication. This non-clinical development and toxicology program will advance the readiness of Versatope’s
malaria vaccine for clinical evaluation and implementation in malaria endemic regions.

Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is the third leading cause of death worldwide at 3.23 million
(2019), while nearly 400 million suffer its effects. COPD is a heterogeneous, multi-phenotypic disease with lung
damage derived from smoking, vaping, cooking, forest fires, pollution, chemical exposure, and numerous
occupational hazards (e.g., 1st responders, military, agricultural and industrial workers). The most common form
of COPD is chronic bronchitis, which is associated with mucus hypersecretion that results in greatly reduced
lung function leading to a decreased quality of life.
Current treatments for COPD largely treat symptoms without meaningfully altering the course of the disease.
There are currently no truly disease-modifying treatments available for COPD patients. Different families
of proteases have been implicated in COPD. Recently, a specific protease has been shown to be upregulated
in lung epithelial cells and macrophages, and its expression in these cells correlates directly with disease severity
in human COPD patients. The target is a pleiotropic membrane bound protein that processes cytokines, growth
factors, receptors, and receptor ligands on the cell surface. Verra Therapeutics has developed a soluble protein
inhibitor, VTH245, that selectively inhibits the proteolytic activity and blocks deleterious activities in models of
COPD. This innovative protein inhibitor has significant advantages in specificity (compared to small molecule
inhibitors), penetration (smaller than monoclonal antibodies), and immunogenicity (based on a naturally
occurring protein sequence). Data generated in our Phase I project have demonstrated that VTH245 treatment
in a gold-standard mouse model of cigarette smoke-induced COPD 1) significantly reduced biomarkers of lung
inflammation and destruction; 2) reduced inflammatory cell counts in the lung lavage to near-air levels; and 3)
reduced mucus hypersecretion. Further, these results matched or exceeded performance of the marketed drug,
roflumilast. While roflumilast treatment is commonly associated with a range of toxicities that limit its use, VTH245
was well tolerated and displayed the highest survival rate over 6-months (20/20 animals). This Phase II SBIR
project will extend our findings from Phase I and provide key IND-enabling safety data to inform future first-in-
human studies through the execution of the following Specific Aims: Aim 1: To identify the preferred route of
administration for VTH245 for treating COPD by comparing the efficacy provided by two clinically relevant
routes of administration, subcutaneous and inhaled, determining a single route for use in toxicity studies in Aim
3; Aim 2: To perform critical CMC activities for VTH245 process development and generate high quality
VT245 for use in toxicity evaluations in Aim 3; and Aim 3: To generate a preliminary safety profile of VTH245
to support IND approval. Successful completion of the Phase II program will further define the target product
profile for VTH245 and provide critical data for an IND submission to support a clinical development program.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
The molecular chaperone Heat Shock Protein-90 (Hsp90) is essential for the folding and
activity of an array of `client' proteins involved in signal transduction pathways. They are
also responsible for many maladies including cancer, neurodegenerative, autoimmune
and inflammatory diseases. Hsp90 inhibition strategies are currently being explored in
these diseases in pre-clinical studies and clinical trials, however the optimal use of
Hsp90-targeted therapeutics remains unknown. This is partly due to our limited
knowledge of Hsp90 regulation in cells. Unraveling the detailed regulatory mechanisms
of Hsp90 function in cells can provide new strategies to increase the cellular potency of
Hsp90 inhibitors. Hsp90 chaperone function is coupled to its ATPase activity, which is
regulated by co-chaperones and posttranslational modifications (PTMs). However, it is
unclear how these regulatory components work together to fine tune Hsp90 function and
also contribute towards drug sensitivity. During the past five years we have made major
contributions towards the understanding of Hsp90 regulation by co-chaperones and
PTMs. i) New co-chaperones: We have identified three new co-chaperones, FNIP1, 2
(collectively FNIPs) and Tsc1, that decelerate the chaperone cycle and facilitate chaper-
oning of both kinase and non-kinase clients. They are regulated by PTMs (phosphoryla-
tion, O-GlcNAcylation, SUMOlyation and ubiquitination). Their expression also enhances
Hsp90 binding to drugs and consequently sensitizes cells to Hsp90 inhibitors. ii) Post-
translational modification of Hsp90: Our work during the past decade on Hsp90 PTMs
has redefined the regulation of its chaperone activity and revealed the reciprocal regula-
tory mechanisms between client proteins, co-chaperones, and Hsp90. We have recently
shown that loss of TSC1 co-chaperone leads to hypoacetylation of Hsp90 and elevated
its ATPase activity. It also subsequently decreased Hsp90 binding to its inhibitors. Our
long-term goal is to unravel the molecular mechanism of Hsp90 chaperone regulation in
cells and regulatory factors enhancing cellular potency of Hsp90 inhibitors. Our strategy
is to use biochemical, biophysical and cell-based assays to decipher the interconnectivi-
ty and compensatory mechanisms between the co-chaperones and PTMs. Our vision is
to utilize this information to dissect the intricate network of regulatory signals involved in
fine tuning Hsp90 function and their impact towards cellular sensitivity to Hsp90 inhibi-
tors.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Basement membranes (BMs) are non-cellular protein layers that simultaneously provide
parenchymal cell-attachment sites and also barriers between tissue compartments. The inner
limiting membrane (ILM) is a special BM that prevents movement into the retina from the
vitreous as such it is a formidable barrier to intravitreal viral-mediated gene transfer or stem cell
transplantation. Current methods to circumvent the ILM involve its physical or enzymatic
removal with limited effectiveness. The consequence has been that successful cell- and gene-
based therapies have targeted a subretinal approach, an effective approach for the outer retina,
but of extremely limited use for the inner retina. The goal of this exploratory project is to
manipulate the molecular structure of the ILM to promote integration of neural stem cells or viral
transfection. ILM formation is dependent on the deposition of laminins, particularly those
containing the β2 subunit. We propose two different manipulations of the laminin polymer
forming the backbone of the ILM: one, genetic and a second, employs a small biomolecule to
disrupt the laminin polymer.
 Our first approach will be to remove genetically a key component of the ILM, Lamb2. Our
prior studies show this disrupts the sheet-like nature of the ILM. We will test if this molecular
rearrangement of the ILM renders these retinae more permeant to cell and virus entry. Second
approach will be to disrupt laminin polymerizing; netrins, small matrix molecules with laminin
homology, are known to disrupt laminin polymerization during normal development and in
experimental conditions. We will produce netrin-induced focal disruptions of the ILM and assay
for facilitated gene and cell integration.
 We will perform our experiments, in vitro using organotypic cultures of retina as well as in
vivo murine models. The in vitro approach has the advantage that we can add back laminin and
reconstitute the ILM and thereby proving that laminin manipulation is the key step. The in vivo
approach is more clinically relevant. While in this exploratory project, we will use murine models
future successor applications could employ more clinically relevant animal models.
 Together, the experiments in this project will assess the barrier that the ILM presents to
biologic-based engraftment therapies. They will determine if specifically disrupting the laminin
backbone is enough to promote engraftment. These experiments if successful will provide a
powerful tool to promote advanced matrix-based approach to manipulation of retinal BMs to
promote gene-based and cell-based therapeutics in the inner retinal disease.

Suicide is the fifth leading cause of death among U.S. children 5 to 12 years, yet limited research on childhood
suicide and suicidal behavior (SB) exists. The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) has acknowledged
this critical gap as a high research priority. A significant risk factor for the early onset of a first suicide attempt
(SA) is a parental history of SB. Although the familial transmission of SB is well documented, research
examining the specific mechanisms associated with familial risk is limited. Our ongoing NIMH-R21 study
(Cohort 1) is investigating factors related to the familial risk of SB in children, 6-9 years, with (PH+; n=100) and
without (PH-; n=100) a parental history of SA. This proposed R01 study will continue annual follow-ups for
Cohort 1 and add an additional 300 newly enrolled families (Cohort 2; ages 9-11 years; 150 per PH group) for
a total sample of 500 parent-child dyads. Youth will be followed for four years from mid/late-childhood through
early/mid-adolescence. Using the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) framework, we will examine the
trajectories of neurocognitive function (NF), emotional reactivity/regulation (ERR), non-suicidal self-injury
(NSSI), suicidal ideation (SI), and SA in PH+ and PH- youth along with contributions by sex and race. Study
participants at first assessment include youth 7-12 years. At last assessment, youth ages will range from 10-15
years. Both groups, PH+ and PH-, will be balanced by sex and race. Two main research aims and one
exploratory aim will be tested. Aim 1: Examine longitudinally how PH status is associated with trajectories of
NF and ERR constructs measured during mid/late-childhood through early/mid-adolescence. Aim 2:
Investigate the potential mediating role of NF and ERR constructs on the association between PH status and
offspring NSSI, SI, and SA. Exploratory Aim: Test sex and race as potential moderators of ERR and NF
trajectories, and on the association between PH status and offspring NSSI, SI, and SA. This proposal’s central
hypotheses are that (1) PH+ status increases vulnerability for developmental trajectories characterized by NF
deficits and emotional dysfunction/dysregulation; (2) these trajectories will mediate the association between PH
status and youth NSSI, SI, and SA; and (3) these associations between trajectories and SB/NSSI will be
moderated by both sex and race. The hypotheses are informed by preliminary findings from the ongoing NIMH-
R21 study, where group differences were found for ERR, SB, and NF. The proposed R01 study aligns well with
the NIMH 2020 Strategic Plan for Research with emphasis on Goal 2-investigating mental health trajectories
and inclusion of diverse samples. Completing the proposed study will assist with the identification of specific
mechanisms associated with the familial risk of SB, determine if sex and race moderate the associations
between risks and youth SB, and provide direction for targeted prevention strategies for high-risk youth.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：SUMMARY
 Early childhood caries (ECC) is the most common chronic childhood disease. Although largely
preventable, ECC affects one third of socioeconomically disadvantaged and racial/ethnic minority preschool
children in the US. Effectively reducing ECC disparity requires a better understanding of its biological factors
from birth to early childhood including identifying differential exposure to risk factors by race and socioeconomic
status. While ECC is an infectious disease initiated by the oral microbiota (bacteria and fungi), the interplay
between host, environment, and oral microbiota affects the onset and severity of ECC. However, to date, few
studies have examined the early-life longitudinal development of oral microbiota in underserved children, and
none have utilized comprehensive methods to examine multiplatform (host and environmental) factors that
contribute to the establishment of cariogenic microflora and onset of ECC among the underserved children.
 Oral Microbiome in Early Infancy (OMEI) study will address this urgent need to understand
biological factors related to ECC among underserved racial/ethnic minority groups. The OMEI leverages
a recently archived birth cohort that compromises 160 low-income minority infants (primarily Black/African
American) and a comprehensive collection of medical/oral health records and ~1760 salivary/supragingival
samples (obtained via NIDCR KL2TR001999 and K23DE027412, PI: Xiao). The OMEI builds upon our previous
work that 1) revealed racial background is associated with early-life oral microbiome development in the context
of ECC; 2) demonstrated oral bacterial-fungal cross-kingdom interactions and their associations with ECC; 3)
identified human genes related to Host-S. mutans-Dental caries interactions; and 4) developed machine-learning
prediction models for ECC. In Aim 1, we will use metagenomic analysis to define the critical assembly and
functional development of the oral microbiome (bacteria and fungi) in early infancy (birth to two years) among all
infants and their respective racial groups. In Aim 2, we will use computational modeling to identify determinants
(maternal, genetic, and immune factors) of infants’ oral microbiome development. In Aim 3, we will use high-
dimensional statistical machine learning approaches to integrate multi-platform (maternal, microbial, genetic,
immune, and environmental) data to identify biological factors underlying ECC etiopathogenesis and develop
ECC prediction models. The OMEI will be the first study that examines the early-life biological factors underlying
ECC disparity from an infants’ oral microbiome perspective. Risk factors revealed from OMEI could be used as
targets for ECC early prediction and prevention specifically suitable for underserved children. An integrated
health disparities research team with investigators from multiple disciplines (microbiome, perinatal oral health,
metagenomic sequencing, high-dimensional biostatistics, genetics, and health disparities), together with an
outstanding internal-external advisory committee, will ensure the success of the proposed OMEI project.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
The foveola, the 1-deg retinal region where cones are most densely packed, is of paramount importance for vision.
Damage to this tiny portion of the retina has devastating consequences for many daily activities as humans use it
to resolve fine details in the visual scene. Yet, primarily as a consequence of technical challenges, little is known
about the mechanisms of foveal vision. A major difficulty in studying foveal functions comes from the need to
finely control retinal stimulation. At this scale, both placing and maintaining a stimulus at a desired eccentricity is
difficult, because of uncertainty in localizing the center of gaze, and because of the continual retinal motion caused
by fixational eye movements, the slow eye drifts and small saccades (microsccades) that humans continually
perform. Recent technical developments offer complementary strengths for overcoming these challenges: high-
resolution retinal imaging allows for high-precision eye-tracking and gaze-contingent retinal stimulation while at
the same time imaging the central fovea, yet it poses limitations in how psychophysical testing is conducted and
makes it challenging to run high volume of subjects/trials. On the other hand, high-precision video eye-tracking
coupled with gaze-contingent display control provides a flexible way for testing vision at the fine grain of the
foveola and acquire large volume of data, but it does not provide information on foveal anatomy. To overcome
these limitations this research uses a unique blend of these cutting-edge techniques for flexibly mapping visual
functions and attention at the fine scale and linking oculomotor behavior, visual perception and anatomy in the
foveola. The overarching goal of this research is to determine the limits and constraints of foveal vision and the
mechanisms the visuomotor system relies on to compensate for these limitations, and to optimize fine spatial
vision. Foveal vision will be investigated from three different perspectives: how eye movements and retinal
anatomy jointly shape fine spatial vision in the foveola (Aim 1), how oculomotor plasticity and attention contribute
to fine spatial vision in the foveola (Aim 2), how attention and the interplay with peripheral vision constrain the
temporal dynamics of foveal processing (Aim 3). By bridging anatomy, oculomotor behavior and visual acuity, the
research in Aim 1 will examine the fine modulations of visual acuity and cone density across the central fovea,
how ocular drift varies in relation to cone density and whether the location chosen as the preferred retinal locus
has an impact on acuity. Research in Aim 2 will examine the plasticity of microsaccades and how fine control of
attention acts at spatial frequencies near the resolution limit and to compensate for anisotropies in sensitivity in
the central fovea. Research in Aim 3 will elucidate how the temporal dynamics of vision and attention change
foveally and extrafoveally and how sensitivity to co-occurring foveal and extrafoveal stimuli is modulated during
fixation. The outcomes of this research may raise the possibility that fine control of attention and fixational eye
movements can counteract vision loss within the central fovea in the early stages of certain diseases, and they
may open the way for visual rehabilitation procedures acting on the fine control of eye movements and attention.

The University of Rochester (UR) and Duke University will establish a Translational Center for Barrier MPS
(TRaCe-bMPS) to create drug development tools (DDTs) focused on the role of barrier functions in disease,
injury, and infection. The overall goal of the Center is to submit full qualification packages to the FDA for five
DDTs relevant to the treatment of: 1) central nervous system (CNS) disorders, 2) fibrosis, 3) musculoskeletal
autoimmune disease, 4) sepsis, and 5) osteomyelitis. For each DDT we have assembled an experienced and
multidisciplinary team to establish reproducibility of biomarker assessments for clinically important contexts of
use (CoU). Each DDT will be based on an existing, validated MPS model and leverage the modular µSiM
MPS platform which provides design flexibility along with translationally relevant permeability and imaging at
the interface between tissue compartments.
The TRaCe-bMPS will comprise: 1) a Qualification Program (QP), 2) a Resource Core (RC), and 3) an
Administrative Core (AC). These units will work together to achieve the Center’s five-year mission while
establishing sustainability through commercialization, collaboration, and resource sharing. The QP will
develop DDTs and standard operating procedures (SOPs) and achieve answer-in-sample-out functionality
through live cell imaging and integrated sensor technologies. Reproducibility for each DDT will be established
in at least two laboratories. Qualification plans and packages will be submitted to the FDA in a collaboration
between regulatory scientists at UR and Duke. Working with manufacturers, the RC will qualify every DDT
component before distribution to development teams. The RC will also advance DDTs to arrayed formats that
are compatible with automated plate readers and liquid handlers. The AC will include an Executive Committee
that will direct the Center with input from stakeholders, including pharmaceutical companies who will define
end user needs. The AC will also manage formal reporting and other interactions with the NIH, FDA, and the
NCATS center hub.
The dysregulated transport of cells and molecules between tissues is the underlying cause of many diseases
and is applicable to the development of drug programs. Additionally, the delivery of drugs to affected tissues
depends on the ability to cross these barriers. Despite the fundamental significance of tissue barriers in
medicine, most microphysiological systems (MPS) do not provide reliable access to quantitative assessments
cellular and molecular exchanges at tissue barriers. By focusing on DDTs specially designed to provide these
metrics, the TRaCe-bMPS addresses an unmet need in drug development. This focus, along with the unique
technologies that enable it, will also make the TRaCe-bMPS a unique and valuable contributor to the
forthcoming TRaCe-MPS network.

Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is the second most common adult muscular dystrophy in the
world with a global prevalence of ~4:100,000. Clinically, patients with FSHD experience progressive
weakness, muscle wasting, and varied symptomatic burden. As adult patients with FSHD age, they frequently
develop difficulty walking or lose the ability to ambulate due to profound weakness and muscle atrophy.
Currently, there are no therapies that have been demonstrated to reverse or even slow the progressive
symptoms associated with FSHD. A treatment that limits disease progression and/or reverses functional
decline would be beneficial to this population. In 2022, we successfully completed a single center (University
of Rochester), single-arm, proof-of-concept study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of daily rHGH
(Genotropin®) combined with testosterone enanthate injections every 2 weeks in men with FSHD. Participants
received study drugs for 24 weeks followed by a 12-week washout period. Participants received serial safety
testing, laboratory testing, functional assessments, and disease burden monitoring during the study with no
participants experiencing a serious adverse event. After 24 weeks, the six-minute walk distance increased by
37.3 meters (p=0.001), lean body mass improved by 2.2 kg (p<0.0001), body fat reduced by 1.3 kg (p=0.044),
overall strength (standardized QMT, average % of predicted normal) increased by 3% (p=0.033), clinical
function (FSHD-COM) improved by 12% (2.4 points; p=0.006), and total disease burden (FSHD-HI) reduced by
19% (6 points; p=0.043) from baseline. While this approach generated one of the largest gains of function in
response to a therapy in FSHD, a larger placebo-controlled efficacy study is needed to further validate these
results. The proposed one-year planning award allows for the completion of all of the preliminary steps
needed to successfully initiate and eventually conduct such a study. Planning award activities will include but
will not be limited to: 1) finalizing the study protocol, statistical analysis plan, data and safety monitoring plan,
and all required study materials; 2) securing pharmaceutical contracts for study drugs; 3) identifying and
securing partnerships with external collaborators and clinical sites; 3) initiating the IRB approval process; and,
4) applying for a NIAMS U01 clinical trial award to support the implementation and conduct of a multicenter
phase 3 study. Ultimately, this phase 3 study will evaluate an extremely promising therapeutic approach for
improving ambulation, strength, lean body mass, and symptomatic burden in a well-defined cohort of patients
with FSHD and will pave the way for FDA approval of a potentially life-improving therapy for patients with this
muscular dystrophy.

 Chemosensation plays a critical role in social behavior among humans and mammals. Olfaction, a form of
chemosensation, is essential for various social behaviors, including maternal behavior and predator detection.
For terrestrial mammals, social interaction is heavily reliant on chemosensory information processed by the
accessory olfactory system (AOS), which is specialized for detecting non-volatile odorants, such as kairomones
(interspecific social cues) and pheromones (conspecific social cues). In the AOS, the initial processing of
chemosensory information takes place in the vomeronasal organ (VNO), where natural AOS ligands activate
vomeronasal sensory neurons (VSNs) through the expression of vomeronasal receptors (VRs). Despite
extensive research, many unknowns exist regarding the natural AOS ligand-receptor pairs, elicited behavior,
and the downstream neural circuitries. My preliminary data revealed that various types of molecules, such as
bile acids, dipeptides, and fatty acids, had distinct levels of abundance in the feces of mouse-fed snakes
compared with those from insect-fed lizards and salad-fed turtles. In addition, the AOS was selectively activated
by fecal extracts from reptiles fed different diets. To explore how mice respond to snake fecal chemosignals, I
developed a layered, hybrid machine learning (ML)-based behavior analysis workflow. This workflow revealed
that snake feces increased risk assessment behaviors in mice that were distinct from other threatening odors,
such as 2,4,5-Trimethylthiazole (TMT). Based on these preliminary data and analytic tools, this proposal seeks
to identify the chemosensory mechanism and associated behaviors elicited by threatening chemosignals from
the snake, a known mouse predator. To do this, I will use liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) to
determine the natural fecal ligands that activate VSNs. Then, I will implement volumetric VNO Ca2+ imaging via
objective-coupled planar illumination (OCPI) microscopy to identify responsive VSN populations to natural fecal
ligands. I will also leverage novel ML-based analytic workflow to comprehensively quantify mouse behavior from
2D/3D video monitoring as animals respond to fecal chemosignals from predatory species. Furthermore, I will
employ whole-brain serial two-photon tomography (STPT) imaging to determine brain-wide activity patterns
elicited by threatening predatory chemosignals. Collectively, this proposal will significantly advance the field by
(1) identifying new kairomone ligands, (2) broadening the range of analytical techniques for studying
chemosensory behavior, and (3) deepening our understanding of chemosensory information processing along
the behaviorally relevant AOS pathway. The successful completion of the proposed experiments will provide a
strong foundation for a R01 grant, including uncovering AOS ligand-receptor interactions at the single-cell level
(Aim 1), examining associated behaviors in high resolution (Aim 2), and exploring the activity patterns triggered
on a brain-wide scale (Aim 3).

Microglia are immune cells that act as the primary rst-responding sentinels in the brain. In response to brain
injury, infection, or disease, microglia rapidly react to attack intruders, remove neuronal debris, and restore home-
ostasis. In addition to their immune role, microglia have been shown to be critical to normal brain development
and function. Although direct comparisons between morphology and function are hard to make, it is clear that
changes in microglial morphology correspond to di erent responses to external stimuli and internal functional
states. Reactive microglia undergo a series of stereotyped morphological changes that grossly correspond to their
di erent immune functions. Additionally, it has been shown that microglial morphology is altered with neuronal
activity, demonstrating that changes in their physiological functions are tied to distinct morphologies, even in the
absence of pathology. Analysis of alterations in microglial morphology can inform studies of neurodevelopment,
neurodegenerative diseases, and the e ects of environmental toxicants on brain function; however, currently we
are unable to ascribed speci c functions to morphological states. Improved methods of processing and analysis
have the potential to remove this critical barrier and allow us to directly link morphological changes with their
corresponding functional consequences.
 Confocal microscopy is used to capture digital images at the spatial resolution necessary to detect the morphol-
ogy of individual microglia. These images are often processed using proprietary commercial software to extract
individual cells. The morphology of these cells is then quantifying using Sholl Analysis, in which concentric circles
are overlaid on the image and the number of microglial branches that intersect the circle at each distance from
the soma are counted. The resulting curves are subsequently analyzed to obtain summary statistics, such as the
maximum number of intersections observed. The majority of these summaries ignore the dependence between
adjacent distances and lack a corresponding measure of uncertainty. Furthermore, current methods discard a
vast amount of information present in both the Sholl curves and, to an even greater degree, in the digital images
themselves. Finally, individual quantitative summaries are typically analyzed separately, ignoring the dependence
between di erent aspects of microglial morphology and thereby reducing statistical power.
 We propose to develop statistical methods to model microglial morphology that fully leverage the wealth
of information present in the imaging data and provide interpretable parameter estimates and corresponding
measures of uncertainty. The overall goal of the proposed research is to develop statistical methodology that will
lead to improved analysis of microglial images and uncover the changes in morphology that are most predictive of
alterations in microglial function.

 Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a last resort procedure for patients with acute heart or lung
failure. The procedure carries signiﬁcant risk of brain injury, yet no brain monitoring is performed, partly due to
signiﬁcant risks of current neuroimaging technologies. Thus, the cause of these injuries, their relation with ECMO
settings, and how they can be prevented are unknown. A critical need exists for non-invasive techniques to mon-
itor brain physiology at the bedside for ECMO patients and for strategies to minimize brain injury. Our objective
is to develop a means to ﬁnd predictors of neurologic functional outcome based on severity of injury assessment
in ECMO patients that can potentially lead to individualized optimization of extracorporeal support and timely
neuroprotective interventions. To this end, we have carefully selected multi-modal monitoring techniques that
can quantify cerebral autoregulation, neurovascular coupling, and neuronal health. To probe cerebral autoreg-
ulation based on microvascular blood ﬂow, diffuse correlation spectroscopy (DCS) will be used. Near-infrared
spectroscopy (NIRS) will provide blood oxygenation and volume information. Electroencephalogram (EEG) will
measure cortical electrical activity continuously, and evoked potentials (EPs) will measure the functionality of
subcortical nuclei in the brainstem and midbrain. We hypothesize that this combination will enable prediction of
functional outcome in patients undergoing ECMO. Furthermore, simultaneous measurements of hemodynamic
and electrophysiological parameters will provide a unique opportunity to investigate disruption of neurovascu-
lar coupling as an additional marker for brain injury. In Aim 1, we will construct several prediction models for
functional outcome based on multi-modal neuromonitoring parameters from ECMO patients and evaluate their
capabilities. In Aim 2, we will investigate whether our inter-hemispheric asymmetry measure of cerebral au-
toregulation, developed during preliminary studies, is a unique marker for ECMO by comparing patients with and
without ECMO treatment. In Aim 3, we will construct a new low-cost optical system and carefully validate against
established DCS and NIRS system. The new system will enable continuous monitoring for future multi-center
trials and multi-regional measurements.
 Successful completion of these aims will result in great advances in ECMO and neurology research by provid-
ing a comprehensive innovative non-invasive longitudinal monitoring tool. In terms of ECMO, this work lays the
foundation for using this tool to optimize ECMO settings and reduce the occurrence of brain injuries in critically-ill
patients. Broadly, this multi-modal tool can be used to understand how the brain functions in diseased states in
order to discover treatments to prevent and treat neurologic disorders.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
 People born preterm are at risk for developing pulmonary hypertension (PH) and heart failure that will
profoundly shorten their lifespan. This is an emerging epidemic of growing concern because conservative
estimates suggest there are 4 million survivors of preterm birth living in the United States, 40% of which have
subclinical PH. The risk of developing disease is highest in adults born extremely preterm and thus directly
associated with their need for supplemental oxygen (hyperoxia) at birth. But how hyperoxia at birth triggers
disease, and whether PH and heart failure are integrated or separate diseases is not known. We propose to fill
this gap in knowledge using lungs of preterm infants, adults who were born preterm, and an established mouse
model wherein hyperoxia between postnatal days (PND) 0-4 causes PH via three distinct stages. The first or
priming stage occurs when the lung is exposed to hyperoxia. During this time, hyperoxia stimulates endothelial
expression of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) responsible for producing the vasoconstrictive peptide
angiotensin (Ang) II and driving PH when uncontrolled. Hyperoxia also suppresses proliferation of
cardiomyocytes lining the pulmonary vein and extending into the left atrium, resulting in left atrial dilation and
insufficient filling of the left ventricle. This is followed by a latency period where ACE and Ang II levels continue
to increase even though the lung is no longer in hyperoxia and the loss of atrial cardiomyocytes causes
progressive diastolic dysfunction. The third or disease stage is characterized by high NADPH oxidase (NOX) 3
in pericytes, vascular remodeling and congestion, and mortality. The high expression of NOX3 in pericytes was
unexpected and may explain why hyperoxia causes post-capillary remodeling, thus distinguishing it from
pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) where smooth muscle cells express NOX4. Building off these findings,
we hypothesize neonatal hyperoxia stimulates expression of ACE in pulmonary endothelial cells, which
persists and increases because of ongoing endothelial injury and diastolic dysfunction, and causes PH
when it dysregulates Ang II and NOX3 later in life. We will determine how hyperoxia regulates ACE in
pulmonary endothelial cells (Aim 1), how NOX3 contributes to vascular remodeling (Aim 2), and whether
suppressing ACE/Ang II signaling effectively reduces PH and diastolic dysfunction caused by hyperoxia (Aim 3).
Understanding how hyperoxia causes cardiovascular disease could advance new concepts on how to best
manage it in people born preterm.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Glutathione-S-transferase μ-1 (GSTM1) belongs to the superfamily of GSTs that are phase II antioxidant
enzymes and are regulated by nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2). Homozygous carriers of the
GSTM1 null allele, GSTM1(0), are deficient of the enzyme and activity. GSTM1(0) is associated with increased
risks of cancer and cardiovascular diseases (CVD). We discovered that GSTM1(0) is associated with more rapid
CKD progression in the African American Study of Kidney Disease (AASK) trial participants, independent of and
is additive to the effect of the Apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1) high-risk variants. This association has been replicated
in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study, and in multiple other populations. While the upstream
regulation of GSTM1 has been defined, its downstream effect is poorly understood. Our preliminary data suggest
that GSTM1 modulates the balance of hydrogen sulfide (H2S), a gaseous molecule that is an end product of the
transsulfuration pathway (TSP) and has emerged as an important regulator of cell metabolism and signaling.
 We reported that global Gstm1 knockout (KO) mice have increased renal oxidative stress, inflammation and
kidney disease in angiotensin II-induced hypertension (Ang II-HTN) and the remnant model of CKD. The
mechanism(s) by which deficiency of the ubiquitous GSTM1 enzyme exaggerates renal oxidative stress,
inflammation and injury is unknown. Bone marrow cross-transplantation implicated GSTM1 deficiency in the
parenchyma rather than bone marrow derived cells drive renal inflammation. Through metabolic profiling, we
have strong preliminary data suggesting that GSTM1 modulates the TSP that is critical in maintaining optimal
cellular function. Compared to control mice, Gstm1 KO mice have 3-4 fold higher renal levels of the TSP
intermediate metabolite cystathionine and significantly decreased levels of H2S, a bioactive end product of the
TSP that could be a factor that can explain the phenotypes observed in GSTM1 deficient humans and mice.
Moreover, loss of GSTM1 downregulates the activity of cystathionine y-lyase enzyme that generates H2S in the
TSP. In AASK, compared to those with GSTM1 active allele, homozygous GSTM1(0) participants with high
serum levels of cystathionine were ~ 2 times more likely to have a doubling of serum creatinine or ESRD. Our
survival analysis suggests the impact of GSTM1 on the composite outcome in AASK is determined by levels of
urinary sulfate, an end product of H2S. We hypothesize that loss of GSTM1 results in lower TSP activity with
deleterious impact on CKD states. We will: 1) Test the GSTM1- TSP- H2S axis in Ang II-HTN and CKD models;
2) Test whether GSTM1 informs the vascular-immune and renal epithelial-immune interface effects on renal
oxidative stress, inflammation and injury, and dysregulated TSP pathway; and 3) Determine whether H2S levels
segregate with GSTM1 genotype and clinical outcomes in CKD Stages 2-5; and leverage our randomized double
blind placebo-controlled trial as an external validation of the relationship of H2S and GSTM1, and to test whether
sulforaphane, a stimulator of Nrf2, can increase H2S levels in CKD patients in a GSTM1 dependent manner.

 Chemosensory systems contribute extensively to social behavior in humans and other mammals,
including mice, a predominant animal model for diseases and disorders that impact human social
function. We propose to study the neural circuitry of the accessory olfactory system in order to better
understand how this system extracts information from chemical messages and informs social
behavior. Without improved understanding of these processes, we risk making mistakes in the
interpretation of studies seeking new therapies for diseases and disorders involving social behavior.
 The activity of excitatory projection neurons called mitral cells (MCs) in the first neural circuit in the
accessory olfactory system, called the accessory olfactory bulb (AOB), strongly influences
reproductive physiology and social behavior. AOB mitral cell activity is tightly controlled by several
types of GABAergic interneurons: juxtaglomerular cells, external granule cells, and internal granule
cells (IGCs). We and others have identified that AOB IGCs undergo experience-dependent plasticity
following chemosensory social behaviors. We will investigate the hypothesis that these cells, and
perhaps other AOB interneurons, are involved in social behavior plasticity.
 We will use multiple physiological techniques to investigate cellular and synaptic physiology in
AOB interneurons that undergo experience-dependent plasticity. We will investigate how experience-
dependent plasticity modulates interneuron excitability, morphology, and gene transcription. We will
determine how interneuron plasticity influences MC chemosensory tuning in vivo and ex vivo using
chemogenetics, optogenetics, and live calcium imaging. Finally, we will investigate the impacts of
inhibitory plasticity on brain-wide patterns of neuronal activation and social behavior during repeated
social encounters. Combined, these studies will fill major gaps in our understanding of chemosensory
information processing, experience-dependent plasticity, and mammalian social behavior.

tissue using high resolution two photon microscopy (TPM) and utilize it to shed new mechanistic insights about
the myofibroblast microenvironment in fibrovascular peritendinous adhesions. Advances to our understanding of
the cellular and molecular events involved in tendon adhesion using transgenic mouse models, which could lead
to disease modifying therapies, are often hindered by reliance on 2D histology sections and single-cell analysis
techniques, neither of which can put cellular interactions or molecular processes into their 3D spatial context.
Alternatively, microscopy techniques such as TPM and light sheet microscopy (LSM) can provide spatial context,
but struggle to simultaneously provide the throughput, contrast and resolution required to map the cellular
processes involved in tissue healing over physiologically relevant spatial and resolution scales and so are not
widely used in tendon biology. To overcome these limitations, we have developed protocols for immunolabeling
and tissue clearing of tendon injury models and demonstrated molecular and second harmonic generation
(SHG) imaging of tendon in situ. Our proposed advances in detection electronics and imaging enable two
photon microscopy two orders of magnitude faster than conventional microscopes and multicolor imaging
at rates comparable to or exceeding LSM. Finally, we propose a novel approach to MV deconvolution, which
simultaneously acquires multiple angular views to decrease focal volumes by an order of magnitude, enabling
isotropic resolution tomographic imaging of tissues. We combine these technical advances into a high
throughput platform for 3D spatial immunophenotyping and proteomics and then apply it to understanding the
complex mosaic of vascular and inflammatory cells, extracellular matrix (ECM), and signaling (TGF-
β1/mTOR) in the myofibroblast microenvironment, to shed new mechanistic insights that could lead to discovery
of cellular and molecular targets for biologic therapies. The aims for this proposal are: Aim 1 will develop a new
approach to tomography using MVD based on simultaneously imaging two angular views that will accelerate
imaging and reduce the extreme computational complexity required to fuse two sequentially acquired volumes
together. Eight channel acquisition will enable dense spectral multiplexing of probes and a deconvolution,
enabling efficient quantification of spatial relationships between reporters at sub-wavelength scale. Aim 2 will
apply MV-TPM to tomographically profile the myofibroblast microenvironment to build spatial cellular interaction
networks of innate and adaptive immune cells within the vascular inflammatory microenvironment of
myofibroblasts. Aim 3 will utilize MV-TPM imaging to map TGF-β1/mTOR signaling in the myofibroblast
microenvironment and subsequently inhibit it to validate its role in adhesions. When completed, the proposed
work will develop a high throughput 3D spatial immunophenotyping and proteomics imaging platform to shed
novel mechanistic insights and discover new biologic therapies.

cells, which is critical for limiting infection. This proposal focuses on two opposing aspects of this anti-viral
state: one, cytokine-induced metabolic reprogramming, which we find is essential for the ability of cytokines to
limit viral infection; and two, the Human Cytomegalovirus (HCMV) UL26 protein, which we find is a major
antagonist of anti-viral gene expression. HCMV is a major cause of congenital birth defects and causes severe
disease in several immunosuppressed patient populations. Our results indicate that the anti-viral cytokine
TNFα induces glycolytic activation, which is essential for its anti-HCMV activity. However, the mechanisms
involved are not clear. We propose to identify the mechanisms through which anti-viral cytokines induce
metabolic remodeling (Aim 1), and determine how cytokine-induced metabolic activities limit HCMV infection
(Aim 2). Finally, we will determine how the HCMV UL26 protein blocks anti-viral responses, which we
hypothesize involves modulation of the activity of an intrinsic immune transcription factor complex (Aim 3). The
proposed research will identify novel cellular and viral mechanisms that govern the success of HCMV infection.
These mechanisms represent key determinants that could potentially be targeted to limit virally-associated
pathogenesis.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Although new treatments have improved outcomes in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), disability remains
high, most patients have ongoing disease activity, and lasting remissions are rare. A major gap
in the field is the elusive identity of pathogenic cells driving persistent inflammation and bone
erosion. Our lab focuses on the identification of pathogenic B cell subsets in RA, which might
drive persistent and aggressive disease. We reported that B cells promote bone erosion by
RANKL/TNF-mediated differentiation of monocytes to osteoclasts (OCs) and TNF/CCL3-
mediated inhibition of osteoblasts (OBs). Importantly, synovial B cells express much higher levels
of these bone pathogenic factors. More recently, we identified a subset of B cells expressing the
classic T cell lineage defining transcription factor T-bet enriched in the RA synovium and
correlating with disease severity and the abundance of SLAMF7 pro-inflammatory monocytes.
We find that synovial T-bet B cells express cytokines influencing OCs/OBs, SLAMF7, and the T-
bet inducible chemokine receptor CXCR3. Remarkably, mouse B cells lacking T-bet did not
activate OCs or inhibit OBs. Based on our results, the central goal of this proposal is to define
how T-bet influences synovial B cell states, mediates B cell-driven bone effects on OCs/OBs, and
coordinates B cell pathogenic functions in RA target tissue, contributing to joint erosion and
synovial inflammation. We hypothesize that T-bet promotes pathogenic B cell functions in the RA
synovium via acquisition of a pro-inflammatory cytokine/chemokine program that orchestrates
CXCR3-dependent B cell migration to the synovium and enhances SLAMF7-dependent
monocyte activation and bone erosion. We will use deeply characterized RA patient cohorts, high-
resolution single cell transcriptomic and spatial analysis of joint target tissue, and novel animal
models to track T bet B cells and selectively and conditionally delete T-bet in B cells of mice with
collagen induced arthritis. The combination of preclinical and translational studies will facilitate
the mechanistic interrogation of T-bet B cell functions in RA via 3 SAs: 1) Determine the
mechanisms by which B cell T-bet promotes RA joint erosion; 2) Assess how T-bet B cells impact
RA synovial monocyte activation; 3) Examine the role of T-bet in B cells during inflammatory-
erosive arthritis in mice. By detailing the functional impact of T-bet B cells, innovative treatments
targeting their activity may be a novel path towards preventing bone erosion and conferring lasting
clinical remissions.

freshwater. Climate change is impacting the Lakes, altering water temperature, pH, storm frequency, ice cover,
and precipitation. Human debris, including plastic, also impacts the Lakes and those who rely on it. Plastic enters
the Lakes as microplastic (MP; particles <5 mm) or as macrodebris that may degrade to MP. There are significant
knowledge gaps about the cycle of plastic in the Lakes, but MPs have been found in all lake habitats, throughout
the food chain, and in tap water. The potential human health effects of Lake-associated exposure to MP are
vastly understudied. How MP inputs and impacts will be affected by climate change is also unknown. Addressing
such complex problems requires engaging diverse community partners and a multidisciplinary systems science
approach. The over-arching goal of the Lake Ontario Center for Microplastics and Human Health in a Changing
Environment is to prevent negative human health impacts of MP in the context of climate change in the Great Lakes
by engaging diverse partners in research, promoting environmental health literacy, and promoting solutions.
Because the Lake Ontario region is representative of the Great Lakes basin, our work will be broadly transferable.
Our innovative approach assesses plastics as they exist in the environment: as mixtures of post-consumer plastic
polymers, degraded by the environment, and covered with biofilm. A major challenge of MP research is
standardization of materials and methods, which we address with a novel Materials and Metrology Core that
supports and is integral to all 3 research projects. Project 1 will holistically assess projected climate
change impacts on plastic input, degradation, ecotoxicity, and microorganisms in plastic-associated biofilms.
Project 1 culminates in modeling to predict future input, fate and transport of microplastics in Lake Ontario.
Project 2 will build on Project 1’s foundation to assess the potential for dermal and lung exposure to MPs by
leveraging nanomembrane technologies to analyze mammalian cytotoxicity and bioactivity of natural and
experimental particle mixtures in combination with variation in temperature and availability of metals and
persistent organic pollutants. Project 3 extends the investigation to the whole organism by using the
amphibian Xenopus to rigorously assess the biodistribution of MPs and impacts on development, fitness,
immune homeostasis and antiviral immunity, under varied conditions of temperature. Given the high degree of
evolutionary conservation of vertebrate physiology, the outcomes from this study are very relevant to human
health. Our Community Engagement Core involves diverse partners in all aspects of the Center, including
community science, direct action, development and dissemination of materials, and building partners’ capacity
to promote solutions. Our Administrative Core coordinates across two institutions (the University of Rochester
and the Rochester Institute of Technology), supports multidirectional communication with external stakeholders,
oversees our Plan for Enhancing Diverse Perspectives, and evaluates progress toward Center goals.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：ABSTRACT
The exon junction complex (EJC) is deposited by the spliceosome upstream of exon–exon junctions during the
process of pre-mRNA splicing. If an exon–exon is sufficiently downstream of either a normal termination codon
or a premature termination codon (the latter of which can be generated by splicing errors or frameshift or
nonsense mutations), then EJC-dependent nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) is triggered. NMD destroys
aberrant mRNAs and regulates the normal gene expression of ~5-10% of unmutated mRNAs. I recently
discovered that AKT, a central cell signaling kinase, is a constituent of an alternative EJC containing CASC3
(the AKT EJC) but not UPF2 or RNPS1 (in the canonical UPF2 EJC). AKT functionally replaces UPF2 in UPF2-
independent NMD by activating the key NMD factor UPF1. AKT does so by phosphorylating UPF1; UPF2 does
so by binding UPF1. I found that insulin-mediated activation of AKT signaling increases AKT EJCs at the expense
of UPF2 EJCs, which is the first example of cell-signaling mediated regulation of EJC composition. These
findings are important because AKT signaling and NMD, which converge at the EJC, are both dysregulated in
some cancers, Fragile X syndrome, and type 1 and 2 diabetes. Despite its importance, there are many remaining
uncertainties about how EJCs are formed, including: when and how the commitment to either the AKT EJC or
UPF2 EJC is made; the mechanism by which insulin increases AKT EJC formation; if insulin increases and/or
alters EJC binding at exon−exon junctions; if spliceosomes are involved in alternative EJC formation; the
choreography of steps involved in core EJC formation, presumably on the spliceosome; and how EJCs are
transferred to upstream of exon−exon junctions on newly spliced mRNA, to name a few. In this proposal, I will
start addressing some of these uncertainties while receiving training in concepts and techniques from my
mentoring team so as to continue pursuing these questions in my own lab. In Aim 1 (K99), I will test (i) the
precursor-product relationship between UPF2 EJCs and AKT EJCs (while learning how to generate and use
HEK293T cells engineered for auxin-induced degradation of EJC proteins), (ii) if the insulin-promoted increase
in AKT EJCs and decrease in UPF2 EJCs requires splicing, and (iii) if insulin signaling increases and/or alters
the number of EJC-bound exon–exon junctions (while learning RIP-Seq). In Aim 2 (K99), I will identify and define
any insulin-promoted post-translational modifications (PTMs) on EJC proteins that promote the increase in AKT
EJCs and decrease in UPF2 EJCs (while learning mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics and PTM
profiling). In Aim 3 (R00), I will apply my background in mechanistic biochemistry and training in new techniques
to build an independent research program aimed at elucidating yet-undetermined molecular mechanisms in EJC
biology, starting by defining which splicing factors are needed for core EJC assembly, which splicing factors, if
any, are involved in alternative EJC formation, and for the latter, whether PTMs of splicing factors are involved.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a frequent complication among critically ill children and is independently associated
with increased morbidity and mortality. While AKI identification remains largely reactive, early prediction of AKI
provides opportunities for mitigation strategies to improve patient outcomes. Existing pediatric AKI risk
prediction models are primarily driven by single-center data with limited translation into clinical decision support
(CDS) at the point of care. While CDS systems are designed to improve care quality and patient safety, they
have failed to make meaningful improvements while contributing substantially to provider alert fatigue. This is
especially true in pediatric critical care, where alerts and alarms are ubiquitous and often ignored. Disregarding
important alerts may lead to patient harm. The addition of machine learning methods to augment decision
support has been the focus of substantial hype, however clinicians remain skeptical over concerns such as
utility, credibility, and validity. Within this clinical context, this application addresses two specific knowledge
gaps. First, without validated and generalizable prediction tools, the best method for identifying patients at risk
for developing AKI in the pediatric ICU (PICU) is unknown. Second, current CDS systems are burdensome and
there exist no clear recommendations on useful, usable implementations for AKI decision support. The long-
term goal of my research program is to improve the care and outcomes of critically ill children with acute kidney
injury while reducing provider alert frustration through personalized, shareable CDS. As a step toward this
goal, this career development award will demonstrate success of an integrated CDS pipeline for external
validation, cutting-edge technology to facilitate distributed implementation, and usability assessment. The
research aims of this proposal are to: 1) establish baseline external validity of an existing AKI prediction model
and extend with new predictors to improve accuracy within two novel multi-center datasets, each with >80,000
PICU encounters; 2) overcome interoperability barriers using Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resource
(FHIR)-based EHR technology and prospectively evaluate this implementation’s performance; and 3)
implement principles of user-centered design to improve clinician acceptance. With the support of my
mentoring committee, I will gain advanced knowledge and develop expertise in user-centered design,
qualitative methodology, clinical trial design, and implementation science in decision support. This work is
innovative as it leverages two brand-new, highly granular datasets to achieve external validation, implements
an AKI prediction tool using new FHIR-based technology, and utilizes mixed-methods cognitive informatics
tools to perform usability testing. However, the truly innovative aspect of this work is the integration of all three
aims into a single pipeline. This work provides the foundation for a prospective clinical trial evaluating clinical
effectiveness, as well as incorporation of biomarkers and physiologic data streams, and the development of
evaluation measures for decision support systems.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Abstract: Transcription is one of the first steps in gene expression, and the many protein factors involved must
be tightly regulated to correctly carry out cellular processes. The Integrator complex, a 15-subunit metazoan-
specific complex, was initially discovered to be crucial for the proper transcription of certain non-coding RNAs.
Recently, it has been found that Integrator is a broad transcriptional regulator with roles at many protein-coding
and non-coding genes. Integrator acts as a negative regulator of RNA Polymerase II (RNAPII) transcription
through promoter-proximal termination and can alter its functionality in response to stress, such as DNA damage
or reactive oxygen species. Despite its critical role in fine-tuning transcriptional regulation, it is not yet understood
how Integrator is assembled and regulated, presenting a knowledge gap in the field.
 Our preliminary experiments strikingly revealed that a key factor involved in DNA damage repair (DDR)
associates with a global regulator of RNAPII activity, thus providing a previously unknown connection between
these two processes. Specifically, the BRCA1-ATM activator 1 (BRAT1) associates with Integrator subunit 11
(INTS11), the endonuclease-containing subunit within the Integrator complex. BRAT1 is a cytoplasmic protein
that re-localizes to the nucleus upon DNA damage to act as a scaffold between the site of damage and repair
proteins. Our cryo-EM analysis of the INTS11-BRAT1 heterodimer reveals that BRAT1 forms a circular structure
around INTS11 and uses three conserved C-terminal residues to bind to the INTS11 active site, preventing its
cleavage of RNA. Additionally, the cryo-EM analysis showed that INTS9 can bind to form an INTS11-INTS9-
BRAT1 heterotrimer, suggesting interplay between BRAT1 as an inhibitor of INTS11 and other members of the
Integrator complex. The goal of this proposal is to examine the function and mechanism of action of these two
unique complexes. To examine the function, our lab generated BRAT1 null cell lines and a rapid depletion system
using the auxin-inducible degron (AID) tag to allow quick depletion of INTS11. Initial studies of these lines show
that BRAT1 loss results in an INTS11 depletion phenotype, presenting upregulation of genes negatively
regulated by Integrator. Overall, these data present a model where BRAT1 could regulate Integrator activity
through its association with INTS9/11. The hypothesis is that BRAT1 acts as a licensing factor, facilitating the
assembly of the Integrator complex and providing precise regulation, which is especially important during cellular
stress such as DNA damage. To test this hypothesis, three aims are proposed. First, the interaction between
BRAT1 and INTS9/11 will be biochemically defined to further probe the structure. Next, the impact of BRAT1 on
the canonical Integrator complex function will be determined. Finally, the impact of INTS11-INTS9-BRAT1 during
DNA damage repair will be elucidated. Successful completion of these aims will provide a more thorough
understanding of the regulation and assembly of the Integrator complex.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：The APOE-ε4 (APOE4) variant is the greatest single risk factor for developing late-onset Alzheimer's disease  (AD); however, its involvement in AD is poorly understood. Recently DAB1 was identified as the only genome-wide significant locus in homozygous APOE4 (e4/e4) individuals in the UK Biobank. DAB1's involvement in AD  was profoundly dependent on the e4/e4 genotype and also the DAB1 SNP zygosity, which influenced the  probability of developing AD and the age of onset. Based on this, we hypothesize that there is a genetic  interaction between APOE4 and DAB1 that synergistically augments the likelihood of AD. Both APOE4 and  DAB1 act on the endocytosis-signaling receptors in the APOE-receptor family and have consequences for Aβ  accumulation and microtubule binding protein τ (MAPT) phosphorylation pointing to potential functional  overlap. DAB1 is an obligate adaptor protein on the REELIN signaling pathway that is well characterized for its  roles in brain development. The Reln gene has been shown to impact AD-related phenotypes in mouse models  of the disease, and in the APOE4 study RELN was nominally associated with AD in e4/e4 individuals pointing  to a broader involvement of the RELN-DAB1 pathway in AD. We propose that determining the Dab1 dosage-dependent, AD-related phenotypes that are exaggerated by APOE4 in mouse and culture models will help elucidate how these genes contribute to the increased risk of the disease. We will investigate this by pursuing  the following specific aims: Specific Aim 1. To determine if Dab1 heterozygosity alters early and/or late AD-like pathology in an APOE variant-dependent manner. Specific Aim 2. To determine if Dab1-gene dose influences APOE4-dependent endocytic aberrations. Our long  term goal is to resolve how DAB1 and other  REELIN pathway genes influence APOE4 biology as a means to understand how this apolipoprotein and  defects in endocytosis contribute to the progression of AD.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
 The ability of the brain to utilize information from past experiences to guide future decisions, termed adaptive
behavior, is critical for survival. To effectively adapt behaviors, the brain applies stored memory to new but similar
situations (generalization), while also maintaining the capacity to distinguish unique stimuli (discrimination).
When these critical processes (memory generalization or discrimination) go awry, it can lead to maladaptive
disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and panic disorder. Despite their importance,
mechanisms underlying memory discrimination and generalization remain largely unknown. This proposal will
investigate the dynamic processes that underlie the utilization of an encoded memory to guide future behaviors,
in particular the molecular, synaptic, and circuit mechanisms that govern the balance between discrimination
and generalization. We have collected very exciting preliminary data showing that individual contextual fear
memories are represented in the dentate gyrus (DG) by multiple functionally distinct neuronal ensembles defined
by different activity-dependent transcriptional pathways, and that these ensembles bi-directionally regulate the
discrimination-generalization balance. Based on these exciting findings, we hypothesize that the activity-
dependent pathways target specific synaptic inputs on DG granule cells to differentially control memory
discrimination and generalization. We aim to (1) uncover novel forms of learning-induced synaptic plasticity; (2)
reveal underlying circuit mechanisms for memory discrimination and generalization; and (3) identify the
molecular players important for this experience-dependent behavioral adaptation. The proposed research is both
conceptually and technically innovative. It will experimentally demonstrate for the first time functionally distinct
active neuronal ensembles coexisting within the memory engram, shed light on the synaptic and circuit
mechanisms by which encoded memories directly drive experience-dependent behavioral outputs, and may lead
to new treatment strategies for neuropsychiatric disorders, such as PTSD and panic disorder, which are caused
by the imbalance between memory discrimination and generalization.

This proposal represents a highly innovative line of research focused on understanding the mechanism/s
by which PHF21B (plant homeodomain finger protein 21B) deficiency impairs social memory. Social
impairments, which may be present in multiple psychiatric disorders, are characterized by deficiencies in
social functioning. Social cognitive impairments are a central feature of several neurodegenerative,
neuropsychiatric, and neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism spectrum and attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder. They also frequently occur following acute brain damage after traumatic brain injury
and stroke. We present conceptually novel evidence showing that PHF21B deficiency significantly impairs
social memory. In the three-chamber social interaction test, the social preference index of the PHF21B
deficient mice did not significantly differ, but they spent more time interacting with the new stranger than
with the familiar stranger compared to wild-type mice. Therefore, their social novelty index was
significantly greater than wild-type animals, suggesting social memory deficits. Social memory
impairments were further confirmed using the 5-trial social memory test. Our new data also support the
concept that PHF21B binds to the epigenetic marker tri-methylated Lys36 at histone H3 (H3K36me3), a
histone marker associated with expressed gene bodies and recruits proteins implicated in transcription,
splicing, and DNA repair. The proposed studies will interrogate the specific role(s) of PHF21B in neuronal
function relevant to social behaviors, specifically in social recognition impairment. Expected outcomes are
to characterize the role of PHF21B in the hippocampus and identify its target genes and regulatory
mechanisms relevant to social memory. We expect that the proposed studies will provide novel insights
into the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying epigenetic changes that affect social recognition
memory. The results to be generated by this project have translational potential as they may facilitate the
development of novel pharmacological targets for social memory deficits.

 Psychiatric geneticists have discovered hundreds of common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
associated with schizophrenia (SCZ) through genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Brain expression
quantitative trait loci (eQTL) can successfully explain some of those genetic associations. Differences in genetic
association between disparate ancestral populations are often reported, however, it is not known whether such
population differences originate from different underlying risk genes or from different allele frequencies and linkage
disequilibrium of the same risk genes. Our central hypothesis is that genetic regulation of gene expression
within brains, as represented by eQTL, can explain the disease GWAS signals. Population structure
influences eQTL as it influences GWAS. The major assumption is that the biological foundation of GWAS and
eQTL is the S-E-D relationship, short for SNP-Gene Expression-Disorder. Functional interpretation of GWAS signals
relies on the discovery of S-E-D relationships. Due to a lack of brain transcriptome data from populations of non-
European descent, interpreting SCZ GWAS results for variants uncommon in other populations presents a
significant challenge. To discover the causes of these population differences, we will develop a transcriptome
dataset of a new brain collection from East Asians (EA, N = 578) combined with samples from the existing
PsychENCODE project (EA, N = 18). We will also use data of individuals of African ancestry (AFR, N = 411) from
the PsychENCODE projects. Along with data from those of European descent (EU), which dominates the
PsychENCODE (N =1,321) projects, we will have brain transcription data of three major populations in the world.
Our specific aims include: 1) to relate SNPs to gene expression (the S-E portion of the S-E-D networks), we will
develop and compare eQTL and coexpression networks of postmortem brains from three populations, EA, AFR and
EU; 2) to connect SNP-expression to SCZ GWAS signals (the S-E-D aspect), we will use brain eQTL data to
explain SCZ GWAS of EA, EU and AFR populations and to identify SCZ risk loci that also serve as regulators of
brain gene expression; 3) to develop a novel cross-population predixcan algorithm that can infer genetically
regulated gene expression, and identify those differentially expressed in patients. The algorithm will be used
to re-analyze existing PGC SCZ data, and use Vanderbilt University data to replicate the findings. This study will
improve the understanding of the genetic contribution of population diversity to SCZ risk. It is critical for developing
more precise diagnoses and treatments for the benefit of diverse populations, for addressing health disparity.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Project Summary: Most genetic variants associated with disease in genome-wide association studies (GWAS)
lie in non-coding gene regulatory elements (GRE; e.g., promoters and enhancers). GREs are tissue- and cell
type-specific and are identified through their epigenomic signatures, including low DNA methylation (DNAm),
DNA accessibility and certain histone modifications. The PsychENCODE Consortium has characterized brain
GREs across brain regions and developmental time points, as well as in the brains of psychiatric patients using
mostly DNA accessibility and histone modification marks. These marks, however, identify large regions of
enrichment (~300-2,000bp), providing only low resolution coverage of the important regulatory nucleotides, e.g.,
transcription factor binding sites. DNAm (especially cell type-specific DNAm) has received less attention,
although it has been linked to psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia (SZ) and bipolar disorder (BD).
 In the adult human brain, ~80% of CG and 1.5% of non-CG (CH) sites are methylated, and can be converted
to hydroxymethylcytosine (hmC) and further demethylated. In postmitotic neuronal genomes, mCH and hmC
accumulate to a significantly higher level than in other tissues--a distinct feature of the brain's epigenome.
Bisulfite sequencing (BS)-based approaches that are used to measure (h)mC can pinpoint GREs with single
base resolution, presenting a unique opportunity to refine the gene regulatory landscape of the brain cell types.
 Here we aim to create reference DNAm maps [mC and hmC, using BS and oxidative (ox)BS sequencing]
and transcriptional profiles (using RNA-seq) in two major subtypes of neurons in the human dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), namely excitatory glutamatergic (Glu) and inhibitory GABA-ergic neurons. The
proposed work is based on fluorescence-activated nuclear sorting (FANS) methods that we recently developed
to separate nuclei of different cell types from autopsied human brain, and on our recent findings that showed
unexpected relationships between DNA(h)m, GREs, and gene expression in the DLPFC Glu and GABA neurons.
 We will perform these studies at key time points of postnatal brain development and adulthood to map
DNA(h)m within active neuron subtype-specific GREs that may be vulnerable to disruption during childhood and
adolescence periods that coincide with the critical processes of brain maturation and circuit refinement (Aim 1).
This work will be complemented with single nucleus mC profiling, which will allow us to define the developmental
trajectories of mC in discrete subpopulations of Glu and GABA neurons (Aim2).
 Finally, we will profile Glu and GABA neurons in 150 autopsied DLPFC samples obtained from controls and
cases of SZ and BD, and will then map neuron subtype-specific gene expression and (hydroxy)methylation
quantitative trait loci (eQTL, mQTLS, hmQTLs) (Aim3). We will integrate QTL, transcriptome, and DNA(h)m data
with the results of SZ and BP GWAS to reveal DNA(h)m and gene expression-mediated causal risk variants and
genes, and to distinguish specific neuronal subtype(s) that are critical in the etiology of these disorders.

Eukaryotic RNA polymerase I (Pol I) transcribes ribosomal RNA, a key component of ribosomes. Pol I transcription
accounts for the majority of the total RNA in cells, and its upregulation in human cells is a hallmark of cancer while
its downregulation is a hallmark of several developmental disorders. Pol I transcription is understudied compared
to transcription by Pol II and even Pol III. Our preliminary work suggests fundamental differences between Pol I
and Pols II and III that are the basis for this proposal. Our broad long-term objectives are to determine the molecular
mechanism of Pol I transcription and how its dysregulation leads to cancer and developmental disorders. There
are major gaps in our understanding of (1) the structural organization and architecture of Pol I transcription
complexes; (2) the mechanism for how Pol I initiation factors interact with rDNA, which encodes ribosomal RNA;
and (3) the molecular function of several key Pol I transcription factors in the activation process. The first rationale
for this work is that determining the mechanism and regulation of Pol I transcription will form the molecular basis
for understanding how Pol I defects lead to human disease. Our central hypothesis is that Pol I factors use a
unique mechanism to carry out transcription and their structure and function is different from the mechanisms
governing Pol II and III transcription. The second rationale is that understanding the Pol I transcription mechanism
at the most basic and fundamental levels will translate to a better understanding of the connection between Pol I
and cancer, leading to new cancer therapeutic strategies. Our proposed research will use a conceptually and
technically innovative cross-organismal and interdisciplinary approach that employs a combination of bioinformatic,
computational, molecular, biochemical, genetic, genomic, proteomic, and structural methods in the yeast and
human cells. Guided by strong preliminary studies, we will test two specific aims: (1) Determine the unique
“coactivator” role of TATA-binding protein (TBP) in Pol I transcription, and (2) Determine the mechanism of Pol I
transcription activation. To accomplish these aims, we will use well-established and complementary approaches
to identify and map novel Pol I interactions in their native context. We will complement these studies with structural
modeling in combination with molecular, genetic, and biochemical functional assays to identify Pol I factor functions
conserved from yeast to humans. The proposed research is significant because it will lead to a detailed description
of the Pol I transcription mechanism and will provide a conceptual framework for understanding the link between
Pol I and human disease. Ultimately, this work will illuminate new avenues for diagnosis, potential interventions,
and the development of therapies targeting these novel protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
Although secreted molecular chaperone heat shock protein 90 (eHSP90) has been implicated in tumor cell
invasion through binding and stabilizing extracellular matrix protease client MMP2, our limited understanding of
the regulatory mechanisms that control the eHSP90 chaperone system is a major drawback for designing
successful HSP90-targeted therapies. Our long-term goal is to develop therapeutic strategies that prevent
tumor cell invasion by targeting the extracellular HSP90 chaperone machinery. Our overall objective is to
elucidate how eHSP90 and its regulators are mechanistically modulated, individually and collectively, and in
the presence of their extracellular inhibitors. Our central hypothesis is that extracellular ATP, and tyrosine
phosphorylation of eHSP90 co-chaperone TIMP2, modulate the chaperoning of client MMP2, and affect
HSP90 binding to extracellular inhibitors. This hypothesis is based on our recent published work and
preliminary studies showing that eHSP90 binds and hydrolyzes ATP, and that co-chaperone TIMP2 enhances
HSP90 binding to ATP and its pharmacologic inhibitors. Our rationale is that by elucidating mechanisms of
eHSP90 chaperone regulation, we will design better therapies for diseases that implicate the eHSP90
machinery. We plan to test our central hypothesis by pursuing the following three specific aims: 1) Investigate
the role of ATPase activity in the regulation of extracellular HSP90 (eHSP90); 2) Determine the impact of
tyrosine phosphorylation of TIMP2 on its co-chaperone function; and 3) Elucidate the role of TIMP2 in
enhancing eHSP90 binding to extracellular inhibitors. Under the first aim, approaches to be used are already
established in PI's laboratory and include purification of intracellular and extracellular HSP90 from human cell
cultures, isothermal calorimetry to determine affinity towards an ATP analog, ATPase assays to measure
ATPase activity, enzyme kinetics to determine proteolytic activity, and in vitro and in vivo protein-protein
interactions in the presence and following depletion of extracellular ATP in genetic knock out cell cultures.
Under the second aim, phosphomimetic or non-phosphorylatable TIMP2 mutants designed in the PI's
laboratory will be used, CRISPR knock out cell lines for c-Src kinase, TIMP2 and MMP2 will be employed for
protein-protein interactions and to determine impact on MMP2 activity. Under the third aim, the role of TIMP2,
non-phosphorylatable and phophomimetic mutants in enhanced binding of eHSP90 to its extracellular
inhibitors will be evaluated in drug binding assays performed in vitro and extracellularly in vivo, using human
cell lines and siRNA technology. The impact of TIMP2, and eHSP90 inhibitors on MMP2 mediated proteolysis
will be evaluated in matrix degradation studies. The research approach is innovative, in the PI's opinion,
because it represents a new and substantive departure from the status quo by shifting focus towards targeting
chaperone-regulated extracellular pathways. The proposed research is significant because, it is expected to
provide insight on the basic extracellular regulatory elements that support mechanisms of tumor cell invasion.

 Rod-mediated vision transitions seamlessly to cone-mediated vision as light levels rise through the
mesopic visual range. Despite the fact that mesopic vision is the major mode of vision for people who spend
most of their time indoors under artificial lighting, there is a glaring lack of knowledge of how rod and cone
photoresponses shape the temporal, spatial, and spectral sensitivities of mesopic vision. For decades it has
been accepted that rods subserve vision in dim scenes, detecting only slow variations in light levels (contrast),
and cones subserve vision in bright scenes when contrast changes rapidly. Our recently published results show
that at indoor (mesopic) light levels, rods drive the visual responses to fast — not slow — temporal variations.
Our findings reveal, for the first time, that adaptation of both rod and cone-driven visual responses underlie the
seamless transition between scotopic and photopic vision over the mesopic range, but we do not understand
how this happens. Therefore, there is a critical need to understand the physiology and functional significance of
rod responses at mesopic, indoor light levels. In this application our objectives are: (i) to determine the adaptation
mechanisms that control the responses of rods to slow and fast light variations in mesopic lights, and (ii) to
determine the behavioral significance of rod-driven visual responses to fast changing scenes in mesopic lights.
Our model is that a hierarchical system of adaptation mechanisms is in place to differentially regulate rod
sensitivity as lights rise through the mesopic range. To test this model we propose two related but independent
aims that investigate the underlying cellular and perceptual mechanisms. These aims are to determine 1) how
rods respond to slow and fast variations in mesopic lights, and 2) the behavioral significance of inner segment
conductances to the adaptation of rod visual responses in mesopic lights. For the first aim we will combine the
power of mouse genetics, electrophysiological recordings, quantitative modeling, and operant behavioral assays
to determine how different phototransduction adaptation mechanisms, including background and bleaching
adaptation, work together to differentially regulate the responses to slow and fast light variations and to overcome
the crippling effects of response compression in mesopic illumination. For the second aim, we will use mice with
rod-specific knockout of voltage-gated conductances that are typically activated at mesopic lights to probe the
functional significance of inner segment conductances to rod-driven responses in mesopic lights. Our expected
outcome is to provide evidence for mechanisms that the visual system uses to encode signal variations in
mesopic lights (Advancement of Basic Knowledge). Knowledge of this mechanisms will open new strategies for
understanding and treating retinal pathological conditions, with implications beyond this particular application
(Innovation for Emerging Therapy).

The objectives of this proposal are to determine the mechanisms of photoreceptor protein
compartmentalization. Retinal photoreceptors are polarized neurons whose major functions,
include receiving and transmitting signals, are compartmentalized into discrete subcellular
domains. Compartmentalization is critical for normal photoreceptor activity and reduced vision or
blindness result from improper segregation of proteins. Despite their importance, the mechanisms
underlying protein compartmentalization in photoreceptors, or any other neuron, remain poorly
understood. Essential for understanding compartmentalization are the biophysical properties of
the photoreceptor cytoplasm, the biophysical properties of the proteins that are destined to be
compartmentalized and the forces that drive accumulation of proteins, against significant
concentration gradients, into the specific compartments. We have uncovered a fundamental
biophysical mechanism that may be central to protein transport and segregation in all electrically
active cells: transport of charged proteins within the electrical field generated by the photoreceptor
neuronal activity. We call this novel mechanism axial dynamic electrophoretic protein
transport (ADEPT). We will use state of the art live cell fluorescence imaging tools developed in
our lab, powerful transgenic and gene editing techniques in Xenopus, and sophisticated
biochemical and cell biological approaches to address the following aims:
Aim 1: Map the axial cytoplasmic electric field, Eax, in rod photoreceptors.
Aim 2: Determine the impact of ADEPT on photoreceptor protein transport and
compartmentalization in living photoreceptors.
Aim 3: Determine the locations and influence of Arrestin interactions on their distributions
and dynamics in living rods and cones.

Disruption of normal glomerular filtration is one of the key causes of end-stage renal disease, leading to the need for renal replacement therapy. Myosin 1e (Myo1e) is a cytoskeletal protein that is highly expressed in the glomerular epithelial cells (podocytes) and is involved in many processes important for podocyte function, such as actin assembly regulation, endocytosis, and regulation of cell adhesion. Mutations in MYO1E are found in patients with chronic kidney disease, highlighting its role in maintaining glomerular filtration barrier. In this project we will examine the role of Myo1e activity in supporting podocyte cytoskeletal organization and normal kidney function and test the hypothesis that activation of Myo1e can help protect podocytes from injury and preserve normal glomerular filtration. In Aim 1 we will analyze how disease-associated mutations affect Myo1e functions and activity using a combination of cell-based and in vitro (biochemical) methods. In Aim 2 we will determine the mechanism of autoinhibition of Myo1e activity. In Aim 3 we will test how Myo1e activity helps maintain podocyte integrity and whether activation of Myo1e will have a protective effect on kidney function.

Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infects the majority of people in the world and can cause serious disease in
immunocompromised patients and neonates. The virus establishes life-long latency in bone marrow cells and
disseminates to peripheral organs in quiescently infected monocytes. Antiviral therapy delays virus replication,
but does not eliminate infected cells. Virus rebound, resistance, and drug toxicity complicate treatment and
create a strong demand for improved therapeutics. We advocate that the suppression of HCMV replication must
be in combination with the killing of infected monocytes. We found that HCMV infection of fibroblasts and
monocytes rapidly stimulated the activity of heat shock factor (HSF) 1, a stress-responsive transcription factor,
in a distinct fashion from canonical activation induced by heat shock (HS). Using a novel tool compound called
DTHIB, which has been validated to selectively inhibit HSF1 activity, we found inhibition of HSF1 with DTHIB
attenuated HCMV lytic replication and stimulated death of latently infected monocytes. These studies provide
the beginnings of a proof-of-concept study that HSF1 antagonists may have the capacity to provide the double
“hit” necessary to suppress HCMV replication and eliminate latently infected myeloid cells in a single drug. Thus,
our central hypothesis is that inhibition of HSF1 with the tool compound DTHIB will limit both infection
and spread within an infected host by concomitantly attenuating HCMV lytic replication in permissive
cell types and eliminating latently infected monocytes. The first aim will continue to evaluate the antiviral
potential of DTHIB as an inhibitor of HCMV lytic replication by examining the drug efficacy on different HCMV
permissive cell types, viral strains, and multiplicities of infection (MOIs). We will also conduct transcriptome (RNA
sequencing) analyses and functional studies using DTHIB to identify genes dependent on HCMV-induced HSF1
activity responsible for promoting lytic replication and the impact of DTHIB on the expression of this HCMV-
induced, HSF1-dependent gene profile. The second aim will continue to assess the ability of DTHIB to stimulate
the death of latently infected monocytes by testing the selective drug toxicity on monocytes infected with different
viral strains and at different MOIs. In conjunction, we will perform translatome (polysomal profiling) analyses and
functional studies using DTHIB to identify HSF1-dependent genes responsible for promoting the survival of
latently infected monocytes. The third aim will assess the in vivo antiviral activity of DTHIB on lytic replication,
viral spread, and pathogenesis using a novel murine transplant model with human skin organ, which can
simultaneously monitor HCMV replication in human tissue as well as monitor monocyte-mediated HCMV spread
to distal sites.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a common pathogen that has infected a majority of the human population. While symptoms of HCMV are generally resolved in immunocompetent individuals, the virus remains for the lifetime within the host as a latent infection is established in the hematopoietic stem cells. HCMV has co- evolved with humans and as such, the virus as adapted to undermine host cell antiviral responses. How HCMV undermines these responses is not fully known. Our research has found that an understudied protein modification, S-nitrosylation, plays a role in how HCMV interacts with the antiviral response. We found that viral proteins critical for efficient lytic replication are post translationally modified with nitric oxide groups and that the resulting modifications alter the viral proteins ability to limit antiviral responses. We propose to mechanistically investigate how these modifications impact HCMV protein functions and to identify the impact of S-nitrosylation on HCMV replication. Completion of the aims above will contribute significantly to our knowledge the regulation of biological functions of critical viral factors as well as identify the mechanism by which viruses weaken host defenses against infection. This work will lay the foundation in identifying novel therapeutic targets for a pathogen that lacks a vaccine or a cure.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease of unknown etiology. The pathogenesis is
partly attributed to compartmentalized oxidative stress inside and outside the immune system. The proposed
studies will focus on a critical gap in knowledge - how metabolic pathways that neutralize oxidative stress control
autoimmunity in SLE. The central hypothesis for this project is based on comprehensive metabolome studies
that have showed a dominant impact of SLE on the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) in lymphocytes of
patients and T cells of lupus-prone mice undergoing lineage polarization; the results of which mimic the
deficiency of transaldolase (TAL), a rate-limiting enzyme of the PPP. Lupus-prone mice exhibit activation of the
mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and mitochondrial oxidative stress in the liver and antiphospholipid
antibody (aPL) production prior to the onset of nephritis. Similar to lupus-prone strains, mice lacking TAL exhibit
mTOR activation and overexpression of NDUFS3, a subunit of complex I in the mitochondrial electron transport
chain (ETC) that triggers the production of reactive oxygen intermediates (ROI) and aPL, both of which respond
to rapamycin treatment. TAL deficiency blocks the glycosylation and secretion of PON1 by the liver. This is
attributed to carbon trapping in the PPP and depletion of UDP-GlcNAc which are also detectable in SLE patients
and mice. Although PON1 loss in the plasma has been connected to aPL production and demonstrated in SLE,
antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), and liver diseases, the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Therefore,
the Specific Aims will test our working hypothesis that TAL inactivation i) elicits cell type-specific carbon
sequestration in the PPP and limits substrates for NADPH and GSH production and metabolism through the
ETC and thus triggers a compensatory accumulation of oxidative stress-generating mitochondria, mTOR
pathway activation and pro-inflammatory lineage skewing in the immune system; and ii) limits the availability of
UDP-GlcNAc for glycosylation and secretion of PON1 by the liver, which in turn trigger aPL production in SLE
and TAL deficiency. Under Aim 1, we will test the hypothesis that TAL-regulated carbon flux through the PPP
causes cell-type specific accumulation of sedoheptulose 7-phosphate, depletion of NADPH and GSH, and
redox-mediated mTOR activation to promote the expansion Th17, Tfh, and DN T cells and constriction of CD8
EMT cells and Tregs in SLE patients. Under Aim 2, we will delineate T-cell intrinsic metabolic checkpoints that
control systemic autoimmunity in lupus-prone mice. Under Aim 3, we will determine the role of hepatocyte-
derived oxidative stress in aPL production, pro-inflammatory lineage skewing in the immune system and lupus
pathogenesis. The proposed research is significant because it will establish new, compartmentally defined
metabolic checkpoints of autoimmunity with broad translational relevance for the pathogenesis and treatment
of SLE. The approach is innovative as it will employ genetic checkpoints of oxidative stress and high-resolution
stable isotope tracing of metabolic pathways to delineate lupus pathogenesis.

Loss of vision has a devastating impact on an individual's quality of life. Most blinding diseases result from loss
of neurons in the retina. A promising strategy to treat sight-threatening diseases, is to harness the regenerative
potential of cells within the retina. Müller glia (MG), possess an extraordinary capacity in lower vertebrates to
regenerate retinal neurons. However, in mammalian retinas, including humans, MG are unable to replace
neurons lost to injury or disease. Recently, we have developed strategies to neurogenically reprogram MG in
adult mice by overexpressing the transcription factor Ascl1 in MG. Remarkably, the treatment of Ascl1
overexpression, combined with NMDA-induced retinal damage and histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibition,
causes MG to regenerate functional neurons in the adult mammalian retina. While this is significant progress
towards realizing the therapeutic potential of MG, only a subset of MG successfully reprogram into neurogenic
progenitors while another subset of MG express genes associated with inflammatory processes. We
hypothesized that the inflammation that accompanies neuronal cell loss restricts the regenerative potential of
MG. Indeed, we recently found that ablation of microglia, the endogenous immune cell of the retina,
dramatically improved MG-mediated retinal regeneration. This finding implicates the neuroimmune system as a
key component of the regenerative response of the mammalian retina. However, little is known about the
neuroimmune interface in retinal repair strategies such as endogenous regeneration. This proposal outlines
studies to better understand the neuroimmune axis during MG-mediated retinal regeneration and to develop
immunomodulation strategies to improve the regenerative capacity of the mammalian retina. The data
generated in this proposal will be foundational to Dr. Todd's ultimate goal of becoming an independent
investigator. During the K99 portion, Dr. Todd will expand his technical and theoretical expertise in
neuroimmunology to accomplish his aims studying immune-glial interactions during retinal regeneration. New
collaborations will be established with investigators in neuroimmunology and further training activities will
prepare Dr. Todd to become a successful investigator in the field. The training portion of this proposal will take
place at the University of Washington, which offers exceptional access to both research equipment and faculty
expertise to assist in the accomplishment of the applicant's goals.

 Mutations in USH2A (usherin) are common causes of autosomal recessive blinding diseases in
non-syndromic retinitis pigmentosa as well as syndromic Usher syndrome type II that manifests
congenital hearing loss as well. There is no effective therapy for these diseases. How usherin
contributes to photoreceptor health is poorly understood. An usherin-deficient animal model that
exhibits severe retinal degeneration as in human patients is essential for understanding the
pathological mechanisms and for development of effective therapies to preserve or restore vision.
This project is aimed at generating an usherin-deficient model that recapitulates the phenotypes found
in human patients.

In this proposal we will address one of the major unanswered questions in vision: the mechanism
of rhodopsin delivery and loading into new photoreceptor discs. This perpetual process is
particularly robust in rods where, for mammals, the daily delivery of 30 million rhodopsins supports
the formation of 80 new discs in each rod. While rhodopsin synthesis and delivery to the rod apical
region has been intensively studied, almost nothing is known about what happens afterward, thus
representing a critical knowledge gap. Roadblocks to under-standing this process include the
complexity of the inner segment-outer segment interface that is below the resolution limit of
fluorescence microscopy and the limitations of prior approaches that relied almost exclusively on
static analyses in fixed tissues. To overcome these roadblocks, we have implemented live-cell 3D
super resolution single particle tracking microscopy (3D-sptPALM) to directly examine the
dynamics of individual rhodopsins within discrete photoreceptor compartments in real time. We
will exploit a key mouse model, the retinal degeneration slow (rds) mouse, which allows us to
intentionally vary the level of outer segment membrane complexity while retaining the
photoreceptor cilium. Our preliminary results show the entry of individual rhodopsins into
photoreceptor cilia, their transport along the cilium and, remarkably, their exit back into the inner
segment, for the very first time.
We will address the following fundamental questions:
Aim 1: How does rhodopsin enter (and exit) the photoreceptor cilium?
Aim 2: How is rhodopsin transported within photoreceptor cilia?
Aim 3: How are rhodopsins loaded into new discs?

I am an academic clinician scientist with a focus on the genetics of respiratory diseases. My overarching career
goal is to make an important contribution to the public health burden of chronic respiratory diseases. I aim to
become an independent investigator with the skill set to utilize integrative ‘omic techniques for the improved
biological understanding and clinical management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The
proposed research combines my prior experience in genetics and transcriptomics with training in genetic
association, transcriptomic analyses, and machine learning, in order to better understand the variability in
COPD genetic risk. The hypothesis of this proposal is that there are genetic variants and transcriptomic
factors that are associated with resilience to COPD. This will be tested by leveraging existing data from
multiple well-phenotyped studies from the NHLBI TransOmics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) program.
Specific Aims: (1) Identify genetic variation associated with resilience to COPD against a background of
elevated genetic risk; (2) Define clinical, imaging, and blood gene-expression features of COPD
resilience; and (3) Predict lung-tissue gene-expression profiles of COPD risk and resilience from blood
gene-expression data. The cutting-edge research plan utilizes innovative methodologies to characterize
genetic and transcriptomic resilience to COPD. It is accompanied by a training plan that will provide me with
the skills to complete the research aims and the experience to transition to an independent research career. I
plan to submit an R01 expanding upon the characterization of genetic and transcriptomic resilience in COPD
by combining multi-omic risk- and resilience-scoring and lung-tissue gene-expression imputation to improve
understanding of the biological mechanisms that contribute to observed clinical heterogeneity in COPD. In
particular, I have four training goals that build upon my existing background in respiratory genetics. (1)
Strengthen my knowledge of biostatistics, statistical genomics, and bioinformatic methods; (2) Expand
my skills in transcriptomic methodologies; (3) Gain experience and expertise in the development and
implementation of machine-learning algorithms; and (4) Further develop my mentoring skills and
understanding of study design. I am supported by a mentoring team with complementary skillsets and
successful mentoring careers, which, together with my experience, training, and substantial preliminary data,
will guarantee the success of this proposal. The findings may pave the way for the development of precision
risk-prediction approaches, while implementing a novel methodology to address one of the most important
challenges in the field today: identification of genetic and transcriptomic resilience to COPD.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Doxorubicin is routinely prescribed in treatment of various cancers because of its extremely high efficacy.
However, its use is severely limited because of its potential to cause irreversible cardiotoxicity. Since cessation
of therapy is not viable in cancer patients, there is a need to explore the molecular mechanisms underlying
cardiotoxicity to accurately identify risk factors as well as therapeutic targets for effective adjuncts. The primary
mechanism by which doxorubicin exerts its cardiotoxic effects is due to preferential accumulation of excess iron
in cardiac mitochondria, which generates cytotoxic free radicals, and disruption of cellular and subcellular iron
utilization. Thus, chelating excess mitochondrial iron can prevent doxorubicin-induced cardiac dysfunction.
Indeed, the only drug approved to treat doxorubicin cardiomyopathy, dexrazoxane, has demonstrated
mitochondrial chelation potential. However, dexrazoxane alters topoisomerases, the enzymes responsible for
DNA replication and doxorubicin’s pharmacological target, which thereby impairs doxorubicin’s anticancer
activity. In addition, dexrazoxane has potential to induce fatal myelosuppression and acute leukemias, which
consequently limit its clinical utility. Cancer survivors who subsequently develop cardiomyopathies have the
worst survivals among all cardiomyopathies, and timely intervention results in a superior clinical outcome in those
survivors treated with cardiotoxic chemotherapy. Thus, there is a major unmet need for mitochondria-specific
iron chelators that do not impede doxorubicin’s antitumor activity. Earlier we have demonstrated that hinokitiol,
a small molecule with high iron binding affinity and cell permeability, corrects abnormal iron buildup across the
membrane caused by genetic deficiency in mitochondrial iron transporters. These findings prompted us to
question if hinokitiol could rescue doxorubicin-induced mitochondrial accumulation of iron. Our pilot study has
indicated a feasibility that hinokitiol corrects mitochondrial iron overload and improves survival in cardiac cells
treated with doxorubicin with no influence on tumor-killing effect of doxorubicin. Thus, we hypothesize that
hinokitiol mobilizes excess iron from the cardiac mitochondria and prevents oxidative damage, thereby reversing
doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy, while preserving doxorubicin’s anticancer activity. The specific aims are
to determine: i) mitochondrial iron export after hinokitiol administration, ii) the cardioprotective effect of hinokitiol
on doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity, and iii) the effect of hinokitiol on the antineoplastic efficacy of doxorubicin
using tumor-bearing mice. Our studies will provide a new therapeutic strategy to reverse abnormal accumulation
of mitochondrial iron and correct doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity without compromising its antineoplastic
effects. If successful, this drug can be safely co-administered with doxorubicin as a rescue factor to improve the
therapeutic index of doxorubicin along with better clinical outcome.

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality, with 19 million deaths globally
in 2020 alone. Central to management of CVDs is deepening our knowledge of physiology and pathology of the
heart. Major barriers to our greater understanding of the heart include its deep location and fast dynamics.
Evidence from invasive coronary angiography indicates that the maximum velocity of cardiac structures is 52.5
mm/s, requiring a scan time of 19.1ms to eliminate motion artifacts. To achieve this temporal resolution with
CT is extremely challenging. There have been substantial gains in CT hardware and software over the last
decades (whole heart, dual-source, dedicated cardiac CT, and various approaches to cardiac motion
compensation with ECG-gating) that have transformed coronary CT angiography into a robust and viable clinical
tool. However, owing to the 140ms temporal resolution of current whole heart CT scanners, diagnosis is still
challenging in patients who have irregular and/or fast heart rates especially in cases of arrhythmias and
tachycardia, which commonly occur in older adults, many of whom exhibit atrial fibrillation.
Here we will apply deep learning to radically improve cardiac CT reconstruction by attaining significantly higher
spatial resolution, lower radiation exposure, and better image quality on both modern and legacy CT hardware.
To improve wide-area-detector cardiac CT performance, we will develop a limited-angle reconstruction algorithm
in the Analytic, Compressive, Iterative, and Deep (ACID) reconstruction framework that integrates a deep
network trained on large data, sparsity-promotion, analytic modeling, and iterative refinement. For the first time,
two of the preeminent advances in signal processing, compressive sensing and deep learning, will be combined
to extract full information from scan data and image priors to freeze the beating heart.
The specific aims H3 are: (1) Hyper Dataset: Projection datasets in the Radon space and the corresponding
ground-truth images without motion artifacts in the image space will be generated in simulation, experiments,
and clinical studies; (2) Hybrid Algorithm: A deep learning network and CS-module will be developed, integrated,
and accelerated within the ACID framework for limited-angle free-breathing cardiac CT reconstruction, which will
be shared on an open-source platform; and (3) Holistic Evaluation: The performance of our reconstruction
software will be characterized, the stability and generalizability will be investigated, and task-based clinical
applications will be demonstrated, including quantification of stenosis severity, aorta dimensions, and motion
artifacts within the clinical setting of individuals with atrial fibrillation, tachycardia, and irregular heart rates.
Completion of this project will yield a free-breathing cardiac CT algorithm with the unprecedented temporal
resolution of 60ms, a 230% improvement over the state-of-the-art, allowing cardiac CT without clinically-relevant
motion artifacts. This represents a major step towards the integration of model-driven and data-driven methods
for CT image reconstruction, with a lasting impact on not only CT but also other tomographic modalities.

Although actin is highly conserved throughout eukarya, the mechanisms used to regulate its assembly and
disassembly vary across phyla. Precisely timed and placed actin assembly orchestrates nearly every cellular
process, including cell migration. While actin-driven cell migration has been defined in some detail in animal
cells, it is unknown if diverse eukaryotic pathogens operate using the same set of rules. This proposal will
address the hypothesis that there are conserved principles of cell migration by investigating Naegleria, which
diverged from the “yeast-to-human” lineage over a billion years ago. Specifically, this work will define the
contributions of the cytoskeleton to cell crawling in the “brain-eating amoeba” Naegleria fowleri: a pathogen
that crawls into and within the brain, causing a deadly form of meningitis for which there are no reliable
treatments. Dr. Velle’s initial postdoctoral research using the commonly-used, non-pathogenic model system
Naegleria gruberi highlights the potential for universal rules of motility; N. gruberi crawls on flat surfaces using
thin, actin- based protrusions assembled by proteins called the Arp2/3 complex. This actin and Arp2/3 based
mechanism is also how animal cells crawl on flat surfaces. However, outside of laboratory conditions, cells
rarely—if ever—crawl on flat, uniform surfaces. Animal cells are well-known to switch to a different mode of
motility when crawling through complex, restrictive environments, but this has not been tested in Naegleria.
Because N. fowleri crawl through narrow channels in the skull and into the brain, despite no known
chemotactic signals, dissecting cell migration in restrictive environments is essential for understanding disease.
Therefore, Aim 1 will determine mechanisms of cell crawling under confinement at the level of cell behavior.
Aim 2 will focus on the actin networks in cells; while the protrusions driving N. gruberi migration on flat surfaces
look similar to those of animal cells, defining the actin architecture using Platinum Replica Electron Microscopy
(PREM) will reveal if the ultrastructure is conserved. This aim will also provide critical training to complement
Dr. Velle’s background in light microscopy. The world expert in PREM, Dr. Svitkina, will provide this training as
a member of the scientific advisory committee. Aim 3 will use biochemistry—a technique the applicant has no
prior training in—to examine the upstream mechanisms of Arp2/3 complex activation. Dr. Velle has recruited
Dr. Bruce Goode, an expert actin biochemist, for this training. Because the leading labs in the field of cell
migration frequently employ both microscopy and in vitro actin biochemistry, the proposed training in PREM
and biochemistry will ensure the applicant is skilled in the techniques required for success. Dr. Velle has also
recruited Dr. Matt Welch, an actin expert, Dr. Meg Titus, who has expertise in actin and amoebae, and Dr. Jim
Morris, an expert in N. fowleri, to her scientific advisory committee to provide scientific and career mentoring.
Collectively, the proposed work will provide the technical training, and career mentorship required to launch Dr.
Velle’s career as an independent investigator with a research program focused on Naegleria’s migration.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
 Wnt signaling is an evolutionarily conserved pathway that regulates several cellular behaviors such as
cell proliferation, survival, differentiation, and migration to promote tissue homeostasis. Of note, the Wg/Wnt
signaling pathway is important for tissue patterning and is often deregulated in epithelial cancers. Secreted Wnt
ligands are distributed in the extracellular space to promote paracrine and long-range signaling in target cells.
These paracrine and long-range functions of Wnts are dependent on extracellular Wnt availability, which in part
is dictated by cell-surface glypican, Dally-like protein (Dlp). In this proposal, I will focus on molecular mechanisms
that dictate Dlp-mediated regulation of Wnt availability and signaling.
 Dlp’s role in regulating Wnt signaling has been described as ‘biphasic’: By continual binding and release,
Dlp simultaneously promotes long-range signaling and restricts paracrine signaling, ensuring proper ligand
availability at both ranges. The Page-McCaw lab established Drosophila germarium, a tissue where oogenesis
occurs, as a model to study mechanisms that define Wnt signaling ranges, and identified a novel Dlp/Mmp2
(Matrix Metalloprotease 2) module that modulates paracrine and long-range Wnt signaling in the germarium.
Specifically, I found that proteolytic cleavage of Dlp by Mmp2 alters its subcellular localization and function to
modulate Wnt availability. Additionally, my preliminary data suggest that Dlp/Mmp2 may regulate Wnt signaling
in epithelial tumors to promote tumor growth. In Aim 1, I will investigate the molecular events that occur
downstream of proteolytic cleavage of Dlp to modulate Wg/Wnt availability and signaling in the germarium and
tumors.
 The extracellular Wnt distribution is tightly linked with its production and secretion. I found that Dlp can
modulate Wg (Wnt-1) production in source cells in the germarium. Wg production in source cells in germaria is
tightly regulated and this regulation is crucial for proper oogenesis. Additionally, I found that Dlp interacts with
non-ligand proteins (a finding that has not been previously reported) that communicate with intracellular
cytoskeletal machinery, potentially to modulate cell adhesion and/or shape. In Aim 2, I will investigate novel
mechanisms of how Dlp regulates Wnt ligand production and long-range Wg distribution to facilitate long-range
Wg signaling. These investigations will uncover previously unappreciated roles of cell-surface glypicans in
regulating Wnt signaling and elucidate novel paradigms of developmental strategies employed in multicellular
organisms to maintain tissue homeostasis.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common sexually transmitted virus in the United States (U.S.). HPV infection is
linked to cancers of the cervix, vulva, vagina, penis, anus, and oropharynx, thus representing a significant public health
concern. The HPV vaccine is the most efficient and cost-effective mechanism for combating HPV infection and its cancer-
related consequences. Nonetheless, HPV vaccination rates for age-eligible adolescents remain suboptimal in the U.S.
Scientific evidence underscores the critical influence of sociocultural and contextual factors on parents’ acceptability and
uptake of the HPV vaccination. Sociocultural values, family expectations, health literacy, beliefs, attitudes, and knowledge
influence parents’ behaviors and decisions, healthcare-seeking and utilization, and health outcomes. Black women are
disproportionally affected by HPV-associated morbidity and mortality, with the second-highest cervical cancer incidence
rate, the second highest after non-Hispanic Whites and the highest cancer mortality rate. However, there is a lack of data
for African ethnic minority subgroups such as Cape Verdeans (CV) in the U.S, an ethnic minority group of mixed West
African and Portuguese roots. The U.S. is home to the largest CV population outside the country of Cape Verde, with an
estimated 265,000 CV immigrants and their descendants living in the U.S. CVs primarily reside (~90%) in Massachusetts
and Rhode Island. Understanding HPV and HPV vaccination knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors (KAB) of specific ethnic
minoritized and immigrant subgroups, such as CV, will make it possible to meet particular subgroup needs and improve
knowledge and practices, thereby improving health status and outcomes by decreasing cancer risk. Though recent research
has shown an increase in HPV uptake, but not necessarily HPV vaccine completion, among minority populations including
African Americans and Blacks, no data exist to show that this is the case for CV adolescents living in the U.S. Also, there
remains a paucity of data regarding HPV knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors of CV parents living in the U.S. Therefore,
the proposed study will focus on Cape Verdeans, a population group currently underrepresented in cancer health disparity
research, and seeks to: 1) explore the KAB regarding HPV and HPV vaccination (intention, hesitancy, barriers, initiation,
and completion) among CV mothers and fathers (Phase 1: Focus Groups); and 2) explore CV parents’ HPV KAB, health
communication, sociocultural factors, their intention to have their sons and daughters undergo HPV vaccination, HPV
vaccine hesitancy, barriers to HPV vaccination, and parent-reported receipt of HPV vaccine or refusal of the vaccine (Phase
2: Survey Administration). The proposed community-engaged research is innovative in that it will: 1) engage CVs, an
understudied ethnic minority and immigrant subpopulation currently underrepresented in HPV research, 2) include fathers
who are under-represented in HPV research, and 3) establish a partnership with Catholic and Protestant churches to further
assist with the important goal of addressing HPV vaccine myths and disseminating accurate HPV vaccine information to
CV communities. Moreover, it will provide a solid basis for the design of future linguistically and culturally tailored
education interventions to promote the HPV vaccine among CVs in the U.S. Moreover, this research will build further
research capacity to engage underserved, minority CV parents in future HPV and cancer prevention interventions.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
Lipomannan (LM) and lipoarabinomannan (LAM) are mycobacterial lipoglycans that are critical for Mycobacte-
rium tuberculosis to establish infection. These lipoglycans are synthesized in the plasma membrane and
trafficked to the cell surface. LM and LAM are widely conserved among mycobacteria, and therefore must also
play a fundamental role in the physiology of both pathogenic and nonpathogenic mycobacterial species. However,
it remains obscure how their biosynthesis is coordinated with other cell envelope biosyntheses and how they
contribute to the integrity of the cell envelope. The long-term goal is to determine the role of lipoglycans in my-
cobacterial physiology and identify vulnerabilities in the process of creating and maintaining the cell envelope
structure. As the next step, the objective of this proposal is to gain fundamental insights into the role of lipogly-
cans in cell envelope integrity in Mycobacterium smegmatis and M. tuberculosis. The central hypothesis is that
LM/LAM biosynthesis, in coordination with peptidoglycan and capsular a-glucan biosyntheses, positively con-
tributes to glycan homeostasis, ensuring the plasticity and integrity of cell surface structure during active growth.
The rationale is that finding vulnerabilities in the regulatory process that coordinates the glycan biosyntheses will
lay the foundation for cell envelope-targeting antimicrobial development. Guided by published and preliminary
data from the applicant’s laboratory, this hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two aims: 1) Identify the role of
LM/LAM biosynthesis in suppressing peptidoglycan degradation; and 2) Determine the role of the capsular layer
in maintaining cell envelope integrity. In the first aim, the hypothesis that the cell shape of a LAM-deficient mutant
deforms due to the weakened cell wall will be tested. The potential molecular mechanism of LAM suppressing
peptidoglycan hydrolases will be examined. In the second aim, the hypothesis that the morphological defect of
the LAM-deficient mutant can be overcome by activating the SenX3-RegX3 two-component system and increas-
ing the production of a-glucan will be examined. The proposed research is innovative because it reveals a new
role of mycobacterial lipoglycans in maintaining glycan homeostasis, and because it combines the synergistic
expertise of the applicant and his collaborators in forward genetics and bioorthogonal metabolic labeling of cell
wall biosynthesis, a substantive departure from the status quo in both concept and execution. The proposed
research is significant because the data obtained here will form the foundation for developing drugs that could
kill M. tuberculosis by targeting a regulatory mechanism of mycobacterial cell envelope homeostasis. Such a
drug may also make the cell envelope more permeable to other antimicrobials.

Breast cancer is a complex and heterogeneous disease where the roles of many prognostic factors, including
androgen receptor (AR) which is an emerging potential prognostic biomarker, remain unclear in its clinical pro-
gression. The Nurses' Health Studies (NHS), which motivated this application, are large prospective cohort
studies conducted to investigate the risk factors for major chronic diseases in women including breast cancer.
The data from the NHS contain invaluable information for breast cancer research such as lifestyle, hormonal,
and genetic risk factors, as well as clinical outcomes such as breast cancer diagnosis, recurrence, and death. In
many epidemiologic studies on breast cancer survival, including the NHS, the hazard ratio (HR), which is esti-
mated based on the proportional hazards (PH) model, has been the most routinely used effect measure despite
its limitations. In the NHS data, the PH assumption in the association between AR expression and breast cancer
survival was found to be violated. The interpretation of HR is challenging and the result is often misleading if the
PH assumption is violated, which makes it difﬁcult to assess AR's prognostic values. Recently, summary metrics
based on the restricted mean survival time (RMST), which is deﬁned as the life expectancy up to a speciﬁc time
point, have attracted substantial attention as useful alternatives to the HR. The RMST has many advantageous
features such as its straightforward interpretation and robustness. Speciﬁcally, we can assess the prognostic
factor's effects in terms of absolute effect, which is clinically more interpretable than the HR, without assuming
PH using the RMST-based regression model. In this project, we propose to develop novel statistical methods
based on RMST to fully utilize the rich data from the NHS and to gain a better understanding of the complex
effect of AR on breast cancer progression and survival. Under Aim 1, we will develop a ﬂexible regression
method based on RMST that estimates the varying covariate effects across a range of time. The proposed
regression method will be used to elucidate the clinical signiﬁcance of AR in survival by different subtypes of
breast cancers. Under Aim 2, we will develop a model-free approach to summarize the bivariate survival
data (i.e., time from an initial event to an intermediate event and from the intermediate event to a failure
event). The metrics developed under Aim 2 will be used to study residual survival after breast cancer recurrence
and facilitate comparisons between groups by AR status for different breast cancer subtypes. These novel sta-
tistical approaches will be applied to data from the NHS to obtain new knowledge about the prognostic values of
AR and potentially lead to better targeted therapies.

Therapy resistance is a major barrier to long term remission in pediatric T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-
ALL). The prognosis for children with relapsed or refractory disease is dismal. Leukemia-initiating cells (L-ICs)
regenerate disease upon transplantation into mice. They also recapitulate the immunophenotypic complexity of
the parent leukemia supporting that, as in normal hematopoiesis, there is a cellular hierarchy among leukemic
cells. Our laboratory has previously demonstrated that the L-IC is a committed thymocyte progenitor and resides
in the leukemic DN3 population, however, only a fraction of DN3 cells can give rise to disease. L-ICs rely on
NOTCH1-induced MYC signaling for survival. Recent studies identified dormant, therapy resistant L-ICs in both
murine models and T-ALL patient samples. The role of cell cycle restriction in L-IC latency is incompletely
understood. In an effort to uncover pathways that govern L-IC function, we performed single cell RNA-
sequencing on thymocytes at varying stages of T-cell leukemogenesis using our transgenic Tal1/Lmo2 model.
This approach identified a dormant DN3 cluster, marked by low Ki67 expression, which is observed in other
murine T-ALL samples. Dormant DN3 cells exhibit high Notch1, but low Myc expression. The transcriptional
signature of these cells shows enrichment of genes previously implicated in leukemia initiation or leukemia stem
cell function. Dormant DN3 cells show enrichment of the non-canonical Wnt receptor Ryk, which is reported to
maintain hematopoietic stem cell self-renewal by limiting proliferation and promoting quiescence. RYK is
overexpressed in primary pediatric T-ALL and in Tal1/Lmo2-induced murine T-ALL compared to healthy thymus.
This indicates that RYK may not be restricted to this rare subpopulation and moreover, there may be a
therapeutic window for RYK inhibition in relapsed T-ALL. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that dormant
DN3 cells are quiescent L-ICs that retain proliferative and differentiative capacity, which permits their therapy
tolerance and subsequent expansion during relapse. This proposal will identify a gene signature of dormant DN3
cells and uncover the potential role of these cells in T-ALL relapse by evaluating their L-IC function and
chemoresistance (Aim 1). Aim 2 will define the non-canonical WNT/RYK signaling network in T-ALL and uncover
the role of these pathways in dormant DN3 cells and L-IC function by testing whether inhibition of RYK reduces
the L-IC frequency of murine and patient T-ALL cells. Collectively, these studies will provide critical insight to T-
ALL heterogeneity and will lay the foundation for development of L-IC targeted therapy for relapsed disease.

 The goal of this K99/R00 proposal is to facilitate Dr. Shaobing Su's transition into the role of independent

and resilience lens and her prior research on mental health and development of vulnerable children, especially
children born to immigrants or migrants. Dr. Su seeks to expand her knowledge of the literature related to child
development and parent-child separation as well as her repertoire of methodological skills, including cultural
adaptation of theories, measures, and interventions for racial and ethnic minorities, qualitative and mixed-
method research, Community Based Participatory Research (CBPR) approaches, and grant writing.
 This CBPR-based exploratory sequential mixed-methods research comprises 3 aims and 3 studies:
 Study 1 (Aim 1) will elucidate the mental health challenges that arise in Chinese American children with a
history of early and prolonged parent-child separation; and identify potential processes that might influence
mental health. Study 1 involves semi-structured interviews with Chinese separated-reunited children (N=48,
aged 12-17) and their parents (N=48 primary caregiver parents).
 Study 2 (Aim 2) will examine mental health disparities and risks and resources between separated-reunited
children and non-separated children; and explore the relationships among separation, risk, and protective
factors at multiple levels, and affected children's mental health outcomes. Study 2 is a quantitative study
among 200 Chinese American separated-reunited children and 200 non-separated children (aged 12-17).
 Study 3 (Aim 3) will identify focal areas and potential “active ingredients” to prioritize as components for
development of a targeted intervention for affected children and families. Study 3 will use mixed-methods
analyses to integrate qualitative (Study 1, Community Advisory Board recorded discussions) and quantitative
findings (Study 2, Boston College seed grant) to seek convergence and divergence as the basis for a model of
change and integrate it into existing family strengthening models for mental health interventions.
 The CBPR-based, mixed-methods research may deepen understanding of the impact of parent-child
separation on child development and effects of multilevel risk and protective factors. Findings may inform
intervention, policy, and practices for separated-reunited Chinese American children as well as other children
affected by other forms of separation (e.g., children in institutional settings, children separated at the border).
This award will support Dr. Su's transition to independent research in parent-child separation and mental
health; and enable her to develop R01 proposals to adapt and evaluate family-strengthening interventions for
affected children or to expand the research to other child cohorts with a longitudinal sequential design.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
Pharmacologically targeting intracellular proteins is a key challenge of modern drug development, requiring
innovation and the development of new technologies. This challenge is made more difficult by the fact that many
protein targets remain beyond the reach of established drug discovery technologies because they lack easy-to-
find and unique binding pockets, possess large, and flat contact areas. Indeed, ~85-90% of the human genome
is considered “undruggable,” encoding proteins that are deemed too challenging to bind with conventional
molecules. Hence, new approaches are needed for drugging intracellular protein targets. To address this unmet
need, this project seeks to develop a new class of computationally-designed mRNA therapeutics that encode
peptide-guided protein degraders, known as ubiquibodies (uAbs), for potent and selective degradation of
historically undruggable targets not addressable by conventional drugs. Specifically, uAbs are modular,
programmable proteins consisting of a genetically engineered fusion between an E3 ubiquitin ligase, linker, and
protein/peptide guide. Following ectopic expression in cells, these heterobifunctional chimeras direct the activity
of an E3 to a protein of interest (POI), leading to polyubiquitination and subsequent degradation of the POI by
the endogenous ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (UPP). The objective of this Phase I STTR is to design
customized uAbs against β-catenin and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (CHOP), two
intracellular transcription factors that hold promise as drug targets for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), alpha-1
antitrypsin deficiency (AATD), and other liver diseases. The hypothesis of this project is that uAbs can be
designed to selectively remove cytosolic/nuclear β-catenin and CHOP, with the potential to inhibit the tumorigenic
and proteotoxic potential, respectively, of these drug targets while also limiting toxicity. The plan to address these
hypotheses includes first leveraging an artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML)-powered platform to
create designer uAbs that selectively degrade cytosolic/nuclear β-catenin and CHOP (Aim 1) and then to develop
and evaluate a lipid nanoparticle (LNP)-based strategy for systemically delivering synthetic uAb-encoding
mRNAs in cultured cells and mice. The best performing mRNA-LNP formulations will then be evaluated in mice
to assess biodistribution, efficiency and duration of target degradation, and biological impacts. Overall, the
proposed studies will demonstrate a new paradigm for drugging the proteome based on computational design
of peptide-guided uAbs, with proof-of-concept studies in this Phase I proposal focused on accelerating the
removal of two key intracellular disease drivers through LNP-mediated delivery of mRNA encoding customized
uAbs. Successful completion of this project will lead to a future Phase II application that will explore the
therapeutic potential of uAbs following systemic delivery of optimized mRNA-LNP formulations in relevant animal
models of HCC and AATD. These studies will serve to advance the development and commercialization of
UbiquiTx’s proprietary therapeutic candidates towards an IND.

A key deliverable of the 4DN consortium consists in the sharing of data that pertains to the integration of chromatin
conformation capture (3C) information with the 3-dimensional physical mapping in nuclear space of the corresponding
sequences by multiplexed FISH imaging experiments. To facilitate this integration, the 4DN Imaging Working Group
(IWG) and the Data Coordination and Integration Center (DCIC)1 have developed a data format and metadata annotation
specifications that allows standardized data exchange for multiplexed FISH/FISH Omics datasets2,3. This community
standard is called 4DN FISH Omics Format (FOF) for Ball-and-Stick Chromatin Tracing (FOF basCT)3 and allows the
exchange of processed results deriving from various imaging techniques for basCT4,5,6,7,8–10,11. The release of FOF basCT
in early 20213 has resulted in the deposition to the 4DN Data Portal of over 70 multiplexed FISH datasets2, adoption
of the format by public repositories12, 13–16, and the development of downstream processing and visualization
pipelines17–19.
Despite these advances, the production of formatted datasets and their upload to the 4DN Data Portal imposes a significant
curation and management burden, negatively impacting productivity. With this supplement, we propose to address this
challenge and significantly improve the efficiency of data exchange. This will be achieved by developing automated FISH
Omics data deposition and sharing pipelines that scientists can use both in 4DN and outside 4DN.
1. We will develop a data format and standardized annotation specifications to describe the results of volumetric Chromatin
 Tracing (vCT) FISH Omics experiments. These specifications will be built specifically to extend the already available
 FOF-basCT, be applicable to technologies such as OligoSTORM, and Oligo DNA-based Point Accumulation for
 Imaging in Nanoscale Topography (OligoDNA-PAINT)20–23, and it will incorporate specifications for the description of
 Oligopaint probes for genomic loci imaging to be compatible with existing genome browsers.
2. We will develop pipelines to ensure that laboratories within 4DN can produce and successfully transfer both FOF-bas
 and vCT (FOF-CT) datasets to the DCIC for incorporation into the 4DN Data Portal. These pipelines will include
 software tools to minimize the burden of manual curation and expedite data ingestion, Quality Control (QC) procedures
 to promote the upload of high-quality datasets, and automated rating of datasets (i.e., minimal, recommended, ideal)
 depending on standardized criteria such as the presence of quality metrics or common coordinated framework (CCF)
 nuclear mapping information.
3. We will develop prototype pipelines to establish the feasibility of sharing metadata-rich raw image data associated with
 FOF-CT results deposited to the 4DN Data Portal2 via general public repositories such as the OME-IDR12, or the BioImage
 Archive 24,25, 2.
The overall impact of the described deliverables will be to generate integrated public datasets to be used to benchmark the
development of tools for different aspects of the multiplexed FISH processing (i.e., drift and chromatic correction, single
particle detection and localization, spot fitting, filtering and calling, and feature segmentation) and post-processing
computational (i.e., machine learning classification and integrated modeling) pipelines.

depression worsens poverty, compromising economic productivity. Efforts to increase access to
depression treatment in LMIC have been hampered by low treatment uptake/engagement and weak
treatment effects. Recently, researchers & policy makers have pointed to the importance of poverty
alleviation in the fight again the global depression pandemic. Our ongoing NIMH funded study, ASHA,
is implementing an integrated poverty alleviation/depression treatment intervention for low-income

is key to improving science in this area. This application describes a fellowship training program, via the
Diversity Supplement mechanism, that will offer intensive training to a young psychologist who is the
first in her family to attend college. Ms. Shidad will participate in didactic, pragmatic, and hands on
research and training activities both in the US and in Bangladesh. She will work closely with ASHA PIs
and will conduct a small-scale study of the social network impacts of the ASHA trial. The traineeship will
support Ms. Shidad’s graduate school applications and prepare her in other ways for a career in global

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The increased incidence of autoimmune and inflammatory disorders highlights the need for improved
therapeutics to treat these diseases. Our work places RIPK1 kinase at the apex of inflammatory pathways
where it regulates a form of inflammatory cell death called necroptosis mediated by RIPK1, RIPK3 and
MLKL. In the work proposed, we will delineate novel necroptosis pathways important in autoimmunity and
immune-mediated liver injury operative in autoimmune and viral hepatitis.
We demonstrate that mice with a dendritic cell RIPK1-deficiency (Ripk1DC KO) develop inflammation and
autoimmunity; unexpectedly revealing that RIPK1 restrains necroptosis in dendritic cells (DC) in contrast to
it well established role as an initiator of necroptosis. During development, RIPK1 prevents necroptosis
mediated by the nucleic acid sensor Z-DNA binding protein (ZBP1) leading us to hypothesize that ZBP1-
mediated dendritic cell necroptosis breaks tolerance and induces autoimmunity. We will test this hypothesis
in Aim 1 by determining whether a ZBP1-deficiency prevents inflammation and autoimmunity in Ripk1DC KO
mice. We will identify the nucleic acid species bound to ZBP1 and will establish whether nucleic acid binding
is required to induce inflammation and/or autoimmunity. Nucleic acids in the Z-form are known to be highly
immunogenic and anti-Z-DNA autoantibodies occur in lupus patients; therefore, we will test genetically
whether inhibiting ZBP1 or necroptosis ameliorates disease in other autoimmune prone mice. In Aim 2, we
will investigate whether RIPK1-kinase-dependent necroptosis contributes to a mouse model of autoimmune
hepatitis (AIH) induced by the plant lectin Concanavalin A (Con A). Based on our preliminary data in
reciprocal hematopoietic chimeras we hypothesize that AIH is mediated by canonical necroptosis in
hematopoietic cells and noncanonical necroptosis in hepatocytes. Consistent with increased RIPK1 and
MLKL expression in the livers of AIH patients, our preliminary data implicate RIPK1 and MLKL but not
RIPK3 in hepatocyte cell death, leading us to hypothesize that a novel RIPK3 independent necroptosis
pathway is induced in hepatocytes. Going forward we will test this hypothesis rigorously by generating mice
that express kinase inactive RIPK1D138N or delete Ripk3 or Mlkl specifically in liver parenchymal cells. An
additional goal will be to delineate this non-canonical necroptosis pathway, by identifying the RIPK1-
interacting kinase responsible for MLKL activation in hepatocytes and to assess its contribution to AIH.
Successful completion of these Aims will elucidate the contribution(s) of these new necroptosis pathways
to autoimmunity and acute liver inflammation with the long-term goal to identify those
autoinflammatory/immune diseases that might benefit from RIPK1 kinase targeted therapy

This proposal describes the framework of an NIAID New Innovators DP2 award for Kiera Clayton, PhD. Dr.
Clayton is currently a postdoctoral fellow under the supervision of Dr. Bruce Walker at the Ragon Institute of
MGH, MIT and Harvard, whose current research focuses on T cell and NK cell-mediated killing of HIV-infected
macrophages, and the implications for HIV reservoir persistence and macrophage-mediated inflammation. In
addition to Dr. Clayton’s published work suggesting that macrophages are resistant to T cell-mediated killing,
preliminary results included in this proposal suggest that HIV exploits macrophages to evade NK cell-mediated
killing, by mechanisms distinct from those used to evade T cell responses. As macrophages also act as the
primary cellular reservoir for other chronic pathogens, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the question
remains whether macrophages provide a common “Hide-Out” for immunoevasion. Thus, the overall goal of this
proposal is to characterize the mechanisms employed by macrophages infected by different chronic pathogens
to evade immune-mediated clearance and explore the possibility of targeting a common immunoevasion
pathway to enhance T cell and NK cell killing of infected macrophages. This proposal focuses on three Research
Areas. The first Research Area will build on preliminary data to define the mechanisms by which HIV-infected
macrophages prevent NK cell-mediated killing. To quantify the resistance of macrophages infected with Mtb to
T cell and NK cell-mediated elimination and characterize the accompanying immunoevasion mechanisms, the
second Research Area will characterize the interactions between Mtb-infected macrophage and antigen-specific
T cells and NK cells. Finally, as Dr. Clayton’s published work suggests that inefficient killing of macrophages is
a result of resistance to apoptosis-inducing T cell-derived granzymes, the third Research Area will probe for the
identities of granzyme inhibitors expressed by macrophages, and subsequently knockout candidate genes to
enhance T and NK cell-mediated killing of infected macrophages. Together, these studies will provide insight
into whether targeting natural granzyme inhibitors can provide a common method to enhance immune-mediated
clearance of macrophages infected by different pathogens. The goals of this proposal are highly relevant to the
mission of NIAID, and will enhance our understanding of distinct pathogen-specific immunoevasion mechanisms
and those inherently characteristic of macrophages that allow for pathogen persistence despite strong immune
responses. Ultimately, this work will aid the design and development of therapeutics to target HIV and Mtb
infection in macrophages, and will potentiate future studies to assess how macrophage-mediated
immunoevasion contributes to persistence of other pathogens, including human cytomegalovirus.

The University of Massachusetts Chan Medical School seeks funding to continue its summer undergraduate
research program for undergraduates from groups traditionally underrepresented – by race, ethnicity, economic
and education disadvantage and disability status – in the biomedical sciences. The research training
opportunities available through this short-term training experience span the range from basic to translational to
clinical/epidemiologic research. Therefore, the program is very well suited to support the research interests of a
broad range of trainees. Many of these research training experiences are in areas supported within the research
portfolio of the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute. Importantly, UMass Chan Medical School provides a
very intensive research environment attracting almost $300 million in research funding in 2021.
The NIH funded program will support 16 trainees annually, a number readily justified by the large number of high
caliber applications received by the program each year. The program also benefits from sustained and significant
investment by UMass Chan in the form of personnel and direct financial support. This financial support provides
funds each year for an additional 10 trainees, most of whom do not meet NIH eligibility criteria. This support
additionally allows the program to provide critical activities and materials for the trainees, the costs of which are
not allowable under the NIH award.
The UMass Chan summer undergraduate research program is a highly structured residential program. Students
perform research in a group aligned with their interests. Students are introduced to critical tenets of Responsible
Conduct of Research that support rigor and reproducibility and ethical research conduct. Students enhance their
scientific communication skills through a series of small group sessions led by junior faculty and postdocs,
culminating in a poster presentation at the end of the program. A research lecture series and luncheon research
discussions expose participants to a broad range of research areas, potentially expanding the range of their
scientific interests, while also expanding their professional networks. Networking sessions with key leaders and
program directors at UMass Chan demystify the application process for doctoral degree programs and provide
additional opportunities for network growth. Program-organized social activities, to which former program
participants are invited, support social and professional networks. Program participants are also included in
institution-wide social activities at which current UMass Chan students are present, to enhance their sense of
belonging at the institution.
Participant outcomes indicate the impact of the program. Of 550 unique NIH-funded participants, 249 (45%)
have completed or are enrolled in a doctoral degree program - 185 in MD or DO programs, 54 in PhD programs,
and 10 in combined MD/PhD programs. Continued NIH funding will allow this successful program to continue for
an additional five year period.

Oligonucleotide-based therapeutics is an exciting and rapidly advancing field of research, spurred by the
groundbreaking discovery of RNA interference (RNAi) by Professor Craig Mello, Nobel Laureate, at the
University of Massachusetts Chan Medical School (UMass Chan). RNAi and antisense-based drugs have
shown clinical efficacy and are expected to become a significant class of therapeutic modalities. Fourteen
siRNA or ASO drugs have been approved, with many more in clinical development. The recent progress in
chemically modified guides for CRISPR-based therapies has also generated significant excitement. Advances
in oligonucleotide delivery to organs throughout the body, including liver, lung, central nervous system (CNS),
muscle, and kidneys, has led a growing number of investigators at UMass Chan to apply their disease and
target knowledge to develop transformative RNA-based therapeutics. The pharmacokinetic properties of
oligonucleotides are strongly influenced by their chemical structures, emphasizing the importance of advanced
modification patterns and design expertise. Unfortunately, academic investigators cannot readily access a
large number of therapeutic-quality, chemically modified oligonucleotides to identify drug leads. The RNA
Therapeutics Institute (RTI) at UMass Chan is widely recognized as a leading center in RNA chemical
innovation and translational research. Leveraging our expertise in chemistry, informatics, and delivery, we seek
to accelerate the development of innovative RNA-based technologies and therapeutics by establishing a high-
throughput production capability to synthesize 10,000 complex therapeutic RNA leads. This will allow
investigators to evaluate a large number of optimally modified oligonucleotides and identify the most potent
sequence-chemistry configurations. We are therefore seeking funds through a High-End Instrumentation Grant
to acquire the necessary equipment for high-throughput synthesis, purification, and quality control of
chemically modified RNA. The requested funds will be used to purchase state-of-the-art equipment, including
the Advion puriFlash XS520, Biolytic Dr. Oligo 192 XLc, Heated Pressure Chamber, Dr. Oligo Processor,
Agilent 1290 Infinity II Preparative LC/MSD and 6230B Time of Flight (TOF) LC/MS, Metrohm Compact Ion
Chromatograph (I.C. Flex), and Thermofisher SpeedVac SPD210. These cutting-edge instruments will allow us
to efficiently synthesize, purify, and analyze large numbers of chemically modified RNAs. This acquisition will
significantly enhance our basic and translational research programs, enabling the development of novel RNA-
based therapies for Huntington's Disease (HD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), organ rejection,
nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and other diseases, including rare/orphan diseases. The equipment will
support ongoing studies funded by 17 NIH grants and multiple grants from private foundations.

 National data from several non-communicable diseases (NCD) risk factors surveillance surveys in
Vietnam have shown disturbing increases in the prevalence of HTN between 2010 and 2020 (16% vs. 28%) in
persons aged 25-64 years old. Both urban and rural populations showed significant increases in the prevalence
of HTN over time in these surveys, though urban (15% to 31%) populations demonstrated greater negative
trends compared to rural (16% to 27%) communities. This can be attributed to increasing adverse lifestyle
practices, including unhealthy diets, physical inactivity, excessive alcohol consumption, and high levels of stress.
Urban residents were more likely to have important NCD comorbidities and reported having less time to manage
their HTN. The need for a large-scale and sustainable intervention approach for HTN control is emphasized in
the 2022-2025 national strategic plan of Vietnam. In our recently completed NIH-funded study, we developed a
multi-level, integrated approach for controlling HTN and successfully deployed it in rural northern Vietnam.
Preliminary results showed that our intervention is well-accepted and effective. We now propose to adapt this
work tailored to an urban Vietnamese setting using innovative implementation strategies to enhance intervention
delivery (mHealth platform and Integrated Health Care Delivery System). Our intervention adaptation process
will be guided by ADAPT-ITT model. Implementation and evaluation of the study will be guided by the EPIS
(Exploration, Preparation, Implementation, and Sustainment) framework. The HTN-URBAN intervention includes
three integrated components: (1) a storytelling intervention; (2) home BP self-monitoring; and (3) expanded
community health worker services.
 Our specific aims for the R61 phase are to: 1) conduct an HTN Needs Assessment (30 semi-structured
interviews) in Hai Phong city; 2) develop and refine HTN-URBAN based on the results of our HTN Needs
Assessment and the ADAPT-ITT model for adapting a proven intervention to a new setting and condition. Our
specific aims for the R33 phase are to 3) implement a cluster randomized type II Hybrid Effectiveness and
Implementation trial in 14 communities in Hai Phong, including 700 patients with uncontrolled HTN, randomized
to an intervention (HTN-URBAN of three integrated components) or comparison group (“Learn More” module -
didactic material only without stories) to assess the primary clinical effectiveness outcome (changes in BP) and
implementation outcomes including intervention acceptability, appropriateness, feasibility, adoption, and fidelity;
4) prepare for dissemination of HTN-URBAN by integration with the National Strategy on Prevention and Control
for Non-Communicable Diseases and building capacity in policy-relevant Implementation Science. This project
will address gaps in hypertension (HTN) control for adults living in urban setting in Vietnam by testing a multi-
level, evidence-based intervention with the promise of nationwide scalability and sustainability.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
Heterogeneity is a hallmark of the circulatory system and is manifest in a wide range of anatomical, cellular
and molecular differences that correlate with diverse blood vessel functions. A notable example of this
heterogeneity is found across the distinct capillary beds in multiple different organs and tissue types. These
capillary beds are the central functional unit of the circulatory system and serve as the sites for gas exchange,
filtration, hormone secretion, and immune cell trafficking. Each capillary bed is uniquely tuned to its organ-
specific function. For example, endothelial cells in liver capillaries are highly fenestrated and allow large
macromolecules to traverse their boundaries, while brain capillaries exhibit highly selective barrier function to
prevent toxic plasma components from damaging neurons. In this latter case, the function of these blood brain
barrier (BBB) capillaries is governed in part by vascular mural cells known as pericytes, which share a
basement membrane with endothelial cells. In the absence of pericytes, BBB function is lost, leading to
leakage, deficits in neurovascular flow, and eventual neuronal apoptosis. Accordingly, recent observations
indicate that pericyte loss may be a precipitating event in a number of neurodegenerative disease. Thus,
pericytes play an essential role in regulating organ-specific function of capillary beds in the circulatory system.
Despite their importance for vascular homeostasis, nothing is known about how pericyte identity is specified
and maintained during embryonic development, in contrast to most other cardiovascular cell types. By
leveraging our expertise using the zebrafish as a model system to investigate vascular development, we have
applied an integrated single cell molecular approach to identify candidate transcriptional networks that may be
responsible for establishing pericyte identity. Through this approach we have identified the first pericyte-
specific enhancer elements, including those that display organ specificity, along with cognate transcription
factors responsible for their expression. Our proposed studies will combine cutting edge genetic approaches,

regulatory programs responsible for pericyte identity. Taken together, our results will shed major new insights
into how this important cell type develops during embryogenesis.

Our proposal will examine a central mechanism of cell death pathways—the formation of large membrane
pores during the final stages of cell death. Recent studies have demonstrated that this process involves
Ninjurin1 (Ninj1), a membrane-spanning protein that multimerizes to form large membrane pores that lead to
membrane rupture. These membrane ruptures are essential for advanced signs of cell death and for the
release of larger inflammatory molecules required to mount an effective response to pathogens. The
multimerization of Ninj1 is critical for membrane rupture, but little is known about the specific mechanisms
underlying Ninj1 multimer formation or the direct implications of this oligomerization. This proposal will
determine how Ninj1 is activated by upstream steps of the cell death pathway, including caspase-8 and
caspase-1-driven signaling, and how gasdermin family members regulate this process. We will also examine
the contribution of Ninj1 activation in cell death pathways in the innate immune response to pathogens using
mouse models of Yersinia infection.
Our preliminary experiments demonstrated that Ninj1 expressed in myeloid cells is required for the host
response to Yersinia bacteria. We also showed that Ninj1 controls myeloid-cell driven defenses to Yersinia
infection in mice, underscoring the importance of Ninj1 in the innate immune response to bacterial infections.
Furthermore, our data suggest that GSDMD has a regulatory role in Ninj1 oligomerization initiated via both
caspase-8 and caspase-1. We hypothesize that GSDM proteins are modulating Ninj1 oligomerization and host
responses to caspase-8 and caspase-1 stimulations, and that Ninj1 oligomerization is a critical component in
effector-mediated immunity to Yersinia infections. Using Yersinia infections, cytokines, inhibitors, expression
systems and other tools, we will define the pathway controlling Ninj1 oligomerization during innate immune
signaling to cell death and inflammation to elucidate how this central step in multiple cell death pathways is
regulated.

 Metabolism is a well-established regulator of innate immune responses. Previous literature examined
metabolic changes upon activation of dendritic cells (DCs) by pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs)
from planktonic (free-living) bacteria, like the LPS, while little is still known about the metabolic reprogramming
induced by bacterial biofilms. Most bacterial pathogens thrive in biofilms, multicellular communities of bacteria.
Biofilms are potent virulence factors associated to recurrent and chronic infections and are resistant to DNAses,
proteases and even to antibiotics, providing a formidable challenge for clinical treatment. We have recently
reported that a bacterial amyloid termed curli, a dominant component in E. coli and Salmonella biofilms, forms a
natural complex with bacterial DNA and is a potent PAMP, activating DCs and macrophages.
 The objective of this exploratory project is to determine whether DCs acquire a specific metabolic profile
upon recognition of biofilm-specific PAMPs vs. PAMPs expressed also by planktonic (free-living) bacteria, with
the long-term goals of 1) understanding whether DCs mount distinct responses during biofilm-driven infections
vs. planktonic infections, 2) discovering new therapeutics to improve host defense. We hypothesize that
curli/DNA induce in inflammatory DCs a specific reprogramming that promotes innate and adaptive immune
responses against biofilms. This project will provide the foundation to study murine and human innate responses
to biofilms. In Aim 1, we will perform high resolution mass spectrometry to comprehensively profile the metabolic
changes that occur in DCs upon recognition of bacterial amyloid curli/DNA. We will compare these results with
better-known PAMPs LPS, CpG and Pam3CSK4, the latter two triggering the same TLR2/TLR9 that recognize
curli/DNA. We will test murine GM-CSF-monocyte-like DCs and human monocyte-derived DCs, as models of
inflammatory DCs. To confirm the metabolomics results, changes in the main metabolic pathways will be followed
using stable isotope tracing, the Seahorse Flux Analyzer, and biochemistry assays. In Aim 2, we will analyze the
transcriptome and cytokine secretome to identify the molecular pathways associated with the metabolic
reprogramming stimulated in DCs by bacterial amyloids and characterize the induced innate response. We will
compare these results with those from DCs exposed in vitro to bacterial biofilms. To start dissecting in depth the
underlying molecular mechanisms, we will study the purine salvage pathway, a metabolic pathway novel in DC
biology that was suggested by our Preliminary studies.
 This project will explore the innate immune response against bacterial biofilms through the recognition of the
most stimulatory component, the bacterial amyloids. It will indicate which metabolic pathways are candidates as
therapeutic targets to modulate immune responses to biofilms, starting with the purine salvage pathway, an
understudied pathway in DC biology, to strengthen innate responses against biofilm-driven infections.

largely unknown. Th1 immunity is the dominant mechanism of control. In contrast, how type 2 immunity affects
immunity to TB is a clinically important knowledge gap. Th2 immune responses are elicited by helminths
parasites, and half of the 180 million school age children in Sub-Saharan Africa are estimated to be infected
with helminths. Chronic helminth infection induces Th2 and Tregs, both which inhibit Th1 immunity, and impair
BCG efficacy. IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 are the canonical cytokines of Th2 cells. These cytokines are also produced
by innate cells including eosinophils and mast cells. We discovered that BCG vaccination worsens subsequent
Mtb infection in CC040 mice and is associated with the emergence of IL-4-producing cells in the lung. Our
overarching hypothesis is that IL-4 production in CC040 mice permits Mtb growth and exacerbates disease in
BCG vaccinated mice. While the mouse has been outstanding in developing immunological concepts that
translate into humans, standard inbred strains lack the genetic diversity of people. Th1 immunity develops
following Mtb infection in C57BL/6 (B6) mice, the “go to” strain for immunologists. However, B6 mice poorly
model other immune responses including Th2 and Th17 responses, and MAIT cells. To address the short-
comings of the murine TB model, we are using Collaborative Cross (CC) mice to study mechanisms of
vaccine-induced immunity against TB. CC mice are derived from eight founder strains that include wild-derived
mice. The breeding schemes captured >90% of the diversity present in the Mus species and led to the creation
of ~70 CC strains. In one of these, the CC040 strain, we detect a clinically relevant phenotype that is not
detected in traditional mouse models (i.e., B6). Using the CC040 mouse strain, we will ask how IL-4 affects
vaccine-induced protection against Mtb infection. We will determine which cell types produce IL-4 and whether
IL-4 is induced by BCG and/or Mtb infection. Next, we will measure how immunity is altered in an IL-4-sufficient
environment by performing scRNAseq of lung cells from IL-4-sufficient or depleted CC040 mice, following BCG
vaccination and Mtb infection. Two strategies will be used to determine how IL-4 affects vaccine-induced
protection against Mtb infection. Whether IL-4 is detrimental to BCG-mediated protection and heightens the
susceptibility of CC040 mice to TB will be tested by depletion of IL-4 or IL-4-producing cells. Another approach
will use genetic segregation and mapping analysis to determine the role of IL-4 signaling and identify genetic
susceptibility loci specifically driving IL-4-enhanced Mtb disease. New insights into how mast cells and
eosinophils affect TB susceptibility are changing the way we view immunity to mycobacteria. Clinical and
epidemiological data indicates that IL-4 production during chronic helminth infection could impair BCG efficacy
and immunity to TB. The CC040 strain will be an important tool to unravel how IL-4 and IL-4 producing cells
affect immunity to Mtb.

Cause Lung Pathology?
Respiratory viruses such as SARS-CoV1, Influenza and recently SARS-CoV2 (COVID-19) have caused the
major pandemics in the 21st century and influenza causes high levels of death from yearly circulating outbreaks.
T cells can target internal viral proteins, that mutate less frequently. Thus, T cell memory induced by previous
vaccination or infection can still be effective against emerging mutant viral strains. Tissue resident memory
(TRM) cells, that develop in the lung are at the first line of defense of our adaptive immune response against
respiratory infections because of their location. However, lung CD8 TRM, which are most- studied, are short-
lived. The few studies that have examined lung CD4 TRM suggest that they may decay less rapidly. We know
relatively little about lung CD4 TRM longevity and mechanisms of function, though they are known to protect
against many respiratory infections such Influenza, Sendai, B.pertussis, pneumococcal pneumonia and
tuberculosis infections. Moreover, we know little about the CD4 effectors that are precursors to the lung CD4
TRM. If CD4 lung TRM are longer-lived, they might compensate over the long-term for the rapid decline in CD8
lung TRM, thus making them good vaccine targets to provide strong more durable immunity.
A majority of the CD4 and CD8 T cells in human lung express TRM features, so it is vital to understand their
impact when they are reactivated during an immune response, both their positive effect on protection against
pathogens and negative effects on lung function and tissue damage. In many respiratory infections such as
influenza and COVID-19 there is also potential for severe lung damage leading to poor prognosis. We show that
cytotoxic CD4 T cells, that are resident effectors in the lung and that contribute to damage, can be precursors
oflung CD4 TRM. Thus, it is vital that we learn how CD4 TRM can both protect and cause lung pathology on
reactivation, especially if they are maintained long-term.
Here, we propose to identify the precursors of CD4 lung TRM from CD4 lung effectors, and better define their
protective and pathogenic potentials. We will phenotypically and molecularly characterize the CD4 TRM formed
from subsets of lung CD4 effectors. We will study their longevity and their maintenance via mechanisms such
as homeostatic proliferation and recruitment from circulation. Finally, we will study in detail their functional
mechanisms of eliciting protection vs those causing lung immunopathology by direct cytolysis, inflammation and
helper function. Understanding mechanisms/conditions driving protection and pathology by CD4 TRM will enable
design of interventions like vaccines and immunotherapies, that favor the development of protection while
minimizing pathology. Identifying precursor CD4 effectors that give rise to protective CD4 TRM will also allow us
to finetune vaccine approaches that drive generation of those CD4 effector subsets. In future studies, we will
use the knowledge gained here, to identify transcriptional networks that regulate the development of CD4 TRM
from CD4 effectors and naïve CD4.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
ADAM10 is a membrane-anchored endopeptidase that cleaves a range of membrane proteins at membrane-
proximal external sites, and thus causes the shedding of their ectodomains. We now find that HIV-1 virions
selectively incorporate considerable amounts of the active form of ADAM10. Our data indicate that ADAM10
cleaves the HIV-1 transmembrane protein gp41 within the membrane-proximal external region (MPER),
which leaves behind a C-terminal fragment (CTF) and causes the shedding of the gp41 ectodomain from
virions. Interestingly, Nef protects gp41 from cleavage by ADAM10, and thus increases the amount of virion-
associated Env glycoprotein. Furthermore, Nef-deficient HIV-1 replicates strikingly faster in the absence of
ADAM10, including in primary human CD4+ T cells. Additionally, we find that ADAM10 potently inhibits the
propagation of Nef-deficient strains bearing primary Envs from different HIV-1 clades, and that ADAM10
inhibits HIV-1 replication through its catalytic activity.
 To understand the role of ADAM10 in HIV-1 spreading, we propose to examine its effects on virus
infectivity and transmission, including the possibility that cellular ADAM10 substrates are involved. We also
propose to examine whether the suppression of gp41 cleavage by ADAM10 is a core function of Nef, and
whether it depends on the engagement of the clathrin adaptor AP-2.
 Interestingly, we have obtained a revertant with a point mutation in the gp41 MPER, the putative site of
ADAM10 cleavage, that fully rescued a Nef-deficient HIV-1 in the presence of ADAM10. We propose to test
the hypothesis that the MPER mutation protects gp41 from cleavage by ADAM10 because it alters the N-
capping propensity of the mutated residue. We also intend to examine whether the sensitivity of gp41 to
cleavage by ADAM10 correlates with the accessibility of the MPER in the unliganded Env spike.
 ADAM10 is regulated by TSPANC8 tetraspanins, which form complexes with ADAM10 and are thought
to determine its substrate specificity. We thus plan to determine the roles of individual TSPANC8 family
members in the cleavage of gp41 by ADAM10, and to explore whether Nef protects gp41 by altering the
repertoire of TSPANC8/ADAM10 complexes. We also plan to explore the possibility that Nef suppresses the
ADAM10-mediated cleavage of gp41 by reducing the exposure of phosphatidylserine, which is known to
activate ADAM10. Interestingly, this possibility is suggested by recent evidence that the Nef targets SERINC3
and SERINC5 are lipid scramblases that promote phosphatidylserine exposure on virions.
 The proposed studies have the potential to yield fundamental new insights into what constitutes a novel
mode of HIV-1 neutralization through the incorporation of a host protease. Of particular significance would be
the identification of specific TSPANC8/ADAM10 complexes as being responsible for the cleavage of gp41, as
this would offer the prospect of inactivating HIV-1 through agonists that selectively target these complexes.

E-cigarette use (vaping) in 18-24-year-olds is a public health crisis. It is an urgent public health
priority to communicate to young adults about the health harm of vaping to stop and prevent
them from vaping. However, effective communication has become challenging in the new age of
health misinformation and low trust in health experts. My goal is to investigate the role of a
trusted source and strategic message presentation to increase young adults’ acceptance of e-
cigarette education messages to impact their behavior. In this two-phased study, I will determine
an optimal source and message presentation type for young adult vapers and non-vapers,
respectively (K99) and examine the effects of messages optimized for source and presentation
on young adults’ vaping cessation and vaping prevention (R00). In phase 1 (K99), I will use a
multi-method approach to examine two source (expert and peer) and two message presentation
types (one-sided and two-sided) to identify the optimal message type for each vaping status
population. First, I will use crowdsourcing testing to collect self-report measures on message
acceptance, source trust, message reactance, and harm perceptions. Second, I will use
psychophysiological testing to measure participants’ eye-tracking, heart rate, and skin
conductance to assess their visual attention, orienting responses, and arousal during message
exposure. I will produce a single dataset integrating the crowdsourced and psychophysiological
data to determine the optimal source and presentation type for vapers and non-vapers. In phase
2 (R00), I will use a text messaging intervention in a randomized trial to examine the behavioral
effects of messages optimized for source and presentation to one’s vaping status (vapers and
non-vapers). Participants in each vaping status will be randomized to either the treatment
(receiving e-cigarette education messages with a source and presentation type optimized to
one’s vaping status) or control arm (receiving non-tobacco health messages) via text messaging
over the course of 6 months. I will examine vaping cessation rates among vapers and vaping
initiation rates among non-vapers. Results will inform the public health communication
campaign development and may apply to other public education campaigns to reduce tobacco
use in young people.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Hypertension in pregnancy is highly prevalent and increasing in the United States, and 40% of maternal deaths
involve women with hypertension. In adults from racial/ethnic minority groups, hypertension is two-fold more
prevalent and leads to higher rates of preeclampsia and stroke, thus resulting in devastating health
consequences in the infant and mother alike. The time required for frequent in-person visits, inadequate
counseling, and the asymptomatic nature of hypertension are major barriers to effective blood pressure (BP)
control in pregnant women. These issues can be addressed through home BP monitoring (HBPM), which holds
the potential to reduce preventable and devastating clinical events while also proven to reduce racial inequities
in pregnant women. Obstetric societies recommend HBPM for all pregnant women with hypertension, but our
pilot work suggests that rates of HBPM counseling and uptake are low. With the increasing use of mobile health
apps in pregnancy, there is an opportunity for digital health approaches with culturally appropriate storytelling to
improve HBPM and allow pregnant women with hypertension to learn from others with similar lived experiences.
This K23 Award proposes to develop Moms@Home, a digital health approach to support HBPM in pregnant
women with hypertension. Moms@Home will integrate storytelling videos with a Social Cognitive Theory-based
proven approach to support behavior change and address the cultural and literacy needs of a diverse population
of pregnant women. Incorporating storytelling with a successful digital health approach may increase the
adoption of HBPM. Guided by Patient and Clinician Advisory Groups, Aim 1 will adapt the existing mobile health
app MyDataHelpsTM to create Moms@Home for pregnant women with hypertension by incorporating stories from
women with similar lived experiences. Aim 2 will refine the Moms@Home components with obstetric caregiver
and patient interviews. Aim 3 will pilot test the Moms@Home approach in pregnant women with hypertension,
enriched in those from racial/ethnic minority groups, to assess HBPM adherence, feasibility, and acceptability.
Beyond the research plan, the K23 will provide Dr. Kovell with advanced research training, protected time, and
mentoring to become an independent physician-scientist focused on improving outcomes for pregnant women
with hypertension. Dr. Kovell will be guided by experienced mentors with expertise in digital health and study
design (Dr. McManus), behavior change (Dr. Lemon), peripartum/women’s health (Dr. Moore Simas), storytelling
and health equity (Dr. Allison), and biostatistics (Dr. Person). Her advisory team are experts in hypertension,
clinical trials, and informatics. In addition, her comprehensive career development plan will lead to a Master of
Science in Clinical Investigation degree and expertise in digital health, behavior change, and clinical trials. This
K23 award will set the stage for Dr. Kovell’s future R01 application examining digital behavioral health
interventions on BP control for pregnant women with hypertension. This innovative and scalable proposal has
tremendous potential to positively impact and support women with hypertension through healthy pregnancies.

The overarching goal of this proposal is to gain a deeper understanding of oligodendrocyte progenitor cell (OPC)
phagocytosis and determine how it compares to the phagocytic ability of microglia and its relevance for neurological
disease. Oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) are a pool of progenitors found in the adult brain that give rise to
mature, myelinating oligodendrocytes throughout life. Recent work has established that OPCs function as phagocytes
and engulf synapses within both the developing and adult brain. This challenges the long-held notion that the sole
function of OPCs is to generate new oligodendrocytes and establishes a role for OPCs in synapse pruning, similar to
microglia. However, there is currently no understanding of how OPC phagocytosis impacts their progenitor function or
how their phagocytic function compares to microglia. It is also unknown if OPCs function as phagocytes in the context of
neurodegeneration. I will now use a combination of in vitro and in vivo phagocytosis assays and live cell imaging to
compare OPC and microglial phagocytosis under steady-state conditions and during neurodegeneration and determine
how phagocytosis impacts OPC function as progenitor cells. In Aim 1, I will use in vitro phagocytosis assays coupled with
live cell imaging, OPC differentiation analyses, and RNA-sequencing to compare microglia and OPC phagocytosis of
synaptic substrates and determine how phagocytosis impacts OPC differentiation. In Aim 2, I will utilize an animal model
relevant to multiple sclerosis (MS) where the Schafer lab has shown early synapse loss and AAV-driven inhibition of
complement C3 deposition to determine if OPCs function as phagocytes in the context of neurodegeneration, and if this
phagocytosis is complement C3-dependent. The proposed studies will build on emerging work that challenges the
current thinking that microglia are the primary phagocytes of the CNS. It will reveal the role of OPC phagocytosis in
modulating the differentiation capacity of OPCs. It will also determine if OPC phagocytosis is dependent on the
deposition of the complement protein C3. These results will have implications for neurodegenerative diseases, as lack of
OPC differentiation is observed in multiple neurodegenerative states. Additionally, complement is now a target for
therapeutic intervention in a variety of neurological diseases, so understanding how this pathway regulates other cells of
the brain is essential for the effective use of these therapeutics. Finally, the experiments outlined here combine my
strength in OPC biology from graduate school with the expertise in microglia and mechanisms of phagocytosis in my
postdoctoral lab. Together, these studies will give me ideal training to achieve my goal of becoming an independent
researcher studying glia-glia interactions in neurodegeneration.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Project Abstract:
Certain viruses in the picornaviridae family, specifically enterovirus-D68 (EV68), have emerged as global health
concerns over the last decade with severe symptomatic infections with EV68 able to result in long lasting
neurological deficits and death. There are currently no US Food and Drug Administration approved drugs for any
non-polio enterovirus, highlighting the need to develop strategies against these lethal enteroviral strains. One
particularly attractive class of potential drugs are small molecules inhibitors, which can act as direct-acting
antiviral (DAA) inhibitors towards the conserved active site of EV68 3C protease. This main viral protease is a
cysteine protease conserved in the 3C family, responsible for cleaving eight sites along the viral polyprotein,
which is essential for viral propagation. DAAs designed to target 3C proteases can potentially achieve robust
inhibition across enterovirus species. However, as drug resistance in viruses can be prevalent, it is paramount
to design inhibitors less susceptible to resistance mutations. It was demonstrated previously in the Schiffer Lab
that when bound to protease, viral substrates occupy a conserved three-dimensional volume called the substrate
envelope. It was also demonstrated that inhibitors that extend beyond the substrate envelope are more
susceptible to drug resistance mutations. By utilizing the substrate envelope and cocrystal structures of the
proteases, DAAs designed to fit within the three-dimensional consensus volume as naturally occurring substrates
will interact primarily with functionally important residues and be less susceptible to drug resistance mutations.
The central hypothesis of this proposal is that cocrystallization of EV68 3C protease with its natural substrates
will enable the calculation of the substrate envelope to inform on substrate specificity, which will also aid in the
design of robust pan-3C-protease inhibitors. In Aim 1, I will determine the cocrystal structures of EV68 3C
protease bound to viral substrates. I will then use these structures to elucidate the molecular mechanism of
substrate specificity for EV68 3C protease and calculate the substrate envelope. These data will aid in small-
molecule design to create DAAs with improved resilience to mutations that can confer drug resistance. In Aim 2,
I will design and test novel DAAs that target EV68 3C protease. I will first characterize previously designed
inhibitors for other 3C and 3C-like proteases with the substrate envelope to establish a starting compound based
on potency. Inhibitors based on the scaffold will be designed, synthesized, and tested in a FRET-based enzyme
inhibition assay. Crystallization of novel potent compounds with EV68 3C and their characterization within the
substrate envelope will assess inhibitors’ susceptibility to drug resistance mutations. Overall, this study aims to
develop a robust, novel compounds with resistance-thwarting protease inhibition against the emerging pathogen
that is EV68.

HIV and food insecurity pose severe and interrelated problems in Latin America and the Caribbean, including
in the Dominican Republic (DR), where HIV ranks as one of the top 5 causes of death and our prior studies
have found that nearly 70% of people with HIV (PWH) have moderate or severe food insecurity. Despite the
established, detrimental role of food insecurity on poor HIV treatment outcomes, evidence on sustainable
interventions that address the cycle of food insecurity and poor HIV health is scarce. To address this gap, we
developed and piloted ProMeSA (through an R34 grant), an integrated urban gardens and peer nutritional
counseling intervention, and found it feasible, acceptable, and with preliminary efficacy at 6 and 12 months of
improving food security and HIV virologic suppression. The purpose of this five-year study is to conduct a fully-
powered cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) of ProMeSA to assess intervention efficacy evaluated over a
longer period (18 months) as well as mediators and barriers and facilitators to intervention uptake,
implementation, and sustainability. The specific aims are: (1) Determine the efficacy of an integrated urban
gardens and peer nutritional counseling intervention on the primary outcome of HIV viral suppression
[undetectable HIV viral load (VL)] and secondary outcomes of ART adherence and HIV care retention care
among people with food insecurity across diverse regions in the DR; (2) Examine the intervention effects on
intermediate outcomes posited to mediate the impact of ProMeSA on ART adherence, care retention, and viral
suppression; (3) Evaluate process-related factors associated with intervention uptake and implementation
(facilitators, barriers, fidelity, and replication costs) to inform future scale-up. The trial will include 20 HIV clinics
randomized to intervention or usual care control (n=25 per clinic; 500 total study participants). VL and other
key outcomes will be assessed at baseline, and 6-, 12- and 18-months. Following our intervention causal
framework and pilot findings, we hypothesize that ProMeSA will improve food security and diet quality and
reduce stigma and competing needs, which in turn will improve HIV clinical outcomes. The predominant causal
paths identified will inform tailoring ProMeSA to enhance impact in future dissemination and implementation. In
addition, we will collect extensive quantitative and qualitative data on intervention implementation and
participant experiences with the intervention across diverse settings and participants to inform scale-up. The
study involves a partnership among researchers from the University of Massachusetts Amherst, University of
California, San Francisco, RAND, and the Universidad Autonóma de Santo Domingo as well as the Dominican
Ministries of Agriculture and Public Health, the Dominican National HIV/AIDS Council, and the United Nations
World Food Program. To our knowledge, this will be the first full-scale trial to integrate nutritional counseling
with food-generating activities among PWH with food insecurity, in support of national and international goals
to achieve viral suppression and reduce the disease- and economic burden of HIV.

 Suicide is a leading cause of death worldwide, accounting for nearly 800,000 deaths each year.1,2
Suicide rates continue to increase in the U.S.3 Most research on suicide risk factors has identified static,
dispositional factors.4 These data inform us about groups at actuarial risk, but do very little to predict with useful
precision when people will have suicidal thoughts or act on suicide thoughts. Thus, there is an urgent need to
identify proximal risk factors for suicide risk.
 Two of the leading factors distally associated with increased suicide risk are dysfunctional emotional
responses5 and decision-making deficits.6 Suicidal individuals have poorer reinforcement learning,6,7
demonstrating impaired ability to learn and modify behavior in response to reward and punishment. Individuals
at high risk for suicide (i.e., borderline personality disorder) also show difficulties learning from punishment and
reward,8,9 and the PI’s data show that negative emotions uniquely impair learning in such high-risk populations
relative to healthy and clinical controls.10 It is necessary to understand the interactive effects of emotion and
reinforcement learning as factors elevating near-term risk for suicidal thoughts and behaviors.
 Therefore, the proposed study examines both emotional and cognitive processes associated with suicidal
thoughts and behaviors among 170 patients with a range of suicidal risk recently treated in an emergency
department for a suicidal crisis. Using innovative ecological momentary assessment methods (EMA), the
proposed study will examine behavioral measures of reinforcement learning and both physiological and
subjective measures of momentary emotions. Aim 1 identifies the main and interactive effects of emotional
responses, reinforcement learning, and emotion-related decrements in learning on recent suicidal thoughts and
behaviors among suicidal patients recently seen in the emergency department. Aim 2 examines how emotions
and learning interact to predict momentary suicidal thoughts and behaviors over four weeks. Aim 3 tests emotion-
related decrements in learning as prospective predictors of future suicide risk over a six-month follow-up.
 The research team (PI: Dixon-Gordon, Co-Is: Ammerman, Boudreaux, Rathlev; Consultants: Hackel;
Collaborator: Laws) has access to world-class expertise, with extensive experience recruiting suicidal
participants from medical settings, EMA, computational modeling, and experimental psychopathology.
 The most important challenge facing suicide prevention today is unraveling the complex emotional and
cognitive proximal drivers that transform nascent suicide risk into action. Combining state-of-the-art behavioral
measures and EMA, we will tease apart the complex longitudinal relations between dysfunctional emotional
responses, reduced capacity to learn from reward and punishment, and fluctuations in suicidal thoughts and
behaviors. Given the high societal costs of suicide, this work has important health significance. Findings will
inform the development of treatments that target emotion dysfunction and learning in samples at-risk for suicide.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Genetic analyses of polygenic brain disorders, such as autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) and schizophrenia
(SZ), have revealed “synaptic dysfunction” as a key cellular substrate for these disorders. Yet, translating this
synaptic hypothesis to in vitro disease modeling and extracting disease-relevant biological information has
been challenging. The PI has previously established a human neuronal model of SZ, combining isogenic
genome engineering, patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), and induced neuronal
differentiation (iN cells). Human neurons bearing mutations in the synaptic cell adhesion molecule Neurexin-1
(NRXN1, 2p16.3), a bona fide risk allele for SZ, display deficits in excitatory synaptic strength and
neurotransmitter release probability as well as a consistent upregulation of calcium/calmodulin-dependent
serine protein kinase (CASK) protein level, by which the mechanism is currently not understood. It remains
unclear how these phenotypes arise and lead to synaptic pathology and abnormal neuronal networks
implicated in the disease. In this grant, we aim to understand the cell type- and developmental-specific
functions of NRXN1-CASK interaction in normal synapse development and their mechanistic contributions to
SZ. Using synaptic molecules as a proxy, we will dissect how disruptions in the synaptic pathway can prime or
actively participate in SZ. We will achieve this by studying aberrant CASK signaling in NRXN1 mutant
background (Aim 1), investigating CASK’s normal function at human synapses using CASK KO induced
neurons (Aim 2) and by revealing key cellular events mediated by NRXN1 and CASK during human forebrain
development using KO cortical spheroid models (Aim 3). Our work integrates techniques in imaging,
electrophysiology, biochemistry and single cell RNA-seq with rigorous experimental designs using isogenic
engineered and patient-derived iPSCs from multiple genetic and gender backgrounds, differentiation of pure
induced neuronal subtypes with defined synaptic characteristics and differentiation of 3-D cortical spheroids
with characterized cellular features. Findings of this grant will provide mechanistic understanding of the
molecular and cellular underpinnings of neuropsychiatric disorders and such information will translate to other
disorders of the synapse, including intellectual disability, ASDs, and bipolar and mood disorders.

Heparin is arguably the most versatile biopolymer, capable of interacting with and modulating the behavior of an
impressive variety of biomolecules even outside of its native environment (mast cell granules). A large fraction
of heparin interactome in the human body are key players in a variety of physiological processes (including
several pathologies) and are considered high-value therapeutic targets, although at present antithrombin
remains the only protein whose interaction with heparin has been successfully exploited in medicine. Successful
exploitation of heparin’s unique versatility for other therapeutic purposes critically depends on the ability to
characterize its interactions with relevant proteins; however, specific molecular mechanisms remain elusive
outside of the very few extensively studied systems. In the previous period of support, we developed powerful
analytical tools capable of providing information on protein/heparin interactions at the whole molecule level, as
well as identifying specific structural motifs within highly heterogeneous heparin macromolecules that enable
their association with specific proteins. Building upon this success, we now propose to focus our inquiry on
understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying etiology of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), a
serious (and potentially fatal) immune disorder affecting up to 5% of patients receiving heparin as an
anticoagulant. Despite the central role played by heparin in formation of antigenic aggregates that may lead to
development of HIT, relatively little is known about the specific molecular mechanisms governing these
interactions. This not only creates a tremendous challenge vis-a-vis the ability to design efficient anti-HIT
therapeutic strategies, but also prevents a reliable prognosis of the occurrence of this pathology. Recognizing
the importance of multiple factors that may modulate interaction of heparin with relevant proteins (mostly platelet
factor 4, PF4), we will use a multi-level strategy to study the mechanism of PF4/heparin association, architecture
of these aggregates and specific features that make them immunogenic and trigger the onset of HIT. The work
will be carried out in close collaboration with the Hematology team at McMaster University Health Centre headed
by Dr. I. Nazy, a leading expert in the field of thrombocytopenia and thrombosis. This knowledge will catalyze
efforts to develop reliable diagnostic and prognostic tools for HIT, and will be critical for designing safe and
effective therapeutic intervention strategies.

Arsenic contamination in the food chain is a global health problem and causes damage to most human organs.
A significant need exists to develop approaches for addressing environmental arsenic. The long term goal is to
develop a plant-based phytoremediation approach for contaminated land that is cost-effective and ecologically
friendly as an alternative to conventional remediation methods. The objective of this study is to develop a
genetics-based phytoremediation strategy for arsenic uptake, translocation, detoxification, and
hyperaccumulation into the fast-growing, high biomass, non-food crop Crambe abyssinica. Nanosulfur will be
utilized to modulate the bioavailability and phytoextraction of As from soil and to increase the storage capacity
via enhanced sulfur assimilation. The engineered Crambe will be evaluated for removing arsenic from the soil in
laboratory, greenhouse, and field conditions. Our central hypothesis is that organ-specific expression of genes,
which control the transport, oxidation state, and binding of As, can be tuned to yield efficient extraction and
hyperaccumulation into above-ground plant tissues. To test our hypothesis, we propose the following specific
aims. 1) Genetically engineer Crambe abyssinica lines for co-expressing bacterial ArsC, gECS, and AtABCC1
and RNAi suppression of endogenous arsenate reductase CaACR2; 2) Evaluate the engineered Crambe lines
for metal(loids) tolerance and accumulation; 3) Synthesize and apply nanosulfur to modulate the bioavailability,
phytoextraction, and accumulation of toxic metal(loids); and 4) Conduct a pilot field study of engineered Crambe
lines for phytoextraction on a contaminated site. After initial screening in tissue culture media supplemented with
metals, the best performing quadruple gene stacked (ArcS+gECS+AtABCC1+CaACR2Ri) Crambe lines with wild
type controls will be tested using contaminated soils with arsenic as well as co-contaminants in greenhouse. A
pilot field-scale study will then be carried out at a site contaminated with arsenic. The soil will be extensively
characterized, and analysis for metal content and arsenic speciation will be determined using ICP/MS, HPLC-
ICP/MS as well as XANES (X-ray Absorption Near-Edge Spectroscopy). Last, soil amendments with engineered
nanosulfur will be used to evaluate the impacts on soil structure and contaminant availability and phytoextraction.
Nanosulfur will also be foliarly applied to plants to increase the metal storage capacity via enhanced sulfur
assimilation. The expected outcome of this project is a mechanistic understanding of the biogeochemical and
plant processes of arsenic remediation that connects key soil characteristics with the efficiency of phytoextraction
and hyperaccumulation of arsenic. The results will have an immediate and important positive impact because
the knowledge generated from this study will enable efficient and effective phytoremediation approaches to
minimize or remove arsenic contamination in the food chain and enhance public health.

Early life stage exposures to toxicants can result in islet malformations, which may predispose individuals to
diabetes. The glutathione redox microenvironment plays fundamental roles in embryonic development and cell
signaling, perturbation of which can result in functional or structural alterations that only become apparent with
subsequent stress or age. Surprisingly little is known about how embryos respond to oxidative stress, or the
impact of toxicant exposures on pancreatic β-cell development. This project takes a multi-level approach using
state-of-the-art techniques to elucidate the complex pathophysiological mechanisms by which exposures to
Per-and-polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) that cause oxidative stress derail islet development, and the
consequences for β-cell function. We test the central hypothesis that deviations from the GSH redox
microenvironment and aberrant activation of the transcription factor Nrf2- at the wrong place and the wrong
time- impair β-cell development and function. There are three overarching goals of this project: 1) to deepen
our understanding of the role of Nrf2 activation in embryonic β-cells and islet development; 2) ascertain the
impact of PFAS on insulin biosynthesis; and 3) identify β-cell fragility and bioindicators of later-life metabolic
impacts that can be translated to human health. We will use transgenic zebrafish, confocal microscopy and
immunofluorescence, redox proteomics and insulin misfolding assays, and cultured β-cells to investigate
exposures to two common PFAS (PFOS, PFHxS), and a legacy aqueous film-forming foam (AFFF). This work
will have a sustained and powerful impact on the fields of developmental toxicology, redox biology, and the
developmental origins of health and disease and provides critical advances towards developing science-based
PFAS guidelines, targets for clinical interventions, and public health policies.

Targeting of Bioorthogonal Chemotherapeutic Nanozymes to Tumor-Associated Macrophages
 In our proposed research we will use bioorthogonal chemistry to target tumor-associated macrophages
(TAMs) in breast cancer, using bioorthogonal chemistry to turn them into ‘drug factory’ platforms for generation
of chemotherapeutics at the tumor site. We will use our ‘nanozyme’ platform to encapsulate and protect transition
metal catalysts (TMCs) within the monolayer of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). These nanozymes will be targeted
the mannose receptor strongly upregulated in TAMs. Systemic delivery of these nanozymes is anticipated to
provide effective localization to TAMs that are highly accessible in tumors. Subsequent administration of non-
toxic prodrugs will then provide uncaging of the chemotherapeutic localized to the tumor site.
 In our proposed research we will optimize the activity of our nanozyme platform. We will then engineer the
nanozymes for selective TAM uptake through ‘stealth’ zwitterionic coating and suitable targeting elements. The
targeting and therapeutic efficacy of the nanozymes will be quantified in vitro using mono- and co-culture models,
Optimized particles will then be downselected for in vivo evaluation. Our specific aims are:
Aim 1: Fabrication of Bioorthogonal Nanozymes. Goal: Engineering of monolayer structure to provide highly
 active and stable nanozymes. We will fabricate nanozymes coated with a zwitterionic layer to minimize
 non-specific uptake and mannose to target TAMs. We will optimize catalyst loading and stability in serum,
 and determine catalyst reactivity with prodrugs.
Aim 2: In Vitro Activity and Targeting Studies. Hypothesis: Targeted nanozymes will provide highly cell-selective
 activation of prodrugs. We will quantify the intracellular activity of nanozymes in cells through catalytic
 uncaging of prodyes and prodrugs. Targeting efficacy to TAMs will assessed versus unpolarized
 macrophages and other cells, and in vitro therapeutic efficacy determined using co-culture models,
 optimizing the system based on specificity, efficacy/therapeutic window, and timing.
Aim 3: Targeting of Prodrug Activation In Vivo. Hypothesis: Targeted nanozymes will localize prodrug activation
 to tumor sites, providing highly effective tumor therapy. We will use systemic injection of mannose-
 targeted nanozymes to activate profluorophores and prodrugs at tumor sites using 4T1 orthotopic breast
 carcinoma models. Quantitative tumor and intratumoral nanozyme distributions will be obtained using
 inductively-coupled mass spectrometry, and efficacy quantified by tumor size and mouse health.
 The overall goal of this project is to perform therapeutic ‘jiu-jitsu’, using TAMs that normally protect tumors
to provide launch points for highly localized therapeutic delivery to tumors. This bioorthogonal therapeutic
strategy is expected to reduce off-target effects and increase therapeutic efficacy relative to current
chemotherapeutic approaches.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Abstract/Summary:
The vertebrate craniofacial skeleton is a dynamic organ that arises and is maintained through an
intricate balance of genetic and environmental inputs. Disruptions to either can lead to deleterious
health outcomes. While significant progress has been made toward understanding the genetic and
cellular mechanisms that underlie early craniofacial patterning, much less is known about the basis for
craniofacial variation that manifests over extended periods of development, and depends upon the
environmental context in which it occurs. Whether it's the physical interactions between cells and
tissues within the developing embryo, or the mechanic forces imposed on the system, these contexts
will determine how genetically-encoded systems unfold over time to determine craniofacial geometry.
 Implicit to these ideas is feedback in the system. Feedback is how disparate developmental units
come together to form integrated functional systems - e.g., reciprocal signaling between adjacent but
developmentally distinct tissues. It is also necessary for normal growth and homeostasis in kinetic
systems - e.g., progenitor cells must sense environmental inputs, including mechanical load, and adjust
developmental processes accordingly. Broadly speaking this proposal seeks to understand how both
types of feedback are regulated at the genetic level. In doing so, three specific questions will be
addressed: (1) What are the genes that contribute to craniofacial shape? (2) Do they exert their effects
on more than one tissue, either via pleiotropy or as part of the same signaling pathway? (3) How do
these loci interact with the environment, via mechanosensing, to affect variation in facial form?
 Cichlid fishes will be used as the experimental model, as they have undergone extensive
evolutionary modifications of their skulls and jaws in a very brief period of time, making them ideal for
genetic/genomic mapping. Cichlids are also well known for their capacity to remodel their jaws under
different foraging environment, but not all cichlids share this ability, and thus plasticity itself is
genetically determined and has diverged in this system. Cichlids therefore represent an ideal model to
identify and parse the genetic, environmental, and GxE effects that underlie craniofacial variability. This
proposal leverages these experimental attributes, and integrates advanced phenotypic, genotypic and
functional tools to provide a more holistic understanding of the mechanisms that underlie craniofacial
shape.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：SUMMARY
Sound localization is a fundamental auditory ability that is facilitated by differences in the sound reaching each
ear. Localization is important for safety and for auditory awareness in natural 3D environments. Binaural
hearing also supports spatial release from masking, where detection and recognition are improved by spatially
separating the primary source – the target – and interfering sources – the masker. Spatial release from
masking is critical for speech recognition in noisy backgrounds, especially when the background contains
competing speech. What we do not understand yet is the relationship between these two phenomena of
binaural hearing – localization and spatial release from masking. The studies in this project ask whether sound
localization and spatial release from masking arise from the same binaural mechanisms but are otherwise not
closely related, or whether sound localization is the basis of spatial release from masking, particularly in
situations were targets and maskers are highly confusable with one another. It is an important question,
because listener complaints about hearing difficulties in noise might well be due to poor sound localization,
although this is not evaluated in clinical practice. While there have been hints of a causal relationship in the
literature, the question is a difficult one to answer and the field has not come to a consensus. This three-year
project will be the first that we are aware of to singularly and comprehensively focus on the relationship
between sound localization and spatial release from masking, using rigorous psychoacoustic methods with
recently developed signal processing tools and stimuli that dissociate binaural difference cues and perceived
intracranial location. The findings will help us make sense of the conflicting literature that has been difficult to
interpret, and will move the field toward theoretical and practical advances that will help inform professional
management of hearing loss and its consequences for listening in noise.

 Aromatase inhibitors (AIs) are drugs that inhibit estrogen synthesis and that are prescribed to prevent
the recurrence of estrogen responsive breast cancers. However, AIs, such as the commonly prescribed Letrozole
(LET), are associated with severe side-effects that further burden the quality of life, including insomnia, hot
flashes, depressive symptoms and cognitive deficits. The precise mechanisms by which AIs may give rise to
these CNS symptoms remain unclear and difficult to study in humans, as control for individual differences in
disease severity, treatment history and experienced stress is lacking. Furthermore, AI treatment is recommended
for 3 to 5 years, yet little is known about the effects of long-term AI use on the brain and behavior, especially
with regards to age-related cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk. We propose to develop a primate
model for AI-induced CNS effects to advance our knowledge in this area and facilitate the design of novel
therapeutics.
 This application uses the marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), a small primate with a brain architecture, sleep
patterns, cognitive abilities, emotional responses and thermoregulation patterns that are comparable to those of
humans (1) to study the effects of chronic LET use on the brain and behavior and (2) to test whether DHED, a
prodrug that delivers E2 selectively to the brain, can effectively and safely prevent LET-associated adverse
effects.
 To achieve these aims, middle-aged male and female marmosets treated with LET, LET + DHED or
Vehicle for 3 years will be studied longitudinally for changes in sleep/wake patterns, cognitive performance,
emotional regulation, and thermoregulation. The monkeys will be outfitted with an activity monitor for sleep/wake
patterns analysis. Cognitive function will be assessed via an automated computerized battery. Thermal imaging
will be used to measure changes in facial skin temperature during a thermal challenge. Emotional regulation will
be assessed by measuring heart rate variability and facial skin temperature in monkeys viewing emotional and
neutral videos. Following these in vivo behavioral assessments, analyses of brain tissues from underlying brain
regions (hypothalamus, hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, locus coeruleus) will be carried out to quantify gene
expression of selected genes, tauopathies, β-amyloid deposition and neuronal excitability.
 The results will have important translational applications for AI-treated patients by (1) characterizing the
effects of AIs on multiple neural and behavioral outcomes; (2) determining whether long-term estrogen
suppression promotes the development of an AD-like phenotype and (3) whether providing the brain with an
alternate source of estrogen can counteract the adverse effects of AIs on the brain and behavior.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
CD8 T cells play a critical role in the elimination of infected and cancerous host cells. The success of these
immune responses depends on the proper maintenance (survival and proliferation) and precise differentiation of
CD8 T cells. Upon antigen stimulation, activated antigen-specific CD8 T cells undergo clonal expansion and
differentiate into effector lymphocytes with cytolytic function. Although the majority of effector cells die after
antigen clearance, a few antigen-specific cells survive and form long-lived protective memory CD8 T cells.
However, during chronic infection and cancer, the immune response is often compromised: CD8 T cells exhibit
defects in survival and proliferation, fail to form memory cells and instead are diverted to differentiate into
exhausted cells which are characterized by the loss of effector function. Thus, it is of utmost importance to
understand the underlying mechanisms that regulate the maintenance and differentiation of CD8 T cells. We
have already demonstrated that let-7-mediated posttranscriptional mechanism controls the differentiation and
function of effector T cells. Furthermore, our preliminary results suggest that modulation of let-7 levels have a
profound impact on the maintenance of T cells, memory formation and diversion into exhaustion. To investigate
the molecular mechanisms of let-7 regulation in CD8 T cells we propose the following aims:
Aim-1 will determine the molecular basis of let-7-mediated effects on CD8 T cell maintenance: bcl-2-dependent
survival and cdc34-driven proliferation. Aim-2 will dissect let-7-mediated mechanisms that guide CD8 T cell
differentiation: Eomes-dependent and Eomes-independent molecular programs. To address these aims we will
analyze the maintenance and differentiation of CD8 T cells with different levels of let-7 microRNAs into effector,
memory and exhausted T lymphocytes using infection and tumor models. We expect to identify novel
posttranscriptional mechanisms that regulate the outcome of CD8 T cell-mediated immune responses. It is
anticipated that these experiments will define let-7 as a new therapeutic target.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Various forms of chronic distress have been linked with premature aging, and development of cardiometabolic
diseases (CMD), which are leading causes of death for older adults. Both chronic distress and CMD conditions
are strongly linked with risk of Alzheimer's Disease and Alzheimer's Disease-Related Dementias (AD/ADRD).
While metabolic changes affecting vascular health are proposed as a key pathway driving the relationship
between chronic distress and major diseases of aging, understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying
such metabolic changes is limited. High-throughput technologies permit simultaneous measurement of
hundreds of metabolites in plasma (“metabolomics”) and provide a broad picture of an individual’s metabolic
profile. In our first funding cycle, we developed and validated a liquid chromatography-tandem mass
spectrometry (LC-MS)-based metabolomic score of chronic distress (anxiety and depression), in independent
data sets of largely non-Hispanic White women; this score was associated with higher risk of incident CMD. In
this renewal, using cutting edge metabolomic and biostatistical approaches along with several additional cohort
studies, we propose to extend our initial findings and address the following specific aims: (1) Strengthen our
existing chronic distress metabolite-score by adding novel, previously unknown metabolites strongly
associated with the distress phenotype, and biochemically identify these validated but unknown metabolites to
provide new mechanistic insight; (2) Assess our chronic distress metabolomic score (and its components) in
key populations including African-American (AA) and Hispanic men and women and White men, and optimize
the score in each population. We will also evaluate associations of the score (and components) with CMD and
secondarily AD/ADRD risk in AA men and women, White men, and preliminarily in Hispanic men and women,
and (3) Evaluate if chronic distress influences the distress-related metabolite score using causal methods and
evaluate the distress-metabolite score as a potential mediator of the relationships of chronic distress with CMD
risk and secondarily with AD/ADRD risk. We will achieve our aims by leveraging the robust data resources of
five prospective studies: the Jackson Heart Study (n=5,306; 100% AA men and women), the Multi-Ethnic
Study of Atherosclerosis (n=6,814; 39% White, 28% AA, 22% Hispanic, 12% Asian-American men and
women), the Nurses’ Health Study (NHS; n=121,700, 98% White women), the Women’s Health Initiative
(n=161,808 women; 18% non-White), PREDIMED (n=7,447; White men and women). Each cohort has
similarly assessed chronic distress, blood metabolomic profiles, relevant covariates, CMD and dementia risk
outcomes over up to 20 years of follow-up. NHS and MESA also have genetics data and repeated
metabolomics measures. This work will extend our understanding of biologic pathways underlying chronic
distress and their association with subsequent CMD and dementia risk among both women and men and
across racial and ethnic groups.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Slightly over 1 in 5 children in the United States are growing up in a household that speaks a language other
than English. For these children, developing bilingual skills will allow them to communicate both with family
members who have limited English skills and with English-speaking teachers and peers. However, for children
with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), there is limited research about how to facilitate their bilingual
development. Professionals and parents have often assumed that learning two languages would be too
challenging, especially for children with minimal spoken language skills. While several studies over the past
decade have demonstrated that bilingual exposure is not detrimental for language development in children with
ASD, these studies have focused mostly on the acquisition of English rather than examining factors that
promote development of both languages. Furthermore, bilingual studies have generally excluded children with
minimal/low verbal skills. The proposed sequential mixed-methods project places a new emphasis on
variability within the bilingual experiences of children with ASD and their families. It seeks to identify factors
associated with children’s skills in both languages, as well as their social-cognitive skills such as perspective-
taking and cognitive flexibility. The quantitative phase will include 60 Spanish-speaking families with children
with ASD (ages 4-6), including children who are minimally verbal. The first aim is to characterize sources of
variation in the types of bilingual language environments experienced by children with ASD (e.g., different
languages from caregivers vs. therapists; different languages from different caregivers; code-switching by
bilingual caregivers; changes in language choices over time). The second aim is to examine predictors of
children’s dual-language communication and social-cognitive skills, including the role of quantity and contexts
of Spanish exposure. In a qualitative phase conducted with a subset of 30 families, the third aim is to interpret
the quantitative findings in reference to family perspectives, priorities, experiences, and challenges with
language choices and support services. The long-term goal of this work is to collaborate with families and
service providers to develop interventions that support bilingual families and promote the linguistic and social-
cognitive development of children across the autism spectrum. This career development proposal includes an
expert team of mentors from Psychology, Communication Disorders, and Public Health. The training goals
focus on conducting research with minimally verbal children with ASD, mixed methods, and using community-
based participatory research to develop and evaluate interventions. The research aims and training goals of
this career development award reflect current priorities in the strategic plan of the NIDCD for Voice, Speech,
and Language, including Improving Diagnosis, Treatment, and Prevention in Understudied Populations
(Priority Area 3) and Improving Outcomes for Human Communication through community-based research
(Priority Area 4).

 The “brain-eating amoeba” Naegleria fowleri causes a disease with a 97% fatality rate. Current
treatments are not reliable and risk significant side effects, including brain damage. Because cell proliferation is
essential for disease progression, and the microtubule network in Naegleria has evolutionarily diverged from
that in humans, targeting the mitotic spindle is a promising strategy to develop effective therapeutics with
limited side effects. However, we lack key information about the basic cell biological mechanisms that organize
the Naegleria mitotic spindle, hampering progress towards rational therapies. In particular, dynamic
microtubule turnover is critical in other cells for assembling a bipolar spindle, but it is not known to what extent
the Naegleria spindle relies on microtubule dynamics. A major obstacle is that inhibitors that block microtubule
dynamics in other species are ineffective against Naegleria’s divergent tubulins. Further, while microtubule
motor proteins play key roles in assembling spindles from diverse species, the function or even the identity of
microtubule motors within the Naegleria spindle is completely unknown. Lack of knowledge about the
mechanistic contributions of microtubule turnover and molecular motors to Naegleria spindle organization
constrains identifying key proteins and processes to target for antimicrobial development.
 This proposal will address this knowledge gap by testing the hypothesis that microtubule dynamics and
molecular motors both contribute to Naegleria spindle organization. To identify the role of microtubule
dynamics, microtubules will be stabilized with a class of inhibitors that was recently shown to block Naegleria
cell division, and the effect on the organization of the spindle will be measured with super-resolution
microscopy. Comparing untreated and drug-treated spindles at different mitotic stages will reveal which stages
require microtubule turnover. To determine the function of molecular motors in the spindle, motor genes
upregulated during cell division will be identified with RNA sequencing of mitotically synchronized Naegleria
cultures. These motors will be knocked down, and phenotypes scored by microscopy. The proposed project
will provide comprehensive training to prepare the applicant for a career as an independent investigator. With
support from a sponsor, who is a Naegleria expert, and a co-sponsor, who has decades of experience studying
cell division, the applicant will learn: new experimental techniques, such as super-resolution microscopy and
high-throughput sequencing; new conceptual approaches, including the biology of microtubules and mitosis;
and career development skills. This proposal will determine the impact of microtubule stabilization on the
Naegleria spindle and will identify the role of spindle associated molecular motors in spindle organization,
providing new targets for future treatments for the devastating disease caused by Naegleria.

Knowing how to act in response to cues in our environment is a critical behavior. Making optimal choices involves
engaging the necessary neural networks to seek rewards (e.g., food etc.), avoid negative outcomes (e.g., injury
etc.), and ignore irrelevant information. Aberrant network activity in response to cues leads to maladaptive
behavioral responses, something characteristic in many psychiatric disorders including PTSD, addiction, autism
spectrum disorder, and schizophrenia. The brainstem nucleus locus coeruleus (LC) and brain-wide levels of
norepinephrine (NE), a majority of which originates from LC, are vital for engaging appropriate behaviors in
response to cues. Recent discoveries emphasize the unexplored complexity in the organization of LC and its
role in responding to cues that elicit behavior. Distinct ensembles of LC neurons encode different cognitive
processes and behaviors. Furthermore, discrete LC subcircuits are required to parse various LC functions. My
long-term goal is to dissociate the complex role of LC and NE in regulating adaptive and maladaptive behaviors.
The specific objective of this proposed research is to identify the functional LC neural ensembles and projection
targets necessary to appropriately respond to positive and negative reinforcement cues. To achieve this goal, I
will (1) characterize LC neural activity acquired from high density electrophysiology probes and (2) identify and
modulate LC projections with an activity dependent viral labelling strategy during an active avoidance and reward
seeking task. My central hypothesis is that opposing cue-outcome associations recruit separate LC neuron
ensembles and circuits necessary for appropriate behavioral responses, even when outcome-associated
behaviors are similar. In Aim 1 I will analyze large scale electrophysiology data obtained from high-density
Neuropixel probes to characterize LC neuronal activity during active avoidance and reward cue presentation. I
hypothesize that there will be separate and distinct ensembles of neurons that respond to cues prompting similar
actions to either receive a positive outcome vs avoid a negative outcome. In Aim 2 I will use calcium-dependent
genetic tagging, Cal-Light, to identify and inhibit discrete LC projections driven by behavior-evoking cues. I
hypothesize that LC ensembles for active avoidance and reward seeking cues preferentially target different brain
regions forming functional subcircuits. Furthermore, I will test my hypothesis that activity in these LC subcircuits
is necessary for appropriate behavior. The proposed research will identify LC ensembles and projections
underlying optimal behavior, highlight circuits that may contribute to maladaptive behavior, and inform circuit-
based treatment targets for PTSD and other psychiatric disorders.

Targeting of Bioorthogonal Chemotherapeutic Nanozymes to Tumor-Associated Macrophages
 In our proposed research we will use bioorthogonal chemistry to target tumor-associated macrophages
(TAMs) in breast cancer, using bioorthogonal chemistry to turn them into ‘drug factory’ platforms for generation
of chemotherapeutics at the tumor site. We will use our ‘nanozyme’ platform to encapsulate and protect transition
metal catalysts (TMCs) within the monolayer of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). These nanozymes will be targeted
the mannose receptor strongly upregulated in TAMs. Systemic delivery of these nanozymes is anticipated to
provide effective localization to TAMs that are highly accessible in tumors. Subsequent administration of non-
toxic prodrugs will then provide uncaging of the chemotherapeutic localized to the tumor site.
 In our proposed research we will optimize the activity of our nanozyme platform. We will then engineer the
nanozymes for selective TAM uptake through ‘stealth’ zwitterionic coating and suitable targeting elements. The
targeting and therapeutic efficacy of the nanozymes will be quantified in vitro using mono- and co-culture models,
Optimized particles will then be downselected for in vivo evaluation. Our specific aims are:
Aim 1: Fabrication of Bioorthogonal Nanozymes. Goal: Engineering of monolayer structure to provide highly
 active and stable nanozymes. We will fabricate nanozymes coated with a zwitterionic layer to minimize
 non-specific uptake and mannose to target TAMs. We will optimize catalyst loading and stability in serum,
 and determine catalyst reactivity with prodrugs.
Aim 2: In Vitro Activity and Targeting Studies. Hypothesis: Targeted nanozymes will provide highly cell-selective
 activation of prodrugs. We will quantify the intracellular activity of nanozymes in cells through catalytic
 uncaging of prodyes and prodrugs. Targeting efficacy to TAMs will assessed versus unpolarized
 macrophages and other cells, and in vitro therapeutic efficacy determined using co-culture models,
 optimizing the system based on specificity, efficacy/therapeutic window, and timing.
Aim 3: Targeting of Prodrug Activation In Vivo. Hypothesis: Targeted nanozymes will localize prodrug activation
 to tumor sites, providing highly effective tumor therapy. We will use systemic injection of mannose-
 targeted nanozymes to activate profluorophores and prodrugs at tumor sites using 4T1 orthotopic breast
 carcinoma models. Quantitative tumor and intratumoral nanozyme distributions will be obtained using
 inductively-coupled mass spectrometry, and efficacy quantified by tumor size and mouse health.
 The overall goal of this project is to perform therapeutic ‘jiu-jitsu’, using TAMs that normally protect tumors
to provide launch points for highly localized therapeutic delivery to tumors. This bioorthogonal therapeutic
strategy is expected to reduce off-target effects and increase therapeutic efficacy relative to current
chemotherapeutic approaches.

 HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) causes the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). HIV/AIDS
is one of the most serious public health challenges in the world. Early diagnosis of HIV can improve health
outcome and reduce HIV transmission effectively. Currently nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) and
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) are the common methods for HIV detection. However, they can
be only performed by professionals in a central laboratory. There is an essential need for development of point-
of-care (POC) tools for early HIV detection. The p24 antigen is a protein biomarker that can be used for early
detection. However, current POC testing tools have a poor limit of detection (LOD) toward p24 detection, which
cannot be used for testing HIV within less than two weeks of post-infection
 The objective of this project is to develop a paper-based lateral flow strip (PLFS) for rapid, in-field
detection of the p24 antigen in finger-prick whole blood samples. A plasmon-enhanced fluorescent sensor will
be developed by utilizing a hierarchical three-dimensional nano-architecture. The chip-based fluorescent
sensor and a plasma-separation unit will be integrated into a single paper-based microfluidic strip to enable
blood sample pretreatment, fluid transport and analyte detection. The performance of the integrated PLFS will
be tested in terms of limit of detection, sensitivity, selectivity and applicability to clinical patient samples.
 This need-driven work capitalizes on the expertise and skills of a multidisciplinary project team in device
development, statistical modeling, medicine, HIV biology and clinical diagnosis. The discovery-driven research
is novel because of the several appealing features. That is, incorporation of a blood plasma separation unit into
the PLFS will eliminate the need of sample pretreatment in a central laboratory. The three-dimensional
plasmonic nanostructure will enhance the sensitivity of the near-infrared fluorescence sensor. The PLFS can
be read out by a commercial, battery-powered, hand-held fluorescence reader. The portable device can be
employed as a POC tool for measuring p24 antigen in finger-prick (or heel-prick) blood samples in a minimally
invasive way at home, in a clinic or other resource-limited settings. It can be used for self-testing by an
untrained lay-person, and for early infant diagnosis. The data obtained from this portable device will assist
early diagnosis of HIV within first two weeks of post-infection. Early detection of HIV infection will improve
medical intervention outcome, and reduce HIV transmission, leading to substantial reduction in HIV/AIDS-
related mortality and morbidity as well as economic costs.

Mosquito-borne pathogens, including malaria, Zika, dengue, and chikungunya continue to be a major public
health concern globally. As only older mosquitoes are infectious and represent a risk to human health, scientists
have sought to age-grade mosquitoes based on this understanding; however, no reliable, cost effective and
practical methods exist to age mosquitoes despite the tremendous epidemiological value of this approach. The
overall objective of this R01 is to establish a novel approach to age-grade mosquitoes Aedes aegypti in the field.
The approach we took is based on surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) to analyze the biomolecules
from mosquito water extract that are bound with silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) and then the SERS spectra are
used in modern machine learning models to age-grade the mosquitoes. Our central hypothesis is that AgNPs
interact with specific biomolecules enabling SERS to generate unique and predictable spectral information for
establishing modern machine learning models to determine the age of mosquitoes. Our prior work demonstrates
the feasibility of SERS and Artificial Neuron Networks (ANNs) to determine the age of both lab (error <1 day)
and field-collected (error < 2 days) mosquitoes Ae. aegypti. In the proposed work, we will establish robust lab
and field-deployable protocols to produce reliable and repeatable SERS data of mosquito water extract. Then,
we will manipulate the lab and field conditions to determine the impact of biotic (food and infection status) and
abiotic (temperature) to SERS characteristics. Robust and accurate machine learning model based on modern
ANNs and Domain Adoption (DA) strategies will be established and validated for age-grading mosquitoes in the
field. In addition, we will explore the Multi-task Learning (MTL) strategies to simultaneously determine the age
and infection status. Our long-term goal is to establish a rapid, cost-effective, and field-deployable system that
enables real-time analysis and data sharing to facilitate epidemiological studies, risk assessment, vector control
intervention monitoring and evaluation.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：The Kritzer lab focuses on inhibiting protein-protein interactions involved in autophagy. Autophagy is a protein
degradation pathway that is active in all human cells, and inhibiting autophagy shows promise as a therapy for
late-stage cancers especially in combination with DNA-damaging chemotherapies. Autophagy research and
drug development currently rely on compounds that inhibit autophagy indirectly. Better, more specific inhibitors
of autophagy would be broadly adopted. A large amount of genetics and cell biology work supports that
inhibiting the LC3/GABARAP family of proteins can block autophagy selectively. In one series of projects, we
will develop novel stapled peptide and small molecule inhibitors of LC3/GABARAP and evaluate them in
models of late-stage cancers and other diseases.
Because of our expertise in compounds that bind LC3/GABARAP proteins, we also propose to evaluate related
compounds as autophagy-targeting chimeras (AUTACs). These compounds could be used to selectively
degrade any proteins in the cell, similar to proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) but potentially more
versatile and easier to develop. Based on strong preliminary data that validate the AUTAC concept, we will
develop novel AUTACs and demonstrate their ability to degrade endogenous proteins, unlocking a
broad new area for drug development in targeted protein degradation.
Over the course of developing stapled peptides as autophagy modulators, the Kritzer lab encountered a
common problem in the field: how to measure the amount that actually reaches the cytosol. In an
independent series of projects, the Kritzer lab has developed novel assays that quantitate the cytosolic
penetration of large-molecule therapeutics. In this proposal, we describe new opportunities to address
challenging problems in drug development for large-molecule therapeutics. We describe new methods to
measure penetration to different cellular compartments in any cell type, including primary cells. We also
describe a molecular evolution approach to develop a new “turn-on” assay that measures the real-time
kinetics of cytosolic penetration. We describe pooled CRISPR screens to reveal the cellular components
that mediate endosomal escape. Finally, we describe a novel screening platform that will allow us to screen
thousands to millions of molecules at a time for those that are most cell-penetrant; the new screen will be
incorporated into a design-test-learn cycle to produce data-driven design algorithms for cytosol-penetrant
molecules. All together, these data will represent a huge leap in our understanding of structure-penetration
relationships for several classes of large-molecule therapeutics.

 Almost half of the human genome is composed of repetitive DNA elements, and about three percent of
the genome is composed of microsatellites, short tandem repeats of 1-6 DNA bases. Many repeat sequences
can form alternative DNA structures that interfere with replication and repair. This can lead to disease-causing
repeat expansions, such as the CAG/CTG expansions that cause Huntington’s disease, myotonic dystrophy,
and many spinocerebellar ataxias. Breaks within structure-forming repeats cause chromosome deletions and
rearrangements, which are common in cancer cells undergoing replication stress. The goal of my laboratory is
to study mechanisms of genome instability caused by structure-forming repeats, and to elucidate cellular
pathways that have evolved to prevent these deleterious mutations. We recently discovered that long tracts of
structure-forming CAG repeats relocate to the nuclear periphery to facilitate replication through the tract and
prevent chromosome breakage and repeat expansions. This pathway depends on modification of proteins at
the replication fork by sumoylation, and subsequent interaction of the sumoylated proteins with components of
the nuclear pore complex (NPC) in late S phase, followed by release back into the nuclear interior in G2 phase.
Recent data shows that this pathway is relevant for several types of replication barriers, including protein
blocks and other structure-forming repeats. Therefore, it is vital to better understand the purpose of this
relocation to the NPC and its role in facilitating replication and preventing genome instability, which is our long-
term goal.
 We have developed a system to follow the location of an expanded CAG tract or other structure-
forming repeats in the cell nucleus using microscopy, complemented by biochemical techniques to detect
proteins interacting with the repeat locus. We will use the budding yeast (S. cerevisiae) system which allows us
to combine these approaches with the powerful genetics of the yeast system. Yeast replication and repair
pathways retain a high level of conservation with human cells, but the smaller size of the yeast genome and
proteome and wild-type (non-transformed) state of cells are advantages that will allow us to make significant
progress on our goals. We plan to elucidate the purpose of relocation of stalled replication forks to the nuclear
pore complex and the mechanisms that occur there to allow restart of replication forks, using both established
and novel approaches. We will also determine how nuclear pore-linked fork restart prevents chromosome
breaks and repeat instability and determine how repeat expansions occur during fork recovery. Our aim is to
understand NPC-dependent modification of replisome-associated proteins and fork remodeling that occurs at
replication barriers, and in so doing understand vital cellular processes that maintain genome stability. This is
important because understanding how mutations arise is critical to developing strategies to prevent their
occurrence.

Osteoarthritis (OA) is a highly prevalent and debilitating disease that currently has no effective therapy. OA has
many risk factors, such as joint injury and aging. However, many people with these risk factors do not develop
OA or develop it to a lesser extent. Individual responses to the same treatment are often also highly variable,
hampering the testing of therapy in a reasonable-sized population. Thus, there is an urgent need to understand
the basis for the diverse manifestations of OA. One driving factor of OA is proposed to be local inflammation.
As prolonged inflammation elicits catabolic changes in the joint, the ability of each individual to resist
inflammation could be directly linked to the trajectory of disease progression. Identifying factors that provide
the competence to resist inflammation may be key to elucidating the cause of OA progression in individuals.
Our long-term goal is to investigate OA pathogenesis to improve its treatment. The goal of this grant is to
investigate the competence to resist inflammation and joint destruction conferred by an underexplored
molecule (Wnt7a) from the Wnt signaling family. This proposal is based on our study that showed a striking
negative-exponential relationship between Wnt7a and catabolic genes in individual human cartilage
specimens. When Wnt7a expression was below a certain threshold, the samples were almost always of OA
background, as if low levels of Wnt7a signify a higher risk of OA. In this way, Wnt7a may be a key factor
associated with OA variability. Ectopic expression of Wnt7a under normal conditions did not impact cartilage
matrix levels, but strongly halted joint destruction in experimental OA, suggesting that Wnt7a provided the joint
with a certain ability to resist OA. Thus, we hypothesize that the level of Wnt7a within articular cartilage
determines the competence against inflammation and impacts the trajectory of OA in each individual,
forming the basis for OA variability. This hypothesis will be tested in two Specific Aims by 1) investigating
whether Wnt7a alters the course of inflammation and the trajectory of cartilage loss and joint destruction in OA
and 2) identifying downstream pathways and upstream regulators of Wnt7a. We will use gain- and loss-of
function approaches on mouse OA and human cartilage specimens. The novelty of this study lies in the
concept of Wnt7a as a competence factor for OA resistance in individuals to explore the mechanism of
heterogeneity in OA, and in the use of advanced imaging technologies to test these concepts. These studies
will define the role of Wnt7a in curtailing prolonged inflammation and the propensity for degenerative changes
in OA. Furthermore, it will identify fundamental mechanisms for enhancing or preserving endogenous Wnt7a
function in cartilage for joint protection. Thus, this work will provide important mechanistic insights into OA
progression and its variability and the design of strategies to treat this disease.

 Neutrophils (PMNs, polymorphonuclear cells) are pivotal innate immune cells that directly mediate
pathogen clearance through release of reactive oxygen species (ROS), degranulation, neutrophilic
extracellular traps (NETs) and phagocytosis. The bacterial pathogen, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis (Yptb)
antagonizes these antimicrobial actions by injecting critical virulence proteins, called Yops, into PMNs. We
seek to understand mechanisms that mediate clearance of bacterial pathogens in tissue infection by
understanding the processes that are disrupted by YopH and YopO. We have shown that SKAP2 is one
essential target of YopH in PMNs in tissue infection; however, SKAP2 is not the only essential target of YopH
in tissue infection. Missense mutations in SKAP2 are associated with the development of autoimmune
disorders and cancers. This suggests that PMN dysfunction downstream of SKAP2 signaling has wide ranging
implications beyond infection control. We have further shown that SKAP2-dependent mechanisms in
neutrophils are critical for limiting growth of another Gram-negative pathogen, Klebsiella pneumoniae (Kp), in
lungs. Using PMNs derived from myeloid progenitor (MP) hematopoietic stem cells, we found that SKAP2 is
essential for extracellular (ROS) production but is not required for degranulation after Kp infection. Surprisingly,
SKAP2 is required for Syk phosphorylation after infection by Kp, but not for Syk phosphorylation after
stimulation of CLRs and integrin receptors, indicating that neutrophil recognition of Kp is via a distinct receptor,
possibly a G protein coupled receptor (GPCR). The objective of this application is to use our expertise in
murine infection models, MP-PMN genetic manipulation, bacterial genetics and live-cell visualization of protein
complexes, to understand pathways in PMNs that are targeted by YopH and YopO. We will further investigate
whether these targets play crucial roles in the control Kp. To this end, our specific aims are to (1) Dissect the
modular functions of SKAP2 required for generating anti-microbial responses in neutrophils after infection with
Kp. (2) Understand the effects of YopO on GPCR signaling in PMNs during murine infection. (3) Identify the
SKAP2-independent pathways that are targeted by YopH to inactivate neutrophil degranulation. After
completion of these studies, we will understand how SKAP2 and other Yop-targeted proteins work in PMNs to
control infection by Kp and Yptb. A thorough understanding of molecular mechanisms that signal for the
release of the tissue damaging bactericidal factors, ROS and granules, by PMNs during infection should lead
to novel and targeted approaches to manipulate these pathways to enhance these activities during infection
with multidrug resistant bacteria and to stop excessive damage due to uncontrolled PMN responses in a
variety of auto-immune diseases.

Macrophages are key effector cells of the immune system, with critical functions in killing of microbes,
production of inflammatory regulators, and tissue repair. However, an excessive macrophage response
contributes to the pathology of cancer as well as inflammatory and degenerative diseases. In addition,
unchecked proliferation of macrophage precursors in lieu of differentiation leads to acute myeloid leukemia. To
better address how to modulate macrophage function to help abate diseases that involve changes in
macrophage biology, we must understand the critical molecular pathways that govern macrophage
differentiation and regulate their activity.
We propose that one of these pathways will involve mRNA polyadenylation, an essential maturation step in
which mRNA precursor is trimmed at its 3' end and a poly(A) tail (pA) added. Changing the position of the pA
site through a process called alternative polyadenylation (APA) plays an important, increasingly appreciated
role in regulation of gene expression. Shortening of the 3' untranslated region can remove regulatory
sequences that control RNA stability, translation, and subcellular localization, whereas coding region
shortening can dramatically alter protein function. While global changes in APA have been observed in tumor
progression and other types of cellular differentiation, the contribution of APA to macrophage differentiation
has not been studied.
We hypothesize that a global shift in APA is required for macrophage differentiation and that this shift is
driven by changing levels of APA regulators. Our objective is to determine how APA contributes to
macrophage differentiation, with the long-range goal of defining how this might be manipulated in therapeutic
settings to promote differentiation and modulate macrophage function. Our specific aims will 1) determine the
global pattern of APA during macrophage differentiation, the functional classes of genes impacted by APA,
and sequence features that might characterize these sites, 2) define drivers of macrophage APA and the
consequence that altering their expression has on differentiation as well as well-characterized macrophage
functions such as cytokine production, migration, and phagocytosis, and 3) determine the molecular
mechanisms that alter the levels of the proteins that regulate APA. Because macrophage are a first line of
defense for many diseases and dysregulation of their differentiation leads to leukemias, our proposed studies
should ultimately inform new therapeutic tools to modulate macrophage production. They will also broadly
advance our understanding of general and tissue-specific APA paradigms. s

Tuberculosis (TB) requires the simultaneous administration of multiple antibiotics to eradicate heterogeneous bacterial populations. Treatment duration ranges from 6 months for drug susceptible TB to 24 months and longer for extensively resistant TB. With a number of recent drug approvals and promising clinical development candidates, there is hope for much needed treatment shortening. However, we need high-throughput methods to rank the very large number of possible drug combinations and reduce them to a feasible number for testing in clinical trials. Currently, drug regimens are prioritized based on efficacy in the mouse model, which despite its ease of use, is available for only a small subset of all possible combinations. In addition, differentially drug-susceptible bacterial subpopulations that are found in human pulmonary lesions are not well recapitulated in murine lungs. A hallmark of TB is the formation of lesions and the coincident remarkable ability of Mycobacterium tuberculosis to persist in a variety of lesion types during drug treatment. These hard-to-treat bacterial subpopulations cause disease relapse. Therefore, key to prioritizing new regimens is systematic, high-quality in vitro measurement of multidrug regimen potencies and a framework that links in vitro measurements to efficacy in different types of human-like lesions. To do so requires that we develop in vitro models that capture key lesion-specific stressors and harness the potential of combination therapies to identify drugs that act synergistically. We propose to bridge this gap by developing a data-driven pipeline to rapidly prioritize drug regimens by combining in vitro and in vivo measurements of drug action with mathematical modeling. (1) We will utilize efficient measurement of drug combinations in a variety of growth conditions for direct comparison of combination drug effects in lesions. (2) We will leverage the human-like properties of pathology in non-human primates to query drug efficacy in distinct lesion compartments. (3) We will apply the power of multiscale (molecular, cellular, granuloma and organ scales) mathematical modeling to identify the stressors that are most predictive of in vivo efficacy. To build the pipeline, we will leverage a new drug regimen that has performed surprisingly well in clinical trials but the components of which antagonize in standard potency assays in vitro: the NiX-TB regimen comprising bedaquiline-pretomanid-linezolid. Once validated for NiX-TB versus standard of care, the pipeline will be used to rationally optimize and re-invent the NiX regimen using data-driven computational simulation.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Many pathogens grow within host cells by building membrane-bound replication compartments essential for
growth. The compartments provide important protection from host innate immune cytoplasmic surveillance
systems and interfere with trafficking organisms into degradative compartments. Growth in the compartment
is driven by microbial proteins which promote compartment construction, protection against innate immune
surveillance and provide regulatory control over the host cell. How these different arms of the pathogen are
coordinated is poorly understood. A bacterium that uses this strategy is Legionella pneumophila, which
grows in a vacuole within macrophages during pneumonic disease. A group of over 300 Legionella proteins
are translocated into host cells, controlling all aspects of the intracellular lifestyle, including formation of the
replication compartment, blocking host cell translation, and preventing cytosolic recognition of the
replication compartment. The organism hijacks host tubular endoplasmic reticulum (ER) as one of the
earliest steps in replication compartment formation, an event promote by the bacterial Sde proteins.
The proposed studies will test two models for Sde function. First, it will test the model that the Sde proteins
controls ER tubule formation, replication compartment formation, and immune avoidance by promoting a
three-step pathway. Secondly, it will test the model that manipulation of host translation initiation plays a
role in coordinating replication vacuole construction and immune avoidance. The first model proposes that
the Sde deubiquitinase activity liberates free ubiquitin (Ub) from the polyUb on the replication compartment.
This would serve as a pool for ADPribosyltransferase and phosphodiesterase domains to promote Ub
modification of the tubular ER protein Rtn4 and host translation initiation factors (eIFs). In the final step, the
protein family masks the replication compartment with a phosphoribose to prevent recognition by the host
autophagy pathway. The model will be tested by manipulating polyUb pools in the cell, performing electron
microscopy on mutants deranged in this pathway, and reconstructing tubular ER rearrangements in a cell-
free system. To determine the role that targeting of eIF proteins plays in these processes, the targets will be
verified using purified components and the regulated initiation step will be identified. In addition, it will be
determined if eIF proteins are inactivated to remove ribosomes from rough ER and allow close docking of
ER sheets to the replication compartment, and if eIF manipulation skews the host translational response to
favor bacterial replication. Extensive preliminary studies support the proposed experiments, providing a
solid underpinning for this work. Throughout these studies, the objective is to identify a weak link in the
microbial strategy of manipulating ER tubules to promote intracellular growth, with an eye toward
developing antimicrobials that target this process.

The human pathogen Vibrio cholerae, the causative agent of the disease cholera, regulates
virulence factor production, biofilm formation, competence, and other important processes
through quorum sensing (QS), a cell-cell communication mechanism that relies on the production,
detection, and response to chemical signal molecules called autoinducers. QS allows bacteria to
coordinate population-wide gene expression and function as coordinated groups. We have
identified four QS signaling pathways that integrate into the central QS circuit of V. cholerae.
Importantly, we found that disruption of these four sensory pathways altogether renders V.
cholerae unable to colonize animal hosts. Our data also suggest that ethanolamine and cyclic
AMP (cAMP), respectively, are responsible for controlling two of these receptors, CqsR and VpsS.
In Aim 1, we will determine how ethanolamine and other related molecules regulate CqsR. In Aim
2, we will determine how cAMP regulates VpsS. In Aim 3, we will define the regulatory hierarchy
in the V. cholerae QS circuit. Specifically, we will determine the roles of a recently discovered
cyclic dinucleotide called cyclic GMP-AMP in QS gene regulation. Together, our work will not only
define the role of QS in V. cholerae pathogenesis, it will also illustrate how integration of multiple
signals results in a coherent response in a bacterial cell-cell communication process. It is now
well established that QS is employed by many bacterial species to regulate both harmful and
beneficial traits. A long standing goal in the field is to develop pro-QS and/or anti-QS molecules
to manipulate bacterial group behaviors. Our hope is to harness the knowledge on QS to enable
the design of interference strategies that can be translated into new therapies to combat infectious
diseases.

Calorie restriction (CR) is a promising nutritional strategy with the potential to slow the aging process. The
Comprehensive Assessment of Long-term Effects of Reducing Intake of Energy (CALERIE) trial, funded by the
National Institute on Aging, was the first clinical trial to demonstrate the feasibility of achieving sustained,
moderate CR in healthy, young and middle-aged adults without obesity. During the 2-year CR intervention,
participants achieved 12% CR on average and, compared to an ad libitum intake control group, experienced
remarkable improvements in markers of healthspan and a slower rate of biological aging. The overarching goal
of this proposed study is to examine whether 2 years of CR results in long-term improvements in the biological,
phenotypic, and functional hallmarks of human aging. We hypothesize that exposure to a 2-year CR
intervention in early to mid-adulthood results in sustained lower rates of biological aging, delayed
manifestations of phenotypic aging, superior indices of functional aging, and greater quality of life compared to
ad libitum intake. To test this hypothesis, we will conduct an observational follow-up study of CALERIE
participants 10 to 15 years after the end of their trial participation. Participants from the CALERIE CR group will
be compared with an ad libitum intake comparison group composed of the CALERIE ad libitum control group
and a matched community-dwelling cohort from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA). The well-
characterized BLSA cohort is included as a comparison sample to address the concern that the highly
screened CALERIE controls may have been healthier than the general population and highly motivated for
behavior change. The BLSA also has the rigor, quality control, and several of the same outcome
measurements as the CALERIE trial to facilitate comparisons. The proposed CALERIE follow-up study will
include a comprehensive set of physical and functional assessments, including resting metabolic rate, body
composition, cardiorespiratory fitness, grip strength, and cognitive function, in addition to psychological and
quality-of-life measures. Blood and urine also will be collected and analyzed for markers of biological aging and
cardiometabolic disease risk. Comparisons will be made between CALERIE CR participants and the combined
ad libitum intake comparison group (the CALERIE ad libitum control group and the BLSA cohort). Evaluating
legacy effects of the CALERIE trial will determine the effectiveness of a CR intervention in early to mid-
adulthood for preventing the development or delaying the progression of age-related chronic disease. The
proposed trial will augment the CALERIE data and biospecimen repository for future research to advance our
understanding of human aging.

Skeletal muscle loss and impairment – prominent features of the aging process – lead to physical disability.
There is plausible evidence that altering components of the diet, mainly protein intake and acid/base balance,
may improve indices of muscle health in older adults and thus translate to a reduction in physical disability. A
growing number of studies suggest that increasing protein intake using a whey protein supplement may benefit
muscle health in older adults. However, a main concern is that high protein results in a large dietary acid load
from the breakdown of protein to acidogenic byproducts, which could in turn promote muscle degradation
particularly in older adults with age-related declines in renal excretion of acid. Thus, our hypothesis is that the
balance between the amount of protein in the diet (anabolic component) and the net acid load of the diet
(catabolic component) in part determines whether the diet as a whole has a net anabolic or catabolic effect on
muscle. Preliminary data from our group have suggested that a daily potassium bicarbonate (KHCO3)
supplement improved lower extremity muscle power in postmenopausal women. Based on our preliminary data,
we plan to conduct a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2x2 factorial study in which sedentary men
and women age 65 and older on baseline lower protein diets will be enrolled. Participants will assigned to one
of four groups: either a whey protein supplement (to raise protein intake to 1.5 g/kg/d) with or without KHCO3
81 mmol/d or an isocaloric placebo supplement with or without KHCO3 81 mmol/d for 24 wks. The primary
outcome is lower extremity muscle power. Secondary outcomes are lower extremity muscle endurance,
physical performance, lean mass, and 24-hr urinary nitrogen excretion. Twenty-four-week changes in these
outcomes will be compared in the 4 groups. Our central hypothesis is that higher protein intake plus a
neutralizing alkaline salt will have additive effects on muscle performance and mass in older adults to either
intervention alone. If successful, this research could result in a paradigm shift in dietary advice to older adults
to reduce physical disability. As 1 in 5 US adults will be over age 65 by year 2040, a safe dietary intervention
that reduces age-related musculoskeletal decline will be an important preventative health step for our aging
society.

Osteosarcoma (OS), the most common malignant bone tumor in humans and dogs, shares several features in
both species including clinical presentation and molecular alterations. Despite numerous efforts there have been
no improvements in disease outcome for either species in the past three decades: 30% of people and 90% of
dogs still die of metastasis. While some approaches have shown promise in the setting of microscopic disease,
in both species, macroscopic metastasis exhibits inherent resistance to multiple agents (kinase inhibitors,
chemotherapy, immunotherapy, among others). I recently characterized the canine OS genome and found that
as with human OS, the somatic mutational load is low, copy number aberrations/structural variants predominate,
and no clear molecular drivers are evident. These data, along with a history of failed clinical trial efforts suggest
that contemporary approaches to therapeutic advancement such as kinase inhibitors and immune checkpoint
blockade will likely have limited clinical impact, necessitating the development of innovative therapeutic
strategies. A distinguishing feature of cancer cells is their ability to undergo aerobic glycolysis, allowing them to
thrive in a variety of microenvironments. Monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs) are key facilitators of this, moving
lactic acid across the plasma membrane, and are critical for growth and metastasis of glycolytic tumors, such as
OS. In previous work, I found that loss of MCT1 or MCT4 function in OS cells decreases basal and compensatory
glycolysis, cellular proliferation and invasive capacity. I also showed that MCT4 is a direct transcriptional target
of STAT3 and FOXM1, both of which exhibit constitutive activation in OS, supporting a link between
MCT4/STAT3/FOXM1 and aerobic glycolysis. Building on these data, I will by leverage a comparative cross-
species approach to first define regulatory circuits that support aerobic glycolysis mediated by MCT1/MCT4 in
OS and then identify and validate therapeutic vulnerabilities related to MCT control of cellular metabolism. I
hypothesize that in OS cells, sustained MCT1/MCT4 expression is driven by constitutive STAT3/FOXM1
activation and increased MYC copy number, thereby promoting aerobic glycolysis. I further predict that
loss of MCT1/MCT4 through genetic manipulation or targeted inhibitors will impair tumor growth in vivo,
and that this can be maximized through rational drug combination. To accomplish this, I will first
characterize the transcriptional regulation of MCT1/MCT4 in OS using a combination of ChIP-sequencing,
bisulfite sequencing and 4C/ChiA-PET analysis. Xenograft studies in mice will complement in vitro analyses to
assess how loss of MCT1/4 function affects OS metabolic profile, tumor phenotype and tumor growth. Lastly, I
will use a zebrafish model to screen select agents for synthetic lethality with MCT blockade, then validate findings
in mice. The rich research environment afforded by Tufts University and its partners ensures access to resources
and expertise necessary for completion of the proposed work. My training in veterinary oncology, clinical trials
and genetics along with guidance from my mentoring team with expertise in genomics, bioinformatics, animal
models and translational oncology make me well positioned for successful transition to independence.

 Decision-making is critical for survival but is a complex process to understand at the level of brain function.
Animals and humans alike can use two strategies to solve problems of decision-making: goal-directed or habitual
behavior. Habits emerge late in training as animals transition from reliance on a goal-directed strategy to a habit
with experience. Biologically, habits are known to develop via communication between a network of areas that
span across the brain. Of particular interest for habit formation are the prefrontal cortex (IL), the sensorimotor
striatum (DLS), dopaminergic projections to the striatum (SNc), and the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA).
Previous work has shown that a characteristic neuronal signature develops in IL and DLS, where as a habit
develops, single-unit neuronal activity accentuates the beginning and end of actions of the behavior as it
becomes well-learned. Importantly, as habits are comprised of multiple components (e.g. efficiency of action
sequences and insensitivity to goal value), these individual features correlate with neural activity in distinct brain
areas across the habit network (IL: outcome devaluation insensitivity, DLS: action vigor). However, there is a
gap in knowledge in how activity in the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) codes habits or how that activity
relates to the function of these other interconnected areas
 The objective of this project is to define how neural activity in CeA contributes to habit formation and
whether a distinct component of behavior correlates with neural activity. The rationale is that the habit network
is conserved across mammals as habits are ubiquitous and the potential for basic research to translate into
bettering the human condition is high. The central hypothesis is that CeA neurons will develop a “chunking”
pattern of activity that is necessary for a habit to develop, with behavioral correlates of this neural activity similar
to those that correlate with IL. Guided by methods and data from Specific Aim 1, where behavioral phenotypes
of habit and methodology to test habit formation are addressed, Specific Aim 2 will, through in-vivo
electrophysiology, determine if CeA activity brackets in a manner similar to IL, DLS, and SNc as a habit forms
on an elevated plus-maze task. Specific Aim 3 details a plan to identify and pursue a postdoctoral research
fellowship upon completion of the dissertation work described in Specific Aim 2. Overall, the proposed
experiment has the potential to provide mental health clinicians and researchers significant insight into how
compulsive actions may arise from improperly timed amygdalar activity and will further define how neural activity
can contribute to psychological phenomena such as habit formation.

The overarching objective of this proposal is to investigate a novel mechanism for sudden unexpected death in
epilepsy (SUDEP). Our laboratory recently made the unexpected discovery that mice genetically engineered for
hyperactive stress circuits exhibit an increased incidence of SUDEP, a finding that was verified to be
translationally relevant from observed neuroendocrine abnormalities in patients that died of confirmed or
suspected SUDEP. Given that both stress and SUDEP link to disruption of central circuits responsible for the
regulation of cardiorespiratory function, we propose that exaggerated activity of central stress circuits on
downstream brainstem autonomic control centers represents a novel mechanism contributing to increased
SUDEP risk. Corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus
(PVN) are at the apex of the stress axis and project directly to brainstem regions critical for autonomic regulation,
including the nucleus of the solitary tract (PVN-NTSCRH). PVN-NTSCRH has a well-established role in integrating
cardiorespiratory responses to stress, making them a likely driver of cardiorespiratory dysfunction related to
central stress axis hyperexcitability and, potentially, SUDEP. In fact, our preliminary data demonstrate that
chemogenetic activation of PVN-NTSCRH increases SUDEP incidence. The current application will build on the
expertise of, Drs. Jamie Maguire and Carie Boychuk, to test the hypothesis that HPA axis hyperexcitability in
chronically epileptic mice increases the risk for SUDEP through increased PVN-NTSCRH drive, exaggerating
cardiac vagal output during homeostatic challenges. We will investigate this hypothesis by examining whether
there is increased PVN-NTSCRH drive associated with SUDEP risk and whether excessive activation of this
pathway is sufficient to increase SUDEP incidence. We will interrogate potential, novel pathophysiological
mechanisms mediating the impact of hyperactive stress circuits on SUDEP risk by examining the impact on
cardiac vagal output. Finally, we will investigate whether environmental factors associated with hyperactive
stress circuits, such as chronic stress, can impact cardiac vagal function and SUDEP risk. This application has
the potential to uncover a novel mechanism contributing to SUDEP risk, which may also be relevant to other
forms of sudden death.

at Tufts University’s Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences (GSBS), BDBS has trained 220 students in the
past 15 years, all of whom have either completed or are still enrolled in undergraduate training. Among those
who have completed college, 129 have entered health-science-related graduate programs. Another 74 have

mentored summer lab experience focused on NHLBI research. A merger of Tufts Medical School with its major
clinical affiliate permits us to increase the number of preceptors – especially those in NHLBI research (from 40
to 52), and we provide them with culturally-aware mentor training. These preceptors are clustered into seven
areas of focus, such that trainees can further learn the value of interdisciplinary collaboration in small groups.
Their lab experience is complemented by Skills Workshops for training in scientific skills that enhance self-
confidence and identity as a scientist. Lunch with a Professor and Meet the Scientist introduce trainees to the
breadth of biomedical science careers and provide career models through interactions with faculty (beyond
their own preceptor), GSBS alumni who are biomedical leaders, BDBS alumni, graduate students, post-
baccalaureate, and postdoctoral scholars. BDBS trainees are housed together close to labs and public
transportation at the Tufts University Medical School residence, building their cohort community, while social
events that include GSBS students, faculty and alumni provide a diverse and welcoming community (25% of
our PhD students are from URG compared to 11% in 2018). A novel aspect of our social events are our
STEAM-based activities (STEM+Art to inspire our trainees to creative thinking), taking advantage of the Tufts
School of the Museum of Fine Arts and an outreach program for near-peer mentoring. By achieving our aims,
BDBS gives trainees the skills and confidence needed to persist and compete effectively for advanced training
positions, and eventually to assume leadership roles in the biomedical workforce. Our record demonstrates
that BDBS is making a strong contribution toward diversifying the biomedical workforce, and we anticipate that
our new approaches will build on this strong foundation to continue enhancing diversity in the biomedicine.

metabolites that influence human health. Characterizing these metabolites and their relationships with major
disease endpoints is critical to elucidate new pathways of risk and corresponding novel preventive and
pharmacologic treatments. Phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan are the three aromatic amino acids (AAA),
centrally involved in protein synthesis and metabolized to a range of bioactive compounds. Gut microbial
enzymes ferment AAA into a plethora of small molecules via deamination, oxidation, and/or reduction. The gut
microbe-derived metabolites can be further metabolized by host liver enzymes before they reach systemic
circulation. Several AAA-derived microbial metabolites have been previously identified as of potential interest
in human health, such as indole-3-propionic acid (I3PA), derived from microbial metabolism of tryptophan and
implicated in diet induced obesity, advanced atherosclerosis, gut permeability, and brain health. However, the
health effects of this and other AAA-derived microbial metabolites remain understudied.
This project resubmission will leverage the power of serial biomarkers measures to investigate the
interrelationships of novel microbiome-generated AAA metabolites with initiation, extent, and clinical onset of
subclinical CVD, clinical CHD, and total mortality. Primary aims include: (1) To investigate the independent
relationships of serial measures of plasma aromatic amino acid (AAA)-derived microbial metabolites with
longitudinal onset and progression of subclinical CVD. (2) To investigate the independent relationships of serial
measures of plasma AAA-derived microbial metabolites with incident CVD events. (3) To investigate the
independent relationships of serial measures of plasma AAA-derived microbial metabolites with total mortality.
Secondary Aims include focuses to investigate (a) the independent dietary, lifestyle, and demographic
predictors of plasma AAA-derived microbial metabolites and change in these metabolites over time in two
diverse community-based populations; and (b) potential effect modification of metabolite-outcome associations
by age, sex, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, background diet, lipid-lowering medication use, renal
function, and prevalent CVD.
This project will provide novel, impactful evidence on how AAA-derived microbial metabolites, measured
serially over time, relate to subclinical CVD, clinical CVD, and mortality in the Multi-Ethnic Study of
Atherosclerosis (MESA; 6,800 middle-aged white, Black, Hispanic, and Chinese adults) and the
Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS; 5,148 older white and Black adults). In pilot work, we have evaluated the
long-term reproducibility of these AAA analytes using serial blood samples collected at baseline (year 2) and 9
years later (year 11) in a random subset of 100 CHS participants.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Project Abstract. Defects in ER protein homeostasis (proteostasis) perturb the ER proteome and lead to the
accumulation of misfolded proteins which is detrimental to the cell. This is underscored by the fact that numerous
human diseases from cystic fibrosis to neurodegeneration are caused by defects in ER proteostasis. Historically,
the field has focused on how ER protein misfolding is sensed and rectified resulting in the detailed
characterization of the unfolded protein response (UPR) and ER-associated degradation (ERAD); pathways that
aim to mitigate protein misfolding. However, whether processes exist that prevent ER protein misfolding in the
first place were largely unknown. Recent studies indicate the presence of a surveillance system that acts during
protein synthesis to tune ER protein translation based on the status of the ER proteome. This process, termed
pre-emptive ER quality control relies on local regulation of translation at the ribosome to modulate the biogenesis
of ER proteins and ubiquitin dependent degradation of misfolded proteins prior to ER insertion. Therefore, pre-
emptive ER quality control oversees translation to prevent folding defects. Because this system is powerful way
to maintain a pristine ER proteome without eliciting the UPR or ERAD, mechanisms that activate this process
may be pursued to advance therapies for a variety of diseases caused by protein misfolding. However, we do
not know the identity of the molecules or mechanisms regulating pre-emptive ER quality control. This level of
understanding is critical to develop a framework understanding how ER proteostasis defects cause disease.
 In ongoing studies in my lab, we have found that UBXN1 is a new modulator of pre-emptive ER quality
control. UBXN1 is best studied as an adaptor to the p97 ATPase, a critical player in ERAD and a major research
focus of my group. In cells lacking UBXN1 we find a significant upregulation of many ER proteins and robust
activation of the unfolded protein response. Our studies suggest that UBXN1 represses translation. Surprisingly,
UBXN1 does not function in ERAD and its role in translation is independent of p97. The objective of this proposal
is to characterize this new role of UBXN1 as a pre-emptive ER quality control factor. We will test the central
hypothesis that UBXN1 interacts with unique ribosomal proteins in a ubiquitin-dependent manner to regulate the
specific translation of ER proteins. We will further investigate the pathway through which translation impacts
UPR activation. In Aim 1 we will identify the mechanisms by which UBXN1 regulates translation, in Aim 2 we will
delineate the pathway through which UBXN1 represses the UPR, and in Aim 3 we determine whether UBXN1
enables selective translation of ER proteins. The proposed work is conceptually innovative as we do not fully
understand how preemptive ER quality control is regulated. This work is of significance because we will define
how UBXN1 maintains ER proteostasis by modulating translation. Successful completion of these studies will
position UBXN1 as an important regulator of protein translation and provide molecular-level insight into how
modulating translation can maintain ER proteostasis and protect against disease.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Schistosomes are parasitic flatworms that cause a chronic, debilitating disease afflicting
>200 million people in >70 countries. The parasites live for years in what should be a very
hostile environment – the blood of vertebrates – yet they appear to elicit little if any
damaging responses from the host’s hemostatic systems. We hypothesize that proteins at
the host-interactive surface, identified in the previous funding cycle, are central to this
ability. In this competing renewal, we propose to test several key hypotheses concerning:
1) the hemostatic roles of tegumental ectoenzymes SmNPP5 & SmATPDase in vitro and
in vivo, 2) the ability of tegumental ectoenzymes SmAP & NACE to generate key nutrients
- adenosine and nicotinamide respectively - that are vital for schistosome survival and
growth and 3) the ability of tegumental calpain to impede coagulation, promote
thrombolysis and to block local thrombus formation in vivo. These studies aim to reveal the
physiological functions of these proteins and will yield significant new information on the
molecular mechanisms used by schistosomes to blunt both arms of the host thrombotic
response (platelet function and the coagulation cascade) while maintaining access to vital
nutrients. In addition, the work may identify tegumental proteins critical for parasite survival
leading to subsequent screens to discover potential schistosome-killing drugs that inhibit
these molecules and/or to trials testing their vaccine potential. In this way, our planned
experiments have the potential to reveal novel and valid targets, as well as new
treatments, for intervention in a parasite that remains a widespread and major cause of
human disease. Additionally, given wide interest in understanding the mechanisms
governing coagulation control, knowing how schistosomes regulate this process will be of
interest beyond the field of eukaryotic pathogen research.

Microfold (M) cells are specialized cells of the intestinal epithelium that are concentrated in the epithelium lying
over the lymph follicles, called the follicle associated epithelium (FAE). M cells are designed to deliver antigens
to underlying lymph tissues. Their specialized function is facilitated both by a host of receptors on their apical
surface that bind to antigens and particles and their ability to rapidly transcytose these bound antigens from the
apical surface to the basolateral surface where they are captured by immune cells within the Peyer’s patches.
M cells are also exploited as cellular portals by many enteric bacterial and viral pathogens to gain access to
the lymph system, including the bacterial pathogen Yersinia pseudotuberculosis (Yptb). In our previous work,
we established a differentiated human ileum organoid model system on Transwells and induced M cell
development in order to study molecular mechanistic interactions between Yptb and M cells. We found that
Yptb that are not expressing the type III secretion system (T3SS) are internalized by M cells and found in the
basolateral chamber in high numbers. By contrast, Yptb that are expressing the T3SS remained bound on the
extracellular surface of M cells and induced M cell extrusion from the monolayer. Strikingly, YopE, a T3SS
effector protein, caused extrusion of M cell from the monolayer. Thus, we hypothesize that oral infection of
mice with Yptb leads to transient M cell depletion due to the YopE RhoA-GAP activity and this M cell depletion
limits superinfection by other pathogens and re-infection by Yptb. The objectives of this application are two-
fold. (1) We will use our expertise in murine infection models and determine if infection with WT-Yptb and a
type III secretion mutant, yscNU, impacts the numbers and functions of M cells in the follicle associated
epithelium. (2) We will build murine organoid/enteroid cell lines that express Cas9 only in developing M cells
and then exploit CRISPR-Cas9 techniques to selectively delete RhoA and other putative Yop targets in M cells.
This will permit us to evaluate the roles of the proteins targeted for inactivation by Yops in M cell homeostasis
and functions. By building these tools and establishing that Yptb infection depletes M cells, we will have a firm
basis to investigate the molecular mechanistic and immunological implications of Yptb-M cell interactions in a
planned R01 proposal.

CD14 is a coreceptor that facilitates the innate immune responses triggered by a broad range of pathogen-
derived molecules and host damage-derived danger signals. These properties, which contribute to the rapid
mobilization of the immune system, can also contribute to the exacerbation of inflammatory immune
responses, particularly when tissue damage is extensive. Because of this, CD14 is an attractive target for the
modulation of the 'cytokine storms' associated with severe bacterial sepsis, cancer immunotherapies, and the
acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) that is seen in severe cases of COVID-19. Tumor necrosis factor
(TNFα) is one of the most prominent inflammatory cytokines associated with these storms, and TNFα-blocking
biologicals have proven useful in treating these inflammatory syndromes. However, we currently lack therapies
for the persistent immune paralysis associated with sepsis and ARDS. Here, we build on recent findings from
our collaborators, who have extended the in vitro coreceptor-like functions of CD14 to the death domain-
containing receptors FAS and TNFR1. This is clinically significant, because it suggests that CD14 participates
in the induction of inflammatory cytokines and in the effector responses set in motion by those very cytokines.
Further studies established that CD14 and TRIF are required for the induction of lethal sepsis by TNFα. In
conjunction with in vitro biochemical data, these findings indicate that CD14 modulates the signals initiated by
TNFR1 in precisely the same way that it augments LPS-induced signals: by engaging endosomal signaling
pathways that act via TRAM, TRIF, TBK1, and IRF3 to promote type-I interferon production and inflammatory
cell death. Thus, CD14 may contribute to septic immunoparalysis by inducing the death of immune cells
exposed to FasL or TNFα. For this reason, it is crucial to understand how CD14 interacts with these receptors.
However, these receptors do not share ligands, and CD14, which is a GPI-anchored protein, lacks the
transmembrane and cytoplasmic regions typically associated with signaling effectors. Via an exhaustive
analysis of the evolutionary histories of CD14, TNFα, and TNFR1, we identified features that appear to have
coevolved in placental mammals and that could plausibly link CD14 to TNFα/TNFR1 complexes. In order to
clarify how CD14 contributes to septic phenomena in vivo, this proposal will evaluate the hypothesized link
between CD14 and TNFα/TNFR1 complexes (Aim 1), and will determine whether CD14 promotes sepsis via
cell-intrinsic signaling events occurring in myeloid cells and/or stromal tissues (Aim 2). These efforts are
intended to rapidly narrow the scope of future enquiry by identifying viable mechanisms with the greatest
explanatory power. In so doing, this work will set the stage for examinations of these pathways in vivo.

Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its receptor TrkB play essential roles in the central regulation
of energy and glucose homeostasis. BDNF signaling greatly influences many aspects of neuronal function,
including survival, differentiation and synaptic plasticity and transmission. Deficits in BDNF function have been
linked to over feeding and severe obesity in humans and mice. Accordingly, we showed that mice with BDNF
depletion in the brain (BDNF2L/2LCk-cre) exhibit increased food intake, obesity, insulin resistance and
dyslipidemia. Diminished a2d-1 (Cacna2d1) function in ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) of BDNF2L/2LCk-cre
mice contributes to the metabolic alterations that they exhibit. In support, viral-mediated rescue of deficient
a2d-1 expression in the VMH of BDNF2L/2LCk-cre mice mitigated their hyperphagia and obesity. Importantly, it
dramatically improved hepatic lipid accumulation and normalized deficits in glycemic control even though
rescued mutants remained significantly heavier than wild type controls. Furthermore, a2d-1 knock down in the
adult VMH resulted in susceptibility to diet-induced obesity (DIO). a2d-1 serves as a receptor for astrocyte-
derived thrombospondins (TSP) to mediate excitatory synapse assembly. Electrophysiological analysis
indicates that the metabolic effects of a2d-1 are related changes in the excitatory tone onto VMH neurons,
implicating thrombospondin signaling. This project will test the hypothesis that TSP/a2d-1 signaling in the
VMH facilitates synaptic remodeling during conditions of positive energy balance to increase the excitatory
drive onto neurons mediating energy, glucose and lipid homeostasis. Aim 1 will determine how gain or loss
of a2d-1 function in the adult VMH affects metabolic function and mechanisms activated by a2d-1 that prevent
hepatic steatosis and glucose intolerance during obesogenic conditions. Aim 2 will examine the effects of gain
or loss of astrocytic TSP function in the adult VMH in the regulation of metabolic function and whether these
effects are a2d-1-dependent. Aim 3 will determine whether a2d-1 and TSP mediates the effects of caloric
status on the excitatory synaptic physiology and activity of VMH neurons. Finally, Aim 4 will map the
connectivity of VMH a2d-1+ neurons, examine their responses to caloric signals in vivo and the effects of
stimulating or inhibiting these cells on metabolic function. Findings from this project will inform novel
mechanisms facilitating metabolic health in individuals who are persistently overweight and new targets for
the treatment of metabolic dysfunction. Importantly, they have the potential to inform pathological
mechanisms underlying metabolic disturbances in individuals administered the anti-epileptic and anti-
nociceptive drugs gabapentin and pregabalin, which bind and inhibit a2d-1.

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the US, accounting for approximately 22% of all cancer
deaths. Annual screening with low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) is recommended in adults aged 50-80
years who have a history of pack-years to 20 and are current smokers or quit in the past 15 years, but
screening with LDCT remains controversial due to the very high false-positive rates, increased radiation
exposures, and costs. Moreover, many adults are diagnosed with lung cancer who are not eligible for
screening. In the 2021 USPSTF recommendation statement, the task force identified “Future Research
Needs,” which includes conducting more research on biomarkers, noting that: “Biomarkers could potentially be
used to identify high-risk candidates for screening with LDCT”. For this project, we propose to measure DNA
methylation levels in blood leukocytes obtained from samples that were collected prior to screening (and at
multiple time points) in participants of the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST). Our first objective is to
develop a pre-screening tool that would classify high-risk participants into additional risk categories to reduce
number of scans needed. Our second objective is to examine whether differences in DNA methylation markers
can distinguish participants with positive screening results who developed lung cancer from those with false
positives (i.e., did not develop cancer). Our third objective is to examine whether differences in DNA
methylation markers can discriminate participants who had a negative scan and were diagnosed with lung
cancer during follow-up and through the end of 2014 from those with a negative scan who did not develop lung
cancer. Using the NLST archived samples will allow us to efficiently evaluate whether DNA methylation
markers can improve models for risk stratification, thus reduce unnecessary scans needed to be performed, as
well as potentially assist in identifying true positive and false negative LDCT scans.

This application seeks continued support for a new project, based on discoveries made during a research
program, funded by the NCI for over 45 years, on biology and evolution of retroviruses and their roles in AIDS
and cancer, with a particular focus on Human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs). The studies described in this
proposal will ccenter on a provirus in the relatively recent HERV-K (HML-2) group that integrated in a site on
chromosome 3, band q12.3 of a common human/gorilla ancestor at least 8 million years ago. In prior work, we
discovered that this provirus has several unique features consistent with its having evolved into a restriction
factor capable of strongly blocking the virion assembly step in replication both of the reconstructed, infectious,
HERV-Kcon and, remarkably, also of HIV. Adaptations to this role include an LTR mutation that leads to
widespread expression in all normal human solid tissues and a mutation (or mutations) in the gag CA encoding
region that lead to transdominant misassembly of the Gag precursor of the infecting virus at the cell membrane.
The current proposal will follow up on these observations with the aims of obtaining a detailed understanding
of the mechanism of co assembly and inhibition of HIV Gag assembly and release, understanding the evolution
of the 3q12.3 provirus and the scope of its activity against other retroviruses, isolation of HIV escape mutants
resistant to 3q12.3 inhibition, and testing the feasibility of using reactivation of the 3q12.3 provirus in HIV target
cells as a novel method of prevention of HIV replication.

patients with B cell malignancies that are refractory to standard treatment. Numerous clinical trials are focused
on improvements of the approach and applications for a much broader range of hematologic malignancies and
solid tumors. However, this targeted therapy is also associated with high relapse rates and the development of
severe toxicities that are challenging to predict. Thus, improved tools to optimize and monitor response are
critically needed. Our ultimate goal is to develop a simple, quantitative, and non-invasive point-of-care device to
monitor CAR-T cell interactions in vivo dynamically with the needed frequency. The objective of this proposal is
to demonstrate proof-of-principle of the approach and its translational potential for human studies. Our approach
relies on in vivo flow cytometry (IVFC) assessments using endogenous and exogenous sources of optical
contrast and its optimization and use to detect CAR-T/B cell interactions in vitro and in vivo. The proposed
method relies on the confocal detection of endogenous light scattering and fluorescence (label-free or LF) signals
of flowing CAR-T/B cells that are interacting. Previous studies support the hypothesis that interacting CAR-T/B
cells will likely yield unique optical signatures. We anticipate that utilization of advanced signal processing
approaches will enable us to optimize detection of these signals in the challenging milieu of flowing blood in vitro
and in vivo. Initial measurements with fluorescent protein (FP)-expressing human CAR-T and B cells spiked in
whole blood will allow us to develop, implement, and assess enhancements in hardware and software to realize
accurate LF-IVFC assessments of interacting CAR-T and B cells. (Aim 1.1). The translational potential will be
tested on blood samples isolated from patients undergoing CAR-T cell therapy at different time points over the
first month of therapy. We expect to detect variations in the numbers of interacting CAR-T and B cells using LF-
IVFC and this expectation will be corroborated with antibody-based flow cytometry measurements (Aim 1.2).
Finally, we will perform in vivo LF and FP-based IVFC measurements using mice infused with human B
lymphoblasts and CAR-T cells at concentrations known to induce variations in the relative circulating levels of
these cells. Our goal will be to demonstrate that LF-IVFC measurements can be performed with high enough

to generate a robust set of data that will motivate development and application of LF-IVFC monitoring of
interacting CAR-T/B cells for dynamic, non-invasive monitoring of patients receiving CAR-T cell therapy. Such a
device may enable acquisition of information regarding individual patient responses with a combined time
resolution and sensitivity/specificity that is not possible to achieve currently. We anticipate such data will yield a
novel paradigm for patient monitoring to optimize response and identify patients that may need more timely
interventions to optimize outcomes.

Much of the world’s music has periodic rhythms with events repeating regularly in time, to which people clap,
move, and sing. The ability to detect and predict periodic auditory rhythms is central to the positive effects of
music-based therapies on a variety of neurological disorders, including improving phonological processing in
dyslexia, enhancing language recovery after stroke, and normalizing gait in Parkinson’s disease. Yet the neural
mechanisms underlying rhythm perception are not well understood, and progress is impeded by the lack of an
animal model that allows precise measurement and manipulation of neural circuits during rhythm perception.
Human neuroimaging studies indicate that perceiving periodic musical rhythms strongly engages the motor
planning system, including premotor cortex and basal ganglia, even when the listener is not moving or preparing
to move. Here, we test the hypothesis that the motor planning system is actively involved in learning to recognize
temporal periodicity and communicates predictions about the timing of periodic events to the auditory system.
We propose to take advantage of the well-described auditory-motor circuits in vocal learning songbirds and
leverage the mechanistic studies possible in an animal model to test these ideas. Like humans (and unlike non-
human primates), vocal learning birds have strong connections between motor planning regions and auditory
regions due to their reliance on complex, learned vocal sequences for communication. Auditory-motor circuits in
songbirds and humans have many structural and functional parallels. Recently, we showed that songbirds can
readily learn to recognize a fundamental periodic pattern (isochrony, or equal timing between events) and can
detect this pattern across a broad range of tempi. In Aim 1, we will test whether neural signals from premotor
regions play a causal role in this ability to flexibly recognize periodic rhythms. In Aim 2, by recording in auditory
cortex while reversibly silencing activity in a reciprocally connected premotor region, we will test whether
premotor signals influence auditory processing of periodic rhythms. In Aim 3, by recording activity in a premotor
region as birds learn to recognize isochrony as a global temporal pattern, we will determine whether premotor
neurons develop sensitivity to temporal regularity and exhibit activity that predicts the timing of upcoming events.
Establishing an animal model for rhythm perception will be transformative for music neuroscience, allowing
detailed investigation of the neural mechanisms underlying rhythm perception and informing rhythm-based
musical interventions to enhance function in normal and disease states.

Chemotherapy remains the standard of care for patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), which
affects 20% of patients with breast cancer. However, 50% of patients with localized TNBC treated with
neoadjuvant chemotherapy display residual cancer burden after treatment and up to 25% of patients who
receive this treatment will suffer metastatic recurrence within five years. The poor association between
chemotherapy and patient outcome emphasizes two major problems for TNBC patients: chemoresistance,
where tumor cells within the local environment are protected and do not die in response to chemotherapy, and
chemotherapy-induced metastasis, where chemotherapy-induced changes in tumor intrinsic properties and the
tumor microenvironment drive invasion which leads to recurrence. Previous studies have demonstrated that
cell migration and extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling are associated with chemoresistant TNBC. The goal
of this proposal is to understand the mechanisms by which the ECM contributes to chemoresistance and
chemotherapy-induced metastasis in TNBC.
We provide preliminary data that individual proteins upregulated in TNBC tumors drive resistance to
chemotherapy drug Paclitaxel and that expression of Cathepsin B (CTSB), a protease which degrades these
ECM proteins into small fragments, protects against the development of chemoresistance. We will dissect the
mechanism by which the protease CTSB and the ECM proteins it degrades influence response to Paclitaxel in
TNBC and whether these fragments can be used to track and target chemoresistance in vivo. We have also
found that chemotherapy treatment leads to changes in the ECM composition of mammary tumors.
Specifically, Paclitaxel treatment leads to an increased abundance of Collagen IV, an ECM protein which
promote invasion and metastasis in TNBC. Our goal is to determine the cell types that secrete ECM proteins
such as Collagen IV after chemotherapy treatment, determine the contribution of these ECM proteins to
chemotherapy-induced metastasis, and whether these pathways can be targeted to prevent the development
of recurrence.
Upon successful completion of the proposed research, our contribution is expected to be an understanding of
how ECM proteins upregulated in TNBC tumors contribute to chemoresistance and how chemotherapy alters
the ECM to promote recurrence and metastatic dissemination. These contributions will be significant because
all TNBC patients receive chemotherapy and metastatic recurrence is a current unmet clinical need. Results
from these studies will provide novel conceptual insights on mechanisms of chemoresistance and
chemotherapy-induced metastasis and will allow us to develop new strategies to track, predict and overcome
chemoresistance in TNBC.

The focus of my lab is to understand the mechanisms of genome instability caused by structure-prone
DNA repeats. We are particularly interested in the mechanisms of repeat expansions that are responsible
for over fifty hereditary diseases in humans. Recent advances in long-read sequencing revealed a new
paradigm: massive genome-wide expansions of structure-prone DNA repeats in human cancers. Thus,
understanding the mechanisms responsible for large-scale repeat expansions is fundamentally important
and has broad biomedical implications.
My lab was the first to show that expandable DNA repeats stall replication fork progression in every
experimental system studied, including bacteria, yeast, and human cells. This led us to propose that
repeats can be added while replication fork escapes from a “repetitive trap”. We first confirmed this idea in
a yeast experimental system. Depending on the mode of replication fork progression through a repeat,
expansions occur by incorporation of unprocessed flaps during Okazaki fragments maturation, replicative
or post-replicative template-switching, or break-induced replication. Recently, we developed a new
experimental system to study large-scale expansions in human cells, which implicates DNA replication as
well. Repeat expansions also occur in terminally differentiated somatic cells that do not undergo DNA
replication. We have, therefore, adjusted our experimental system to study repeat expansions in non-
dividing yeast cells. Our results point to DNA nick repair as a possible mechanism.
We plan to move our research in several directions. First, we will elucidate the role of DNA nick repair in
expansions of Friedreich’s ataxia (FRDA) (GAA)n repeats in dividing and non-dividing yeast cells by
introducing targeted nicks with Cas9 nickases. We will establish its genetic controls and study the role of
the human FAN1 nuclease expressed in yeast. Second, we will unravel the mechanisms of large-scale
repeat expansions in human cells by conducting candidate gene analysis in a plasmid system utilizing
SV40 replication machinery. We will also study the effects of compounds that disrupt or stabilize DNA triplexes
formed by these repeats on their replication and expansion. We will further extend our studies into a different
system based on the EBNA1-dependent replication which involves regular cellular replication fork. Third, we will
carry out structure-functional analysis of other expandable homopurine-homopyrimidine repeats, including the
(AAGGG)n repeat, which is responsible for cerebellar ataxia, neuropathy, vestibular areflexia syndrome
(CANVAS), the (CCCTCT)n repeat that modifies the expressivity of X-linked dystonia parkinsonism (XDP), and
the (GAAA)n repeat, which recurrently expands in many human cancers. At present, there are no data on DNA
structures formed by those repeats or on the mechanisms of their expansions. We will address these matters by
using the broad arsenal of methods and experimental systems developed and existing in the lab.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Project Summary
Physical activity has been associated with several chronic disease markers for the past 25 years, and
countless studies have tested interventions to improve physical activity of sedentary populations. Most of these
intervention studies have attempted to improve physical activity behaviors by changing individual level drivers
of activity, like motivation, attitudes, and self-efficacy for being active. Unfortunately, these efforts to change
activity levels are often not sustained beyond the initial intervention period. One possible cause of this lack of
sustainability is that insufficient attention was paid to environmental factors that facilitate physical activity.
Thus, attention is shifting to more complex environmental and social contributions to physical activity, with the
aim of identifying multi-level strategies to better target interventions to groups that need help. Very few tests of
changing environment levels to increase physical activity exist in the literature. A focus on interventions at
environmental levels, as called for by recent reviews as well as reports from the Institute of Medicine, might
provide the long-term sustainable change that is needed to change physical activity in low-income populations.
This project seeks to test a new multi-level, multi-component package to increase moderate intensity physical
activity levels of people living in public housing developments. Our aims are to evaluate the effects of an
intervention package focused on the environment level to produce changes in moderate physical activity
among public housing residents. Furthermore, we will evaluate the added effects of an efficacy-tested
individual-level eHealth phone program to produce further changes in moderate intensity physical activity. The
design of this study is a prospective, cluster randomized controlled trial, with housing developments as the
units of randomization. In this four group, factorial, cluster randomized controlled trial, we will compare an
environmental intervention alone (E only), an individual intervention alone (I only), an environmental plus
individual intervention (E+I), all against a control group. Mediation and moderation of our intervention will be
assessed. Lastly, we will assess factors from the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research
domains to examine future implementation of a multi-level physical activity intervention among key informants in
public housing developments.

Human babesiosis caused by the hemoparasite Babesia microti is an emerging tick-borne disease in the
United States. Symptoms include fever, chills, sweats, headache, myalgia and anorexia. In young and healthy
individuals, symptoms tend to be few and mild. In individuals >50 years of age and in immunocompromised
patients, symptoms can be severe and hospital admission required. Despite medical care, complications such
as severe anemia, adult respiratory distress syndrome and renal insufficiency or failure can develop. Death is
the outcome in 2-3% of hospitalized cases. Prophylaxis is limited to endemic area avoidance and tick exposure
reduction. These measures have been ineffective in curtailing the emergence of babesiosis. No vaccine is
available and no chemoprophylaxis has been tested for babesiosis. Tafenoquine is approved for pre-exposure
prophylaxis of malaria and radical cure of Plasmodium vivax infection. The prophylactic regimen consists of a
loading dose taken for three consecutive days followed by a weekly maintenance dose until one week after
travel. The therapeutic regimen is a single dose taken along with chloroquine. Tafenoquine has never been
tested as prophylaxis for babesiosis. Pre-clinical studies indicate that i) prompt resolution of B. microti infection
is achieved by single dose tafenoquine but ii) radical cure is attained only if tafenoquine is administered over
several consecutive days. In a recent case report, we were the first to document the therapeutic benefit of
tafenoquine in an elderly immunocompromised patient who suffered from relapsing babesiosis in the context of
broad antimicrobial resistance. Cure was achieved following initiation of tafenoquine. We hypothesize that
tafenoquine can be used for the prophylaxis of babesiosis, including when the host immune response is
weakened by advanced age or severe immune suppression. In Aim #1, we will use the DBA/2J mouse strain to
model the severe babesiosis of old age. We will initiate our studies by infecting young DBA/2J mice and, in
doing so, identify regimens that offer a prospect of conferring prophylaxis in old age. Briefly, we will administer
tafenoquine for three consecutive days during the “window period”, starting on day 3 post-infection. We will
monitor the course of parasitemia from its onset (day 7) until day 35 post-infection. We will ascertain whether
radical cure is achieved by adoptive transfer of blood to rag-deficient mice. We identify the protective regimen
that uses the lowest daily dose and test whether this regimen confers prophylaxis to old DBA/2J mice. We will
detect tafenoquine in plasma by use of LC/MS/MS and identify the maximal concentration and the overall drug
exposure required for prophylaxis in young and old DBA/2J mice. In Aim #2, we will use young rag-deficient
BALB/c mice to model severe immune suppression. We will test whether prophylaxis of rag-deficient mice
requires a daily dose higher than those used for prophylaxis of young and old DBA/2J mice. If successful, the
work will lay the ground for a clinical trial that will test tafenoquine for post-exposure prophylaxis of babesiosis.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：ABSTRACT
 Two clinical measures are currently used to stage chronic kidney disease (CKD), the estimated glomerular
filtration rate (eGFR) and urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR). The elevated morbidity and mortality risk that
is experienced by persons with CKD is overwhelmingly a result of progressive atherosclerotic cardiovascular
disease (ASCVD) and heart failure (HF) rather than kidney failure. Unfortunately, eGFR and ACR inadequately
depict the kidney’s complexity because they represent glomerular function and injury respectively; yet the
kidney is predominantly comprised of tubules, and the kidney tubules are responsible for myriad homeostatic
functions that likely have more direct influence on the cardiovascular system than does damage to the
glomerulus. Moreover, pathology studies have convincingly demonstrated that tubule damage is more
prognostic for loss of kidney function than glomerular scarring.
 Novel urine measures that quantify the health of the kidney tubules have recently allowed us to define four
additional dimensions of kidney health that independently influence risk for progressive CKD: proximal tubule
injury, proximal tubule function, tubule fibrosis and repair, and tubule synthetic function. Our team has selected
eight distinct urine measures that capture each of these four dimensions and comprise the Kidney Tubule
Health Panel (KTHP). In specific, high-risk populations, the KTHP dimensions are strongly associated with risk
for ASCVD, HF and mortality; but no studies have evaluated the contributions of kidney tubule health to the
development of ASCVD and HF in the general population. Our global hypothesis is that kidney tubule damage
and dysfunction are related to the onset and progression of ASCVD and HF.
 Within two well-established, general population cohorts, CARDIA and MESA, this proposal will address the
following research questions that are critical to understanding the development of each dimension of kidney
tubule disease and their role in promoting ASCVD and HF: 1) Does kidney tubule disease develop earlier and
progress faster with advancing age than ACR and eGFR? 2) Is kidney tubule disease more severe in Black
and Hispanic persons compared with White persons? 3) Which atherosclerotic risk factors have the strongest
associations with each dimension of kidney tubule disease? 4) How strongly associated is kidney tubule
disease with several subclinical CVD measures? 5) How strongly associated are kidney tubule disease
markers with ASCVD and HF, and do they improve prediction of these endpoints? If these Aims are
successful, these easily measured, non-invasive indices of kidney tubule health may have value for population
screening, to provide insights into race/ethnic differences in kidney and cardiovascular disease, and to
identifying pathways for novel therapeutics that target kidney tubules, such as the SGLT2 inhibitors and the
non-steroidal aldosterone antagonists, that reduce risk for both kidney and cardiovascular adverse outcomes.

Athymic patients, or those born without a thymus, have a complete absence of functional T cells; such patients
will die within the first two years of life without functional T cells from complications associated with
immunodeficiency. There are several causes of athymia, including 22q11.2 deletion (i.e., DiGeorge Syndrome),
which is estimated to occur in 1 in 3,000 to 6,000 live births with reports suggesting even higher prenatally (as
frequent as 1 in 992). Roughly 0.5-1% of these patients have a complete lack of T cells called Complete
DiGeorge. These patients all require a thymic implant to restore T cells in their immune system to prevent death.
Current treatment approaches rely on harvesting primary tissue from children during open-heart procedures, an
approach that is not scalable and is limited by scarcity of tissues. Moreover, supply is further limited as there
must be minimal HLA matching between donor and recipient, which may contribute to post-thymus implant
autoimmunity. Thymmune Therapeutics, Inc. (“Thymmune”) has developed proprietary insights in thymic
differentiation from pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and is using this knowledge to develop a cell-based
therapy (“THY-001”) for patients with athymia that addresses the key issues associated with current
treatment methods (i.e., collection and availability of tissues). The Thymmune team has a collective 100+
years of drug development experience to support this effort. Importantly, our previous development work has
shown that upon transplantation, our thymic epithelial progenitor cells (TEPs) differentiate in vivo into thymic
epithelial cells (TECs), forming thymic like tissues, though the composition of these grafts are variable. In this
SBIR Fast Track proposal, Thymmune will improve upon its existing protocol to produce its TEPs in a scalable
and reproducible manner necessary for clinical applications and establish the thymopoietic potential of this
therapy in vivo for the treatment of athymia. In Phase I, we will develop a differentiation protocol for TEPs in full
suspension conditions to enable industrial scale-up of THY-001 and derive a set of biomarkers that can be used
to define the cell product in anticipation of regulatory requirements for taking THY-001 into the clinic. In Phase II
work, we will test the in vivo function of the iPSC-TEPs that we have developed following our optimized protocol
developed in Phase I. Also in Phase II, we will develop a protocol for thymic engraftment in skeletal muscle
transplantation since current practices for thymic cell tissue therapy experiments in animals transplant tissue
directly into the subrenal capsule, which is not a clinically viable site. This SBIR Fast Track proposal will
establish the necessary protocols for commercial production of TEPs, determine their efficacy in vivo,
and establish a translatable method for transplantation to advance THY-001, Thymmune’s stem-cell
derived thymic cell therapy to treat patients with athymia. Following this work, we will test our cell product
in large pre-clinical animal model and prepare for submission of pre-IND and IND applications.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Molecularly targeted cancer therapies, such as Abl-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), have
converting many terminal cancers, including chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), into chronic diseases.
Despite the targeted approach, vascular toxicities have emerged. Specifically, the first-generation CML
TKI imatinib is safe, yet newer generation TKIs frequently used for resistant CML (nilotinib, dasatinib,
ponatinib) confer a 2-5 fold increased risk of arterial thrombosis causing MI, stroke, or limb ischemia.
With no validated models to test for vascular toxicity prior to drug approval, this side effect was identified
only when adverse events accrued and once recognized, there are no data to guide clinicians as to how
to prevent this or to treat these cancer survivors. This proposal addresses these gaps in knowledge by
leveraging the CML TKIs, a drug class with both safe and toxic members. We and others showed that
toxic CML TKIs damage ECs in some in vitro models and enhance atherosclerosis in mice. As CML
patients with underlying CV risk factors are predisposed to toxicity, we hypothesize that the toxic CML
drugs impair specific endothelial cell (EC) functions that lead to plaque development, inflammation,
rupture, thrombosis and ischemia. As these drugs are kinase inhibitors, we further posit that the toxicity
is caused by modulation of the phosphorylation state of signaling proteins in a manner that is deleterious
to EC function and have shown this using proteomic approaches. Thus, we now propose to test the
hypothesis that toxic CML TKIs act on ECs to impair barrier integrity, enhance leukocyte trafficking, slow
wound healing, and increase interaction with platelets, thereby promoting an atherosclerosis phenotype
prone to rupture and thrombosis, and that the drug-induced EC proteomic profile can predict vascular
toxicity and identify mitigating treatments. We test this with 2 aims using multiple innovative approaches:
SA1 interrogates the impact of each CML TKI using human engineered microvessels (hEMVs) to
examine the impact on vascular permeability and platelet aggregation and in mice using intravital
microscopy to quantify leukocyte-EC interaction, carotid wire injury to measure vascular re-
endothelialization, and Apo-E-KO mice with FACS to quantify vascular inflammation in atherosclerosis.
SA2 uses a targeted mass spectrometry based phosphoproteomic assay to profile the effects of emerging
CML TKIs and a broad range of drugs approved for CV disease in human ECs to determine if this can
predict toxicity of new TKIs and identify mitigating therapies. Predicted toxicities and “antidotes” that
oppose the toxic proteomic signature will be tested using the in vitro and in vivo models described in SA1.
Completion of the aims will transform cardiooncology by validating preclinical models to predict vascular
safety of CML TKIs and identify potential treatments for vascular toxicity that can be rapidly translated to
cardiooncology care.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Excessive sugar and fat consumption can lead to a range of metabolic abnormalities including non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), hypercholesterolemia, dyslipidemia, obesity, and insulin resistance. Emerging evidence points to a new mechanism linking carbon metabolism and fatty liver disease to the G protein-coupled Protease Activated Receptor-2 (PAR2), a receptor previously known to be involved in inflammation. To provide key support for the potential importance of hepatic PAR2 in humans, in a cross-sectional study of liver specimens and clinical data from 108 NAFLD patients and controls, we found that PAR2 protein expression in hepatocytes was low in control livers and progressively increased in patients with mild NAFLD fibrosis and in NAFLD with higher stages of fibrosis. The high PAR2-expressing NAFLD patient cohort had significantly elevated plasma LDL cholesterol as compared to the low PAR2-expressing cohort. However, a definitive role for PAR2 in metabolism, cholesterol homeostasis, and liver pathology remains unknown. The overarching goal of this grant proposal is to examine the role of PAR2 signaling in the etiology and pathogenesis of fatty liver disease to test our central hypothesis that hepatic PAR2 is a novel contributor of hypertriglyceridemia, obesity, and insulin resistance. PAR2 is expressed by many tissues and cell types and a conventional mouse whole-body knockout (KO) has been used to date. Therefore, it is unclear how much of the KO phenotype or effects of PAR2 inhibition on steatosis, lipid metabolism, and weight loss is mediated only at the level of the hepatocyte and how much is due to loss of PAR2 at other sites of expression. We will use our new hepatocyte-specific PAR2-KO, PAR2∆Hep mice to define and validate the specific involvement of liver PAR2 in these profound metabolic effects in aims 1-3. It is unclear how PAR2 promotes insulin resistance in diet-induced obesity models. Aim 2 will explore a novel mechanism whereby PAR2 activates a Gq-PLC pathway to stimulate calcium flux and CaMKK2 to interfere in insulin activation of AKT-glucose signaling. To explain our preliminary data that global PAR2-deficiency lowers basal plasma glucose, but increases liver glucose and glycogen in both lean and obese mouse models, Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that hepatocyte PAR2 suppresses the major liver glucose transporter GLUT2 through a mechanism potentially involving Gq-MAPK-FoxA3. Aims 1-3 will utilize our pepducin technology developed to allosterically target G-protein coupled receptors on the inside surface of the plasma membrane to help delineate specific PAR2-effector signaling pathways in aberrant liver metabolism and insulin resistance in vitro and in vivo.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Accurate assessment of kidney function is fundamental to the care of all patients, but current methods to
estimate GFR have error rates of 35-60% in important populations as well as variable accuracy across race,
ethnicity and geography, leading to errors in critical decisions, drug dosing, and determination of prognosis.
Current GFR estimates include a coefficient for Black vs non-Black which may restrict access to care. As a
result, there are critical knowledge gaps in evaluation and management of GFR in health and disease.
Our goal is to develop a valid and robust GFR estimate optimized for an individual person that meets the
critical unmet need for a confirmatory test. The confirmatory test will use a panel of endogenous filtration
markers to estimate GFR (peGFR) from a single blood sample using an equation that does not require serum
creatinine or demographic characteristics. Our research team has extensive experience in biomarker
evaluation, GFR estimation, epidemiology, laboratory science and metabolomics. Our preliminary data
provide proof of concept that a panel of novel metabolites that does not include serum creatinine or
demographics can eliminate bias and greatly improve precision of GFR estimates in patients with heart failure
and reduced muscle mass; and that novel techniques can be used to produce a high-accuracy and
parsimonious prediction model.
Aim 1 Using global metabolomic discovery (~1000+ metabolites) on five cohorts (N=2583), we will select
candidate metabolites based on maximal joint association with mGFR as well as biological and physiological
assessment of their properties as filtration markers. Markers that show acceptable analytical properties in initial
testing will be incorporated into a liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometer (LC-MS/MS) multiplex
assay. Aim 2: We propose to use a spectrum of novel approaches, such as marginalizing predictions to down-
weight outlier metabolites and kernel nearest neighbor weighted average predictions, to maximize precision as
well as robustness across multiple diverse populations and to compare these approaches to a benchmark
model developed using superlearner ensemble modeling techniques. Development and external validation in
~3036 and ~3465 participants across 8 and 12 studies, respectively. Aim 3: We propose to evaluate the
impact of panel eGFR in patients with heart and liver failure (N=1796) on clinical decisions and outcomes.
The expected outcome is development of panel eGFR that can be used as a confirmatory test and ultimately
incorporated into clinical practice guidelines. The proposal is highly innovative as it is comprehensive
spanning discovery, validation, assessment of clinical utility in populations not previously been studied and use
of novel statistical methods to compute individualized GFR estimates. The proposal is significant because it
will enable generalizable and accurate individualized GFR estimates in health and disease, particularly
diseases with unacceptably GFR estimation high error rates and diverse racial, ethnic and geographic groups.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：There is increasing recognition of the importance of patient-reported outcomes (PROs) for assessment of health-
related quality of life in both research and clinical settings. PROs are especially important for inherently subjective
but crucial clinical phenomena such as pain, mood, and fatigue. Despite much research in PROs, concerns
about reliability and validity persist, especially when used at the individual level, particularly among patients who
may struggle to understand PRO questions, such as those with low health literacy or undetected cognitive
impairment. Over the past decade, we have developed and tested a tool with the potential to enhance PROs at
the individual level – embodied conversational agents (ECA), which are computer characters that simulate face-
to-face conversation using voice, hand gestures, gaze cues and other nonverbal behavior. We have successfully
used them in behavioral interventions for populations with limited health literacy, elderly patients, and patients
with cancer. Face-to-face encounters, in conjunction with written instructions supported by pictures, remains one
of the best methods for communicating information in general, but is particularly effective for individuals with
limited health literacy. We have also demonstrated that ECAs can be used as valid alternatives to standard
paper-based surveys for substance use screening, and that the display of empathy for patients and other
relational behavior by ECAs leads to increased engagement by patients over time. We will adapt our prior work
on ECAs to produce ECA-PRO, a framework for administering PROs over time using an ECA on patients’
smartphones in English and Spanish. The ECA-PRO system will include novel user interfaces to optimally
communicate the results to patients and clinicians using clear visualizations. To demonstrate the generalizability
of ECA-PRO, we will focus on two clinical scenarios: 1) longitudinal monitoring of symptoms and quality of life in
patients undergoing cancer treatment, and 2) monitoring of medication adherence in patients taking long-term
oral anti-cancer drugs. We hypothesize that the ECA-PRO system, designed for individual-patient-level
interactions and data collection, will improve the reliability, validity, and overall clinical relevance of PROs
collected during cancer treatment. We will develop and evaluate a PRO system that engages patients with
interactive communication and empathy, while delivering standard PROs in a way that minimizes missing data
and enables user-friendly visual sharing of results. The ECA-PRO system will create a strong foundation for
PRO-based clinical decision-making. If successful, these tools can be rapidly and broadly disseminated.

 Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) is associated with excellent cure rates. Despite early disease control, this success
comes at considerable cost, with treatment-induced morbidity (“late effects” [LE]) that manifests as early as a
year after therapy (e.g., 2nd cancers, cardiovascular [CVD] disease), compromised health-related quality of life
(HRQL), and early mortality. Over the past 20 years, while important HL clinical trials have been conducted,
there has been a lack of consensus about the preferred approach to treatment, considering both short- and
longer term outcomes. While clinical trials provide rich information about short term disease outcomes, they do
not follow efficacy beyond 5 years and rarely track post-therapy morbidity. In contrast, HL registries capture
longitudinal outcomes and can be linked to other sources including healthcare utilization via administrative
claims and cancer registries to characterize LE and survival. This proposal represents an unprecedented
opportunity to draw on the collective expertise of International clinical HL oncology experts, epidemiologists,
imaging experts, and methods & modeling experts with access to individual patient data from modern HL clinical
trials and real-world registries from across the world. In preparation for the project, we harmonized individual
patient data (IPD) for >12,000 HL patients from 12 clinical trials and 4 large HL registries. Building on data
science principles, we established a common data model & unifying data dictionary, which allows us to expand
the current database over time, incorporating future data as they become available. We will harness these multi-
source data to first, create a modern prediction model via predictive modeling of pre-treatment clinical factors;
second, we will estimate and validate disease progression and early emergent late effects, enhanced by the
addition of interim PET imaging data and alternative treatment options via multi-state Cox proportional hazards
models to estimate transition probabilities; and third, we will generate a dynamic decision model to project
precalculated outcomes of interest, such as short term and longer term outcomes, including HRQL, The
aggregated, “standardized” precalculated visualizations/projections (life expectance and quality-adjusted life
years) will provide a basis for comparing alternative treatments for a broad range of disease subgroups and
patient characteristics “on the fly.” Furthermore, both the results of the statistical models & parameter estimates
from the simulation model will be validated and re-calibrated as needed in large external cohorts (i.e., German
Hodgkin Study Group (GHSG) clinical trials data and Dutch HL registry). The simulation model will then be
converted to open source, which will allow local analyses that go beyond our precalculated standard scenarios.
Our three-step approach (predictive modeling to multi-state modeling to simulation/decision modeling) will be
designed to incorporate future prospective data as new/novel treatments, and knowledge emerges over time.
Overall, this project’s results will be significant as they are expected to delineate precise outcomes & optimal
therapy for individual HL patients and inform the development of models and paradigms for other diseases.

Baseline reduced kidney function is highly prevalent among patients with acute heart failure (AHF) and is one
of the most powerful risk factors for adverse clinical outcomes. The association between acute kidney function
declines and outcomes, however, remain controversial, with some studies showing acute declines in estimated
glomerular filtration (eGFR) to be associated with worse outcomes but other studies not. The goal of Dr.
McCallum’s proposal is to better understand the mechanisms of acute eGFR declines that occur in the setting
of AHF and examine how acute eGFR declines are related to outcomes including long term kidney function,
mortality and AHF hospitalizations. The overall hypothesis is that three key components—congestion,
cardiac hemodynamics, and neurohormonal (NH) activity—are the primary risk factors for acute eGFR
declines, and that the relation between acute eGFR declines and clinical outcomes needs to be interpreted
within the context of changes in these three factors. In order to examine these relations, her Aims would
include 1) retrospective analysis of patients admitted to Tufts Medical Center for AHF and requiring a
pulmonary artery (PA) catheter (n=890) for repeated measures of congestion and cardiac hemodynamics; 2)
prospective enrollment of 140 patients admitted to Tufts Medical Center for AHF with an indwelling PA catheter
to assay for repeated measures of plasma NH activity; and 3) adoption of multi-trajectory modeling to develop
clinical phenotypes of acute cardiorenal syndrome (CRS) by incorporating trajectories of eGFR change,
congestion, cardiac hemodynamics, and NH activity. The career development plan incorporates didactic
training in longitudinal data analysis including joint modeling and multi-trajectory modeling, biomarker
methodology, introductory informatics for electronic health record research, as well as immersion and practical
training in cardiac hemodynamics and prospective patient recruitment, all under the mentorship of an
experienced group of nephrologists, cardiologists and statisticians with expertise in various aspects of the
CRS. Successful completion of these aims is feasible, as shown by Dr. McCallum’s preliminary data under her
institutional KL2 funding, as well her track record of productivity under her primary mentor Dr. Mark Sarnak.
Her co-mentor will be Dr. Jeffrey Testani, a cardiologist and Director of Heart Failure Research at Yale
University who has expertise in the CRS, has collaborated with Dr. McCallum on several manuscripts, and has
incorporated her into his research group and sponsored several trips for her to his research lab at Yale. With
this K23 award, Dr. McCallum will receive extensive training in biostatistical methods, dataset creation, CRS
pathophysiology, biomarker methodology, primary data collection and prospective study design. In aggregate,
completion of these aims will provide Dr. McCallum with expertise in the CRS and arm her with the tools
necessary to successfully compete for independent funding.

Although Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS) is an urgent public health priority, the diagnosis and
management of NAS remains challenging. This is primarily due to the multifactorial nature of NAS and the
highly subjective measures to assess this condition. Males and females with NAS have distinct risk profiles, yet
within the current paradigm they are managed uniformly. The limited understanding of long-term outcomes
further compounds the problem and predisposes this population to a myriad of health issues. To address these
knowledge gaps, the current proposal expands upon the molecular and behavioral data from our K12-funded
pilot study to better understand the impact of prenatal opioid exposure. An early sign of withdrawal in opioid-
exposed neonates is difficulty feeding followed by hyperphagia, which often precedes severe NAS and the
need for pharmacotherapy. Using saliva collected immediately after birth, we showed higher expression of a
key reward gene (DRD2) in opioid-exposed males compared to females. The expression of DRD2 also
correlated with the caloric intake in opioid-exposed males who later developed severe NAS and required
pharmacotherapy. These transcriptomic-behavioral data indicate that prenatal opioid exposure dysregulates
brain reward signaling in a sex-specific manner, resulting in hyperphagia as a reward-seeking behavior that
offsets the acute loss of opioids. Furthermore, opioid-exposed neonates have heightened expression of
inflammatory genes (IL6, MCP1) that correlate with the expression of DRD2, particularly in females. Expanding
on these preliminary results, the current proposal will examine if prenatal opioids dysregulate brain reward
signaling and modulate pro-inflammatory pathways with increased sex-specific risks for hyperphagia and
associated long-term cardiometabolic disorders. Our overarching goal is to understand changes in sex-specific
reward and inflammatory gene expression in opioid-exposed neonates throughout the first year of life. The
hypothesis will be tested in two aims: 1) Identify sex-specific effects of prenatal opioids on reward signaling
and inflammation, 2) Evaluate effects of prenatal opioids on risk for subsequent cardiometabolic disorders. We
will collect serial saliva samples from 56 opioid-exposed and 56 sex- and age-matched non-exposed neonates
during the initial hospitalization and then in a subset of infants post hospital discharge up to 1 year of age to
evaluate the expression of reward and inflammation genes. Early cardiometabolic risk will be assessed using
serum lipid panels at 1 year of age, along with growth and nutritional data. Results will be analyzed by sex. The
impact of this proposed project lies in the potential to advance the field with a more comprehensive
understanding of the sex-specific impact of prenatal opioid exposure on the developing brain through non-
invasive molecular analyses, enabling personalized medicine and longitudinal health monitoring.

This is an application for a K23 award for Dr. Shanthini Kasturi, a rheumatologist at Tufts Medical Center. Dr.
Kasturi seeks to establish herself as an independent investigator of patient-centered behavioral interventions
for rheumatic diseases, with an initial focus on systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The goal of this proposal
is to develop (Aim 1) and pilot test (Aim 2) a theory-driven peer coaching intervention to reduce fatigue, a
critical unmet need of patients with SLE. These research objectives are paired with training objectives to build
expertise in behavioral intervention development and skills in clinical trial design and conduct. In Aim 1, Dr.
Kasturi will design an intervention that targets the multidimensional components of fatigue through
individualized coaching administered by trained peers with SLE. Coaches will leverage validated patient-
reported outcome measures to tailor behavior change support to patients’ specific drivers of fatigue. The
intervention will be deployed via a mobile health application and be iteratively refined with the input of SLE
patients using user-centered design methodologies. In Aim 2, Dr. Kasturi will conduct a randomized controlled
pilot trial to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention in patients with SLE. To achieve these
goals, Dr. Kasturi has assembled an expert mentorship team and formulated the following training objectives:
(1) to build expertise in behavioral intervention development, including health behavior theory and research
methods, patient-engaged intervention development methods, and the use of mobile health interventions for
behavior change; and (2) to develop skills in clinical trial design and conduct, including advanced
methodologies for randomized behavioral trials and the conduct of multi-site trials. This project aligns with the
priorities outlined in the NIH Action Plan for Lupus Research through its focus on fatigue, its goal of developing
a behavioral intervention, and its integration of validated patient-reported outcome measures and mobile health
technology to enhance the intervention. This proposal will form the basis for a future R01 to test the efficacy of
the peer coaching intervention on fatigue in SLE, while supporting Dr. Kasturi’s development as a research
scientist with expertise in behavioral interventions for rheumatic diseases.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Project Summary
Covert cerebrovascular disease (CCD), comprising covert brain infarction (CBI) and white matter disease
(WMD), is commonly found incidentally on neuroimaging scans obtained in routine clinical care. CBI is
believed to be pathophysiologically similar to clinically-evident stroke, but with infarct locations in clinically less
articulate parts of the brain. Epidemiologic studies based on MRI-screened cohorts indicate that CBI is far
more common than clinically-evident stroke, and WMD is even more common. Both types of CCD are strong,
independent risk factors for future stroke and dementia. The American Heart Association/American Stroke
Association has identified CCD as a major priority for new studies on stroke prevention. Identifying high-risk
individuals prior to the onset of severe cognitive decline is a central goal in dementia prevention research.
However, application of insights from studies of MRI-screened cohorts to patients with incidentally-discovered
CCD is not straightforward. Patients are not screened but are selected for clinically-indicated neuroimaging;
real-world imaging is dominated by CT scans; neuroimaging interpretation and reporting are heterogeneous
and poorly standardized. Additionally, there are no ICD-9 codes for CBI or WMD, which also do not generally
appear in a patient’s problem list or in structured fields of electronic health records. Indeed, both patients and
their providers are often unaware of these findings even after they are detected. Our team has performed the
first large-scale study of the prevalence and prognostic importance of incidentally-discovered (id)-CCD using
natural language processing (NLP) algorithms and created a real-world cohort comprising approximately
250,000 stroke- and dementia-free patients over age 50 who received either head CT or MRI, approximately
30% of whom have id-CCD. These NLP-identified id-CBI and id-WMD are both strong predictors of future
clinically-evident stroke and dementia. While this cohort has yielded important insights, there are substantial
limitations. Extractable information on WMD severity is frequently missing. Even when present in text reports,
only relatively crude information on WMD burden can be obtained. Further, other evidence of CCD—including
microbleeds, microinfarcts, prominent perivascular spaces—may also be prognostically important. Finally,
direct image analysis may discover new radiomic biomarkers predictive of future stroke and dementia that are
not captured or unknown. The ambitious goal of this project is to develop a clinically useful algorithm that can
directly read routinely obtained neuroimaging scans at scale and relate findings to stroke and dementia
outcomes through the following specific aims: Aim 1: Develop a deep learning model to identify and
characterize covert id-CCD from routinely obtained CT and MRI neuroimages and use these features, and
other deep radiomic biomarkers, to predict the development of future stroke and dementia. Aim 2: Test the
deep learning algorithms developed in Aim 1 on a large cohort of patients from an integrated health system for
the prediction of future stroke and dementia to evaluate their incremental prognostic value.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：The treatment of cancer has been revolutionized by the development of targeted and immune-based therapies.
However, many of these new therapies, as well as established ones such as doxorubicin, can damage the heart
and cause severe heart failure. A growing body of evidence suggests that perturbations in cardiomyocyte
autophagy may play a central role in chemotherapy-induced heart failure, and the ability to image this process
in vivo could provide important insights. We have recently developed an autophagy-detecting nanoparticle (ADN)
and have used this agent to image autophagy in the heart during chemotherapy with doxorubicin and dasatanib.
The core of the agent consists of ferumoxytol, an MRI-detectable nanoparticle, to which several polyarginine-
Cy5.5 moieties are attached. The polyarginine peptides facilitate the translocation of the agent into the cell,
where it is taken up by autophagosomes and trafficked to the lysosomes. Folding of the polyarginine peptides
also results in stacking and quenching of the Cy5.5 fluorochromes until the peptides are cleaved by cathepsins
in the autophagolysosomes. We have shown using chemical inhibitors/stimulators of autophagy, and cells with
genetic deletion of the key autophagy proteins ATG5 and ATG7, that the activation of ADN is specific for
autophagy. Likewise, using a transgenic mouse with overexpression of the DDiT4L transcription factor in the
heart and the canonical autophagy model of intermittent fasting, we have shown that ADN can detect autophagy
in vivo with a high degree of sensitivity and specificity. In this proposal we will use ADN to interrogate changes
in autophagy in both the heart and cancer. While the upregulation of autophagy in the heart is protective, it has
the potential to either protect or harm tumors undergoing chemotherapy. We hypothesize that the imaging of
autophagy with ADN will allow conditions and strategies to be identified where the upregulation of autophagy is
cardioprotective but does not attenuate the effect of the chemotherapy on the tumor. In aim 1 of the proposal,
we will make a small chemical modification to the probe, enabling it to be detected before and after its activation,
and use confocal/super-resolution microscopy of live cells to develop a detailed kinetic model of autophagy.
IPSC-derived cardiomyocytes and relevant tumor cell lines will be studied. In aim 2 we will assess the impact of
autophagy upregulation on a library of tumor cell lines exposed to a large panel of chemotherapies, many known
to cause heart failure. In aim 3 we will use a multispectral fluorescence approach to image autophagy, apoptosis
and inflammation in the heart and in tumors in mice in vivo. The impact of autophagy upregulation will be
assessed and a detailed kinetic model of autophagy in the heart and in tumors will be derived. Execution of the
proposed aims will provide important insights into the role of autophagy in the heart and cancer, and provide a
platform to identify safe and effective autophagy regulating strategies to protect the heart during chemotherapy.

The avascular cornea is innervated by a dense network of sensory processes derived from the ophthalmic and
maxillary regions of the trigeminal ganglion. Corneal nerves provide not only mechanical, chemical, and thermal
sensitivity to the front of the eye but also release nutrients and trophic factors that supply the cornea. Structural
and functional nerve abnormalities are the hallmarks of neurotrophic keratopathy, a degenerative disease
associated with impaired corneal healing and ulceration. These abnormatilies can also be observed in other
conditions known to cause corneal damage, such as dry eye. Most therapeutic approaches aimed to promote
corneal nerve regeneration focus on providing neurotrophic support. Recently, the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration has approved the use of recombinant nerve growth factor eye drops for the treatment of
neurotrophic keratopathy, but its use has been associated with several adverse effects and limitations.
 This proposal centers on a major gap in our understanding of the inhibitory mechanisms hampering corneal
nerve regeneration, which could prove important to develop new strategies to promote functional reinnervation.
Research during the last decade has consistently found increased levels of the carbohydrate-binding protein
galectin-3 in the tear fluid and corneal epithelium of patients with ocular surface disease. Importantly, the areas
where increased galectin-3 expression has been observed coincide with the location of intraepithelial nerve
terminals and the basal nerve plexus. It is become increasingly clear that multimerization of galectin-3 leads to
cross-linking of carbohydrate ligands and the formation of lattice-like structures on plasma membranes essential
for regulating cell survival or degeneration. We hypothesize that overabundance of galectin-3 promotes
degenerative signaling by interacting with specific surface receptors in peripheral sensory neurons and may
constitute an important therapeutic target for the full recovery of nerve sensation in corneal disease.
 The following specific aims will address this objective: (1) to examine the role of galectin-3 in modulating
neurotrophic signaling, (2) to determine the impact of galectin-3 on the neural mechanisms underlying corneal
disease, and (3) to investigate whether whether therapeutic inhibition of galectin-3 improves corneal nerve
regeneration and sensation. It is anticipated that the successful conclusion of this project will reveal a novel
mechanism by which galectin-3 regulates neurotrophic signaling in corneal nerves. Results could potentially
advance the field of corneal nerve regeneration by targeting the pathological actions of galectin-3 and lead to
the development of novel therapies to promote functional innervation.

Our objective is to develop tools that improve early diagnosis of systemic light-chain (AL) amyloidosis, a disease
that causes heart and kidney failure and early death, in patients with smoldering multiple myeloma, a disease in
which patients make immunoglobulin free light chains but are relatively asymptomatic. Based on a retrospective
study in members of the US Armed Forces who developed AL, there is a 10 to 15 year precursor period prior to
patients presenting at a median age of 63 with symptoms of AL due to toxic free light chains (FLC) and amyloid
deposits. In similar studies of patients with smoldering myeloma we know that 2% of them develop AL, meaning
that 2% have FLC that are markedly abnormal. Over half of new AL patients present with heart involvement and
it is the failure to diagnose early that underlies their 20% mortality within 6 months. In this application, we seek
support to screen patients with smoldering multiple myeloma for undiagnosed AL and risk of AL using a series
of criteria that will increase our knowledge of the likelihood of having undiagnosed AL or of being at risk for AL.
Only efforts to diagnose AL and determine risk of AL in the precursor phase of the disease will reduce the early
mortality rate. Our goal is to develop a likelihood algorithm for undiagnosed AL and risk of AL in smoldering
myeloma patients and our aims in this application are to create a network to enroll 340 patients with smoldering
multiple myeloma (SMM) on a collaborative study requiring marrow and blood specimens and collection of data
for a training set of likelihood statistics and to plan the future validation study and to validate an next generation
sequence (NGS) assay that identifies IGVL genes in clonal plasma cells. The clonal κ and λ IGVL genes in AL
cases are restricted AL-related sets of genes. The likelihood algorithm will employ 5 parameters: (1) the presence
of SMM; (2) a difference between involved (pathologic) and uninvolved FLC > 23mg/L; (3) clonal plasma cell
cytogenetics showing t(11;14) or gain 1q, (4) AL-related κ or λ IGVL genes by NGS, and (5) NT-proBNP >
332pg/mL. All subjects will have their clonal IGVL genes identified by NGS enabling the creation and validation
of a laboratory developed test in a precision medicine laboratory that is certified under regulations of the Clinical
Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA). Our long-term goal is to overcome the current inability in
patients with SMM to effectively assess for the presence of occult AL or to estimate the likelihood of developing
AL. By determining the values of the 5 parameters we will create the training set for an algorithm to estimate the
likelihood of having or progressing to AL and will be able to design the validation study. We have assembled a
collaborative team of investigators at centers across the USA to pursue our aims and an expert support group
to address the opportunities, challenges and patient care issues that will arise. We have put together a team of
expert collaborators from over a dozen academic centers and expert consultants in myeloma, AL amyloidosis,
molecular biology and protein biology, in order to pursue these aims, realizing the complexity of the endeavor
and the demands of each aim.

TETmedical Inc. is developing a tethered enzyme technology (TET) for rapid point-of-care (PoC) and/or at-home
testing of liver enzyme levels, enabling convenient and timely tracking of drug-induced liver injury (DILI) and
other sources of liver damage. When the liver is damaged or diseased, the enzymes aspartate aminotransferase
(AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) are released into the blood, making these the most frequently used
markers of hepatocellular injury. Because the liver is the primary site of drug metabolism, patients’ AST and ALT
levels are often evaluated to monitor DILI as a key component of clinical trials to determine drug safety. Currently,
to have the test performed, patients must travel to a clinic to have a blood sample drawn, which is then tested in
an in-house laboratory or mailed off to a central laboratory testing facility. Visits to the clinic place a burden on
the elderly and/or those with limited mobility, and add a geographic constraint to clinical trial participants,
reducing the diversity of subjects. The testing process is slow, burdensome, and costly, and severely limits the
frequency of testing and the speed with which a problem can be detected. In response to this need, TETmedical
is advancing a simple, rapid, and affordable test for AST/ALT measurement that can be performed at the PoC
or in the patient’s own home based on a biomimetic approach to oriented immobilization of enzymes on
nanoparticles (NPs). This method significantly improves the efficiency of coupled enzymatic reactions and is
based on the TET platform that enables ultra-rapid, highly sensitive, and quantitative detection of analytes. Of
note, TETmedical has enabled luminescence readouts of AST/ALT in the highly reducing environment of human
serum/plasma, thus overcoming a challenge that prevented luminescent quantification of AST/ALT.
TETmedical’s AST/ALT test will include disposable cartridges with the TET biosensor embedded on a paper-
based blood separator and, due to a recent partnership, a lancet based blood sample collection device to enable
repeated at-home testing of liver enzymes. Once the sample is added to the cartridge, it will then be inserted
into an electronic reader that will measure the luminescence-based readout and provide a quantitative result.
For this Phase I project, TETmedical’s Specific Aims are: 1) Optimize the tethered enzyme assays for detection
of AST and ALT including the speed, range of detection, and calibration of luminescence outputs, 2) Improve
separation of blood components and design of cartridges, and 3) Validate technology using spiked human blood
samples. Completion of these Aims will result in a cartridge integrating blood separation and TET biosensors to
quantify AST and ALT, and controls for hemolysis, which are already under development. This will provide the
necessary proof of concept for a future Phase II application, which will include a validation study in clinical
samples, integration with the at-home blood collection device, and further development of the prototype
electronic reader device, enabling simple PoC or at-home use.

 There is an enormous need for qualified people to pursue careers in STEM (Noonan,
2017). However, the lack of a strong foundation in mathematics means students are less likely
to pursue STEM majors and careers (Chen, 2013; Griffith, 2010; Huang, Taddese, & Walter, E,
2000; Kokkelenberg & Sinha, 2010; Lowell et. al., 2009; Seo, Shen & Alfaro, 2019). Students
from low-income families, women, and underrepresented minorities are also less likely to major
in STEM (Bettinger, 2010; Griffith, 2010; Hill, Corbett & Rose, 2010; Kokkelenberg & Sinha,
2010). Improving math learning in the elementary grades is important to ensure children have
the essential foundational skills and strong self-efficacy beliefs to be able to succeed with later
mathematics and pursue careers in STEM. With this Fast-Track grant, we propose to build a
mathematical problem-solving environment, Teachley Problem Solving (TPS), to transform the
way elementary students learn to solve math problems. TPS will include a set of digital tools to
help students understand and classify the underlying structure of problems, use clear visuals to
model the mathematics of the problems, and construct strong mathematical arguments. The
environment will also integrate into ASSISTments, a math curriculum platform built by The
ASSISTments Foundation and Wooster Polytechnic Institute .
 Outcomes. The proposal will encourage two main outcomes, namely: 1) improved
student math achievement and 2) increased math self-efficacy. A key research aim is to
determine whether supporting elementary students with digital problem-solving tools helps them
develop stronger problem-solving skills as compared to typical instruction. We also anticipate
that using the engaging tools with real-time feedback will also bolster students’ motivation and
self-efficacy in mathematics.
 Improving students’ academic outcomes and math self-efficacy during elementary school
will promote later success in high school mathematics. Since the number of advanced math
classes students take is correlated with likelihood to complete a STEM degree, (Chen, 2013) a
distal outcome of this proposal is increasing the number of students pursuing careers in STEM.

A diverse scientific workforce is essential to fostering scientific innovation and excellence and
providing safe and quality learning and work environments. Despite extensive efforts and some
noteworthy progress, certain groups' underrepresentation remains a concern for the health-
related scientific workforce. Undergraduate research experiences, such as summer research
programs, have been shown to increase learning skills, career ambitions, completion of a STEM
degree, and advancement to a graduate program for undergraduate students, particularly those
from underrepresented groups in science. In response to
PAR-21-168
"Summer Research
Education Experience Program (R25)", we propose the Syracuse University-Summer Training in
Alcohol Research (SU-STAR) program. The SU-STAR program aims to (1) recruit an annual
cohort of
five to seven undergraduate students from underrepresented groups
in science across
the nation who demonstrate academic potential as well as strong interests in alcohol and health
research and in advancing to a graduate school in related disciplines; (2) provide participants
with the opportunity to participate in a rigorous eight-week research internship and enrichment
activities, (3) conduct
ongoing evaluations during the summer program and bi-annual follow-ups
regarding the program's success in participant recruitment, retention, and educational and
career outcomes; and (4) disseminate program information and materials to the undergraduate
student body, academic units, and scientific community. Ultimately, this program will expand a
pipeline of diverse individuals in health research, which will enhance the science workforce's
inclusion and strengthen alcohol science by incorporating diverse perspectives and life
experiences.

Developed, together with Drs. Jenny Libien, MD, Ph.D., and Juan Marcos Alarcon, Ph.D., the Research Experience in Autism for College and High School students (REACH) summer program, provides underrepresented college students an advantage in pursuing a career in the biomedical fields. The REACH course is a research centric program with supplementary modules aimed at enhancing the participants’ knowledge of neurological disorders with emphasis in Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) through comprehensive lectures and clinical experiences. Students also receive instruction in career development with emphasis in mental health disparities and cultural competence. These experiences will inform the student-generated hypotheses and project that the students will develop throughout the summer. The program recruits basic science investigators, physicians, clinicians and graduate (PhD and medical students) students as REACH mentors. Utilizing team-based and peer-mentoring strategies, the student participants with the aid of their dedicated faculty and graduate student mentors will develop research hypotheses regarding ASD that they will experimentally resolve by the conclusion of the 8-week program. By exposing the participants to a diverse population of mentors, we hope to impress upon them the path and attainability of a life in the neuroscience and biomedical fields. Our program’s long-term goal is twofold, first to increase access and retention of underrepresented minorities into the neuroscience/biomedical field. Second, to positively impact underrepresented communities through our students.

Social connections are critical to human well-being, and people lacking in these connections (social isolation)
or who perceive that they are lacking these connections (loneliness) have lower self-management of chronic
disease, are more likely to suffer from substance abuse disorders and depression, and are at higher risk for
premature mortality. People living with HIV report a significant burden of loneliness and other indicators of
impaired social connectedness; these impaired social connections have been linked to reduced HIV adherence
and quality of life. The significant strain imposed on social relationships by COVID-19 restrictions and by
losses of family, friends, and community has brought urgency to the issue of social connections, particularly for
vulnerable populations such as those living with HIV infection. COVID-19 has also brought increased calls for
implementation of interventions focused on social connections, which in turn has highlighted a critical lack of
effective interventions in this area, rooted in evidence gaps regarding relationships between social connection
and health outcomes in diverse populations, in understanding of the unique and synergistic influences of
conceptually distinct dimensions of social connection on health over time, and on modifiable pathways linking
these connections to health outcomes. Applying a longitudinal, mixed-methods, and community-engaged
framework within a nationally-representative and well-characterized HIV cohort study, the MACS/WIHS
Combined Cohort Study (MWCCS), this project aims to: (Aim 1) characterize longitudinal and multidimensional
patterns of social connection both prior to and during the COVID-era, and identify social, behavioral and
genomic predictors of these patterns; (Aim 2) identify relationships between patterns of social connection and
HIV outcomes, including identification of mechanistic pathways via substance use disorders and depression,
and (Aim 3) assess multilevel mediators and moderators of relationships between social connection and
temporally associated outcomes including area-level socio-geographic indicators of poverty and population
density. This work utilizes the extensive platform of the MWCCS, including annual laboratory evaluation of HIV
disease indices, validated medication adherence measures, genome-wide data that will be utilized to construct
polygenic risk scores, annually updated geocoded data, and diagnostic assessments of substance use
disorders and depression (N=2000). To this, we will add an annual battery of social connection measures,
including social and emotional loneliness, social isolation, and social integration at selected MWCCS sites
(N=735), coupled with nested, longitudinal qualitative interviews (N=40). This multidimensional, longitudinal
and multilevel analysis will significantly extend previous research in this area, and findings from this project can
be utilized to identify actionable targets to support the design of effective interventions in this important area
and high priority population.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Project summary
Large datasets generated by hospitals could have a transformative effect on medical knowledge and patient
care. Yet currently the volume of data is more likely to overwhelm clinicians and the challenges of the data can
overwhelm machine learning algorithms. Intensive care units (ICUs) generate data at a resolution of seconds,
for the entirety of a patient's stay. Our long-term goal is to turn these data into actionable knowledge, like risk
factors for a disease, early intervention targets, and real-time information to support clinical decisions. This is
a broad problem, but particularly important in ICUs, which involve high stakes decisions being made in a
complex environment under time pressure. We focus in particular on understanding consciousness in adults,
and neurologic status in neonates. While 7% of ICU admissions are due to loss of consciousness, and degree of
consciousness is critical to evaluating prognosis, making difficult choices such as when to withdraw care, and
providing early interventions to improve quality of life, there are no objective or automated assessments for
consciousness (adults) or neurologic status (neonates). We have shown that unresponsive patients with brain
activation were twice as likely to regain the ability to follow commands compared to unresponsive patients
without such activation, yet these assessments are too time consuming for regular clinical use. However we also
showed that physiological data routinely collected in ICUs can be used as a proxy to classify consciousness. It is
still not known why it changes and we must be sure that the patterns we find are in fact causal to avoid treating
symptoms instead of a disease or launching unsuccessful clinical trials. There have been two key barriers
preventing a causal understanding of consciousness. First, variables measured for each ICU patient differ, and
can differ within a patient over the course of their admission. This leads to confounding when attempting to
infer causal models, and has prevented learning a single model for all patients, which limits generalizability.
Second, while the challenges of medical data require new methods, researchers are rarely able to rigorously
evaluate and compare them, since real-world data lacks ground truth and often cannot be shared for privacy
reasons. To address these challenges, we aim 1) to develop methods that learn generalizable causal models with
latent variables (by intelligently sharing and combining information across patients), 2) to develop data driven
simulations methods for testing machine learning algorithms while preserving privacy, and 3) to apply these
methods to neonatal and neurological ICU data. We aim to create better indicators for consciousness and to
uncover causes of both neurological status in ICU and its link to long-term functional outcomes. Our work
turns potential weaknesses of medical data (different variables measured across individuals) into a strength,
and will enable better use of large-scale observational biomedical data for real-time treatment decisions.

Large-scale genetic studies of major depression (MD) are primarily comprised of European descent cohorts.
Broadening diversity of study populations will empower genomic research by expanding discovery and
enhancing our understanding of the role of human genomic variation in disease etiology. This proposal
supports the formation of the Cross-Population Working Group on Genes and Environment in Major
Depression (POP-GEM) with the goal of characterizing genomic variants associated with MD across
ancestries. The overarching goal of this proposal is to leverage large-scale global collaborations to assemble
extant and emerging datasets from diverse ancestries in order to perform the largest and most inclusive cross-
population GWAS of MD to date (>70,000 diverse ancestry cases Phase I and >200,000 diverse ancestry
cases Phase II). We will delineate the genetic architecture of MD across populations, facilitating fine-mapping
of causal variants, improved polygenic risk profiling for all, examination of sex differences, and assessing
direction of causation between major comorbid traits and disorders. This application presents an exceptional
opportunity to gain insight into the etiology of MD and comorbid disease in groups underrepresented in prior
genetics research. Our broad goal is to address the major limitations in our knowledge of the genetic and
environmental risk architecture of MD in persons of diverse ancestries and lead to improvement in etiologic
understanding, diagnosis, prevention, and treatment in all populations.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Surfactant insufficiency compromises pulmonary compliance and respiratory function in multiple pulmonary
pathologies. Our understanding of surfactant metabolism in adult pulmonary disease is very limited and this
restricts the potential for therapeutic targeting. In this project, we have generated a new genetic model of
surfactant insufficiency in adult disease by deleting the low-density lipoprotein receptor related protein 1 (LRP1)
specifically in surfactant producing type 2 cells (AEC2). LRP1 functions as lipoprotein receptor and extracellular
protease clearing receptor and it is associated with decreased respiratory function in patients with COPD and
pulmonary arterial hypertension. Studies in our generated cell line of LRP1 knockdown AEC2 (LRP1 KD) and
tamoxifen-inducible AEC2-specific LRP1 knockout mice (SPC-LRP1-/-) show that LRP1 is required to maintain
surfactant lipid secretion and intracellular lipid homeostasis to ensure optimal pulmonary compliance and
respiratory function. We hypothesize that LRP1 controls surfactant metabolism in AEC2 and we will study the
regulatory mechanisms. In Aim 1 we will decipher the mechanism of action of LRP1 at the membrane level in
AEC2 and its regulation of the lipid source for surfactant synthesis in AEC2. In Aim 2 we will investigate the
epithelial to mesenchymal cross talk and the role of LRP1 in the progressive decline in lung function during
profibrotic challenges and molecular mechanisms responsible. We will attempt a new therapeutic approach to
stop the decline.
 This proposal is innovative conceptually and technically. The role of AEC2 lipid metabolism during adult
pulmonary disease is unknown. LRP1 regulates many cellular functions through lipid metabolism in different
tissues and our study shows that it also regulates pulmonary function through surfactant lipid metabolism. In
addition, we use novel techniques that include inducible and cell-specific genetic knockout models in vivo lipid
tracing and -omics analysis. Surfactant homeostasis enables basic pulmonary function, but the regulation of
surfactant homeostasis in adult disease is very little understood. The significance of this research is further
underscored by the fact that surfactant lipid is altered in multiple pulmonary pathologies, including the most
prevalent ones.

The ability of experimentalists to investigate biological systems has often been limited to pre-programmed
open-loop protocols whereby systems are probed based on assumptions and predetermined models. In
contrast, real-time feedback control allows systems to be dynamically probed with parameter perturbations
calculated as functions of instantaneous closed-loop system measurements, enabling researchers to
address questions not amenable to open-loop approaches. While there are many biological problems that
can be made more tractable by such feedback control – such as dynamic probing of ion-channel function in
neurons or manipulation of sleep network dynamics using auditory and electrical stimuli governed by real-
time EEG feedback – technical complexities often hinder its adoption.
Because there has been a many-decades advance in computing technologies, it is counter-intuitive that
real-time experiment control is not possible with standard computer operating systems (without expensive
add-on components). They are simply not designed for such strictly timed tasks. Furthermore, commercial
real-time systems are costly and require end-user customization for the lab, such that they are typically not
portable to the broader scientific community. To circumvent these limitations, we developed a fast and
highly versatile real-time biological experimentation system – the Real-Time eXperiment Interface (RTXI).
RTXI is free and open source, compatible with an extensive range of experimentation hardware, and
delivers reproducible, hard real-time performance via a user-tailorable interface on standard laboratory
computers. Importantly, RTXI offers extensive versatility and high-performance to “power users,” while
simultaneously providing a rich – and ever growing – library of experiment-control modules that require little
effort for those who are not computationally savvy.
RTXI has grown to the point where it is now an invaluable part of the scientific programs of many leading
research groups. In addition to updating and maintaining RTXI for those, and future, users, there remain
important avenues for development that would substantially expand RTXI’s functionality, reproducibility
enhancement, and utility for an even broader group of biological researchers. Thus, we propose:
1. To keep RTXI pushing scientific innovation by overhauling its base code and core modules.
2. To enable several new real-time experiment paradigms.
3. To ease and enrich experimentalists’ user experience and reproducibility.
Critically, the work proposed here will ensure that RTXI remains a valuable research tool for its varied
group of outstanding biological scientist end users. Furthermore, we will expand RTXI’s utility significantly
by building and supporting additional classes of experiments and the groundbreaking science they will
enable.

Research (PRIDE-CVD) formerly known as SIPID (Summer Institute Program to Increase Diversity) at the
State University of New York Downstate Health Sciences University (Downstate) in Brooklyn, New York. The
goal of the SIPID/PRIDE-CVD is to nurture and instruct underrepresented scientists/clinicians in
multidisciplinary approaches to research in cardiovascular health disparities using Brooklyn as a living
laboratory. The SIPID/PRIDE-CVD has been in existence for 17 years and has trained 129 mentees from 103
Universities nationwide. As a result of this training, 68.4% and 78% of the SIPID/PRIDE-CVD mentees,
secured peer-reviewed grants, 74% and 46% were promoted and their publications increased by 13-fold and
4.6-fold since graduation, respectively. To continue to build on this success and years of experience, this
renewal has the following Specific Aims:
1: Select and train qualified underrepresented scientists/clinicians with potential to contribute to the
knowledge in cardiovascular health disparities research
2: Provide long-term tailored one-to-one and peer mentoring with the goal to submit a research grant
application
3: Provide intensive individualized training and guidance in grant writing and peer review to enhance
the capacity for success in research careers
4: Provide financial support for small research projects to facilitate transition to independence
5: Evaluate long-term effectiveness of PRIDE-CVD
The renewal of PRIDE-CVD at Downstate is characterized by: 1) Its partnership with minority-led community-
based organizations with expertise in health disparities; 2) The living laboratory of Brooklyn, New York, an
urban setting in which to conduct health disparities and CVD research; 3) A well renown faculty roster with a
high number of minority members; 4) A historical context providing 17 years of experience in training,
mentoring and supporting underrepresented junior faculty. It is expected that the PRIDE-CVD will continue to
contribute significantly to improving the pool of highly-capable underrepresented professionals in
cardiovascular health research and creating a sense of community among mentees, an important aspect as
they continue to grow in their career paths. The ultimate goal in increasing diversity among the ranks of
underrepresented scientists/clinicians is an important step towards alleviating health disparities in CVD.

Biomolecular condensates are dynamic, membraneless compartments that spatiotemporally regulate a
myriad of cellular functions from gene transcription to cellular stress response. Liquid-liquid phase
separation (LLPS) is increasingly appreciated as the biophysical mechanism for how these condensates
assemble. Key to proper condensate function is the maintenance of their dynamics and
assembly/disassembly processes, but little is known about these mechanisms. Hints are provided from
disease states whereby condensates may undergo liquid-to-solid transitions into cytoplasmic inclusions
that contain protein quality control components and are characteristic of proteinopathies such as
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. We have identified UBQLN2, a member of ubiquitin-mediated protein
quality control systems, as a contributor to condensate function. We recently showed that UBQLN2 forms
condensates in vitro, and is recruited to stress granules, cytoplasmic condensates that form in response
to stress. The multitude of UBQLN2 functions are driven through interactions with proteasomal subunits,
polyubiquitin chains, and client proteins. Ubiquitin and polyubiquitin, biological signals for the
maintenance of protein homeostasis through degradation and autophagy, drive disassembly of UBQLN2
condensates in vitro. These observations have broad implications for how phase separation mechanisms
regulate the function of protein quality control systems. In this project, we aim to identify the molecular
and cellular mechanisms that drive how UBQLN2 condensates assemble and disassemble. Aim 1
determines how domain-domain interactions promote or inhibit phase separation of UBQLN2 via
construction of phase diagrams for constructs from a combination of UBQLN2 domain deletion and
disease-linked mutations. These domain deletions will be used to mimic the different “states” of UBQLN2
when specific domains are engaged with binding partners and unable to contribute to LLPS. We will use
UBQLN2 disease-linked mutations as a nature-provided library to elucidate how intra- and intermolecular
UBQLN2 interactions promote or inhibit condensate assembly and alter condensate morphology and
material properties both in vitro and in mammalian cell culture models. Aim 2 quantifies how UBQLN2
condensates are affected by UBQLN2 engagement with protein quality control components, including
proteasomal receptors, client proteins, and different types of polyubiquitin chains. We monitor these
effects in vitro and with designed mutants in vivo. Importantly, we develop a reconstituted UBQLN2
condensate model to quantify the parameters of how polyubiquitin and polyubiquitinated substrates
engage with UBQLN2 to disassemble condensates. These studies will lay the foundation for determining
the physiological roles of phase separation as it pertains to protein homeostasis through ubiquitin-
mediated pathways.

play an important role in cardiac left-right development. Evidence from model organisms, such as in zebrafish
organ of asymmetry, (Kupffer’s Vesicle, KV) indicates that conserved cilia-driven leftward flow establishes left-
right signals to regulate target genes to control asymmetric heart morphogenesis. While events downstream of
leftward flow have received much attention, little is known about how the organ of asymmetry is formed and the
biology of the ciliated cells that generate fluid flow. This project addresses the broad question: How do ciliated
cells develop into a functional polarized organ? To address this question we are bringing together cell biology
and developmental biology to investigate how the cytokinetic bridge establishes apical polarity and a lumen in
vivo. We propose that this occurs through a sequential process that starts with cell division and placement of
the cytokinetic midbody, which marks a site for where the apical membrane should be placed. Cytokinetic
bridge resolution (a.k.a. abscission) results in the separation of two daughter cells following mitosis allowing for
the cell to initiate ciliogenesis. This process has important implications in embryogenesis, and broad
implications in the role of cytokinesis in developing cellular diversity. While abscission has been examined in
vitro, little has been done to examine the role of cytokinesis/abscission in epithelial establishment and de novo
lumen formation in vivo. Thus, our work will test the overall hypothesis that cell division is an essential
process that initiates lumen formation, ciliogenesis, and subsequently tissue morphogenesis. Here we propose
to examine in the zebrafish KV a requirement for abscission in the transition of progenitor-mesenchymal-like
migratory cells to epithelial-ciliated cells (tested in Aim 1). For instance, does cell division trigger KV-specific
apical polarity protein expression and does division contribute to how cells are patterned to form a KV? We
propose that following cytokinesis, daughter cells stay interconnected by a cytokinetic bridge while apical
polarity is established. This process requires targeted membrane traffic into the cytokinetic bridge. During this
time, the two daughter cells position themselves so that the cytokinetic bridge is placed where an apical
membrane and lumen will form. Once the bridge is cleaved, a lumen is initiated (Aim 2) and KV cells can form
primary cilia (Aim 3). We will use photoconversion to track cell fate following division, and laser ablation or
optogenetics to determine whether abscission timing is important for apical polarity, cilia formation, and
lumenogenesis. These studies will identify important mechanisms for de novo tissue morphogenesis.

Protein detection and biomarker profiling have wide-ranging significance in many areas of disease prognostics,
diagnostics, and therapeutics. For example, the progression and development of various cancers are
accompanied by alterations in specific protein expressions. These variations in different biofluids are indicative
of disease-like conditions. A long-standing difficulty of existing methods is the detection of multiple proteins in a
complex biological sample with high sensitivity and a broad dynamic range. In addition, scalable protein
identification and quantification techniques are usually created with sacrificed sensitivity, so their applicability in
clinical settings remains limited. To overcome these fundamental and technical shortcomings, we will develop,
optimize, and validate a next-generation class of sensing elements for targeted protein biomarker detection at
single-recognition event precision. These proposed studies aim to engineer synthetic sensors made of a
single-polypeptide chain protein nanostructure. This protein nanostructure encompasses a membrane protein
pore and a programmable protein binder. The protein pore is a reporter that generates an output signature,
which depends on the identity and quantity of the biomarker. A programmable binder is a small antibody-
mimetic scaffold, such as a monobody or an affibody, sampling the targeted biomarker in solution. Hence, a
generic binder can be modified for multiple protein analytes. This way, such a modular design significantly
expands the utility of these sensing elements for numerous biomarkers while preserving their high sensitivity
and specificity using the resistive-pulse technique. This critical benefit is facilitated by the genetically encoded
nature of these sensors so that they can form combinatorial libraries of tethered binders. These manipulations
of modular pore-based detectors equipped with antibody-mimetic binders have not been conducted previously.
They are intended for use in challenging biofluids, where specific binder-biomarker interactions will be
unambiguously distinguished from nonspecific interactions of the medium constituents. Further advantages of
this real-time and label-free technology include maintaining an amplified signal-to-noise ratio in a wide dynamic
range due to the superior bandwidth of time-resolved electrical recordings. The expected immediate outcomes
of these proposed studies will be the following: (i) development, optimization, and validation of monobody- and
affibody-based sensors for protein detection; (ii) protein biomarker detection in multiplexed and high-
throughput formulations; (iii) protein biomarker detection in heterogeneous solutions. These results will
represent a platform for fingerprinting panels of multiple protein targets in biofluids without impairing the
sensitivity of these determinations. This proposed research will impact quantitative proteomics and biosensor
technology by providing a fundamental basis and tools for ultrasensitive biomarker detection.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Catheter associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) is one of the most common healthcare-associated
infections (HAIs), with a prevalence of 13 – 15% in the United States. CAUTIs are also blamed for
increased morbidity and mortality of affected patients with an estimated 13,000 deaths annually. It is
well known that the abiotic catheter materials are prone to colonization of microbes, which then ascend
the catheter via motility and biofilm formation, causing infections in the urinary tract. Due to the protection
of the biofilm matrix and slow growth of attached cells, biofilm cells are up to 1,000 times more resistant
to antimicrobials than the planktonic cells of the same species. Thus, CAUTIs are difficult to treat and
blockage of the catheter lumen can occur especially during long-term use, leading to stone formation
and infections of the bladder and even kidney. Treatment of CAUTIs with high doses of antimicrobial
agents can also adversely promote the development of multidrug resistant bacteria. Despite extensive
research to date, no current technology can provide long-term (>30 days) fouling control. This unmet
challenge motivated us to engineer smart catheters to ultimately eradicate CAUTI.
Recently, the PI’s lab developed a new antifouling strategy based on active topography that drives
magnetically responsive micron-size pillars to beat with a tunable frequency and force level. This was
achieved by loading Fe3O4 nanoparticles on the tip of each pillar and generating an electromagnetic
field using an insulated copper coil embedded in the catheter wall (thus does not change the catheter
profile). This novel design demonstrated unprecedented strong antifouling activities that can inhibit
biofilm formation of multiple species by up to 3.6 logs (99.98%) for 48 hours and remove mature biofilms
by up to 3.5 logs (99.97%) on demand with a stronger force, compared to the flat control. A prototype
catheter with micron-size pillars on the inner wall was engineered and remained clean for more than 30
days under the flow of artificial urine and the challenge of uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC), while
both flat and static controls were completely blocked by UPEC biofilms within 5 days. These results
motivated the team to further develop this technology to also control biofouling of the outer catheter wall,
which is covered by urethral mucosa and involved in two thirds of CAUTIs. Integrated simulation and
experimental studies will be conducted to understand the mechanism of biofouling control by active
topography and the design principles for antifouling topographies on both sides of the catheter wall. The
best design will be further tested in vivo using a rabbit model of CAUTI induced by UPEC. Both CAUTI
prevention (up to 30 days) and removal of established biofilms will be evaluated.

L-DOPA remains the gold-standard treatment for Parkinson’s disease (PD). Unfortunately, within a decade of
commencing L-DOPA, nearly 90% of PD patients develop intractable abnormal involuntary movements known as L-
DOPA-induced dyskinesias (LID), severely impacting quality of life. Research implicates serotonin (5-HT) neurons
as a source of LID as they can take up L-DOPA, convert it to dopamine (DA), and release DA as an unregulated
“false neurotransmitter” leading to a dyskinesogenic phenotype. Although treatments aimed at alleviating LID have
emerged, only a minority of patients benefit due to their cost, side effects and/or invasiveness. Moreover, we
have yet to find a way to prevent LID development, in part due to major gaps in knowledge on how L-DOPA
treatment instigates maladaptive 5-HT reorganization and aberrant striatal output. Our research team has
recently collected preliminary data using novel approaches that provide exciting new insights into the
mechanisms of 5-HT neuroplasticity that will enlighten both basic and clinical science. These convergent findings
led us to postulate our Central Hypothesis that maladaptive 5-HT-raphe-striatal neurocircuit plasticity
precipitates and maintains LID. The overarching goal for our multi-investigator team is to identify the mechanisms
underlying the development of structural and functional maladaptation within the raphe-striatal circuit driving LID,
which in turn could lead to novel, optimized targets for intervention. We will fill this knowledge gap through the
pursuit of 3 independent, but inter-related Specific Aims. Our 3 Specific Aims will: 1) define the extent to which
DA denervation and/or L-DOPA treatment results in anatomical and functional reorganization of the 5-HT raphe-
striatal pathway in PD and experimental parkinsonism, 2) use projection-specific chemogenetic modulations to
determine the impact of the 5-HT raphe-striatal activity on L-DOPA-induced anti-parkinsonian efficacy and
dyskinesia, and 3) establish how regulating DA release from 5-HT raphe-striatal neurons prevents the
development of LID and associated maladaptive neuronal changes. The proposed cross-species investigation will
establish neuroplasticity within the 5-HT raphe-striatal circuit as a foremost factor in the development and expression
of LID and in so doing, identify optimal treatment strategies to improve the quality of life for millions of current and
prospective PD patients.

 Cardiometabolic (CM) diseases including cardiovascular (CV) and metabolic diseases are the leading
cause of preventable death in the United States and Worldwide. CM diseases are interconnected and positively
associated with multi-domain Cardiometabolic Risk Factors (CMRFs) such as metabolic dysregulation, obesity,
physical inactivity, poor nutrition, and other emerging factors (including and especially sleep disorders). CMRFs
are highly and increasingly prevalent in adolescents and young adults, which foreshadows a future
epidemic of incident CM diseases as they age. However, existing studies have primarily focused on the adult
and senior population with little to no knowledge on the young population.
CM data hold great promise to facilitate CM subgroup discovery for early risk stratification and precise
prognosis. However, significant gaps exist in fully leveraging CM data. Gap I: Lack of inclusion of multi-
domain CMRFs (especially sleep health). Gap II: Lack of “outcome-predictive” CM subgroups in early risk
stratification. Gap III: Lack of “subgroup-specific” precise prognosis of “multi-dimensional” CM outcomes. Gap
IV: Under-utilization of the rich but “incomplete” multi-domain CM data in NHANES and NSRR. We propose a
multi-study multi-domain secondary analysis for CM subgroup discovery and risk prediction in U.S. adolescents
(11-18) and young adults (19-39). The objective is to create 2 combined NHANES and NSRR datasets and
examine multi-domain CMRFs including metabolic dysregulation, physical inactivity, poor nutrition, and multi-
dimensional sleep measures for CM subgroup discovery and risk prediction in the large and diverse U.S.
adolescent and young adult population of Hispanics/Latinos, African Americans, Caucasians, and Asian
Americans. Aim 1. CM risk subgroup discovery at baseline for U.S. adolescents & young adults. (1.1) Develop
a novel sparse Incomplete Multi-domain Mixed-typed Factor Mixture Model (IM2-FMM) for subgroup discovery
from incomplete multi-domain mixed-typed CMRFs. (1.2) Apply IM2-FMM to identify, characterize, and evaluate
CM subgroups in adolescents and young adults from incomplete multi-domain mixed-typed CMRFs at baseline
including: (a) self-reported sleep measures in NHANES; (b) self-reported and objective sleep measures in NSRR.
Aim 2. Subgroup-specific prediction of multi-dimensional longitudinal CM outcomes for young adults. (2.1)
Develop a novel sparse Transfer Learning-based Generalized Multi-level Model (TL-GMM) to predict multi-
dimensional longitudinal CM outcomes from clustered CMRFs at baseline. (2.2) Apply TL-GMM to young adults
in NSRR to: (1) examine fixed effects and random effects of baseline CMRFs on CM outcomes; (2) provide
subgroup-specific multi-dimensional prognosis of CM health from clustered CMRFs at baseline. Impact: Our
study will generate novel insights into CM subgroup discovery to facilitate early and targeted interventions and
help establish health promoting behaviors in adolescents and young adults, eventually improving CM health care
in their transition to adulthood and reducing CM health disparities and costs as the young population ages.

The cell nucleus is bi-directionally transported and positioned in a cell cycle specific manner, a process that is
important for cell cycle control as well as brain and muscle development. The importance of nuclear positioning
for brain and muscle development is underscored by the fact that human disease mutations of proteins
engaged in the transport of the nucleus cause severe brain and muscle development diseases, including
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), hereditary spastic paraplegia and spinal muscular atrophy, which is the
most common genetic cause of death in infants. Yet, it is unknown how teams of opposing motor complexes
collaborate to achieve correct timing, directionality and velocity of transport. Notably, the interactions of
opposing motors with cargoes have not been characterized by biochemical or structural methods as proposed
here. The nuclear pore complex protein Nup358 provides recruitment sites at the nuclear envelope for the
opposing motor complexes dynein and kinesin-1, which can bind simultaneously and facilitate bi-directional
positioning of the nucleus along microtubules. This pathway is important for faithful chromosome segregation
and essential for a fundamental process in brain development that is required for brain progenitor cells to
differentiate to neurons and other cell types. Dynein adapters such as Bicaudal D2 (BicD2) have key roles in
transport, as they select cargoes and are required to activate dynein for processive motility; however, the
underlying molecular mechanism is unknown.
We plan: 1) To establish how dynein motility is modulated by dynein adapter/cargo complexes and by kinesin-
1. 2) to establish a structural basis for recognition of the cell nucleus as cargo by dynein adapters. 3) To
establish whether dynein and kinesin-1 are recruited in a cooperative manner to Nup358 at the nucleus, i.e.
whether binding of the first motor changes the affinity for the second motor. We plan to establish how
BicD2/cargo complexes activate dynein for processive motility. Furthermore we plan to assess how kinesin-1
modulates motility of the dynein/BicD2/Nup358 complex.
Our approach combines NMR spectroscopy, X-ray crystallography and biophysical methods, which are
integrated with single-molecule processivity assays with intact dynein and kinesin-1 motors. Results will
establish a structural basis for cargo selection by BicD2. Our study serves as a model system to understand
how cargo adapters regulate the motility and directionality of cargo transported bi-directionally by both dynein
and kinesin-1, which is important as these motors facilitate a vast number of cellular transport events that are
essential for chromosome segregation, signal transmission at synapses, brain and muscle development. More
specifically, results will establish how correctly timed bi-directional transport of the nucleus is regulated, which
is crucial for cell cycle control, muscle and brain development. Mutations of proteins of these pathways cause
devastating neuromuscular diseases, and results will help devise therapies for these diseases.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：After a tissue is infected, the invading pathogen must be controlled and the tissue must be repaired or
else long-term morbidity and mortality will ensue. Toxoplasma gondii infections result in a
non-resolving chronic infection with tissue cysts residing preferentially in skeletal muscle and the
central nervous system. In contrast to the brain little is known about the immune response and
immune-regulation in the infected muscle. Foxp3-expressing CD4+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) play a
key role in controlling the immune response to infection and aid in tissue repair. Yet, we have found
during chronic T. gondii infection muscle Tregs become pathogenic and cause inflammation instead
of preventing it. We have shown these Tregs are Th1-polarized but do not produce IFNγ. Tregs in T.
gondii-infected muscle produce low levels of amphiregulin, a cytokine critical in repairing
immune-mediated pathology. We showed that Toxoplasma-induced immunopathology in muscle can
be ameliorated by recombinant treatment with amphiregulin in chronically infected mice and returning
function to the tissue. However it is unclear how amphiregulin mediates this effect. The overarching
hypothesis for this proposal is that T-bet expression in skeletal muscle Tregs drives this pathogenic
function by dampening production of key factors associated with normally suppressive Treg function.
This hypothesis will be addressed in the following specific aims: (1) identify how T-bet drives the
pathogenic function of Tregs in infected muscle and (2) define the role of amphiregulin in infected
muscle during Toxoplasma infection. How a chronic infection alters the highly orchestrated
immune-mediated regeneration of muscle is still poorly understood. Loss of muscle mass predicts
reduced quality of life and often increased morbidity for chronically ill patients and so a better
understanding of what drives this process is needed for directing therapeutic interventions.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Uncontrolled Toxoplasma growth is the primary mechanism by which the parasite causes
severe and life-threatening disease. The parasite replicates by a process termed endodyogeny,
where two daughter parasites form within a single mother. A key step in endodyogeny is formation
of the daughter cell inner membrane complex, which is an unique organelle that lies directly
underneath the plasma membrane and is required for parasite motility and replication. During
daughter cell development, the nascent IMC emerges from a complex named the daughter cell
scaffold (DCS). Despite its importance, the DCS is poorly characterized and few of its constituent
proteins are known. Here, we hypothesize that the Toxoplasma F-box protein, TgFBXO1, is a
critical component of the DCS. To test our hypothesis, we will determine: i) how TgFBXO1 is
targeted to the DCS, ii) how TgFBXO1 regulates inner membrane complex development and
organization, and iii) which TgFBXO1-interacting proteins are important for inner membrane
complex development. Together, these studies will provide in depth mechanistic detail for a
protein complex that is critical for growth of an important protozoan pathogen. Furthermore, they
were serve as a springboard for future studies aimed at developing novel anti-parasitic drugs that
function by targeting this complex.

urgent public health threat in the US and around the globe. New Delhi Metallo-β-lactamases (NDM)
producing CRE are particularly concerning as they have rapidly spread worldwide and can efficiently co-
exist with a plethora of Gram-negative resistance determinants including Extended Spectrum β-lactamases
(ESBLs), carbapenemases, and polymyxin resistance genes. We have reported the first US case of
polymyxin- and carbapenem-resistant E. coli producing New Delhi Metallo-beta-lactamase (NDM-5)
together with mobile colistin resistance (MCR-1) in a patient. The recent report of pan-drug-resistant (PDR),
K. pneumoniae (NDM-1, ESBLs, and polymyxin resistance determinants), from a patient in Nevada further
highlights that it may be only a matter of time until hospitals in the US and worldwide face an outbreak of
these Gram-negative ‘superbugs’. It is critical to prepare therapeutics for the future occurrence of NDM
strains which harbor a diverse array of resistance determinants. Our Central Hypothesis is that rationally
optimized antibiotic combination dosing strategies will achieve extensive killing and prevent emergence of
resistance against of NDM-producing Enterobactericeae. Our preliminary studies provide compelling
evidence in support of our innovative combinations. We established the first highly efficient cassette assay
to assess target site penetration of β-lactams in the presence of polymyxins, the first dataset on β-lactam
receptor binding in K. pneumoniae, and show that new 4-drug combination regimens eradicated NDM and
ESBL co-producing K. pneumoniae and prevented resistance. In Aim 1, we will create genetically
engineered strains, as well as assess the target site penetration and receptor binding of β-lactam antibiotics
and β-lactamase inhibitors, and the enhanced penetration in presence of polymyxins. In Aim 2, in vitro
pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics models, including the dynamic Hollow Fiber Infection Model, will
evaluate optimized dosing strategies for 3- and 4-drug combinations by profiling the time course of bacterial
killing, suppression of resistance, and persister eradication. Genomics and transcriptomics will be utilized to
understand why monotherapies and non-optimized combinations failed with resistance. In Aim 3, our latest
Quantitative and Systems Pharmacology (QSP) modelling approach will guide translation across all
experimental tiers. Prospective validation of these novel optimal combination dosing strategies will be
completed in murine pneumonia models with an intact and impaired immune system. This will yield
innovative combination dosage regimens against pandrug-resistant CRE that can suppress resistance.
Thus, this project will address an urgent, global medical need. This project will provide the first
mechanistically informed, rationally optimized and prospectively validated combination dosing strategies of
available antibiotics against resistant Gram-negatives that will be ready for testing in future clinical trials.

In Alzheimer’s disease (AD) research, a big challenge is the identification and targeting of key molecules in
critical neural circuits that play a causal role in cognitive impairment at the early stage before global
neurodegeneration. We hypothesize that transcriptional downregulation of selective neuronal genes in early AD
initiates the loss of synaptic function in specific brain circuits, leading to cognitive decline. In Aim 1, we will identify
transcriptomic changes at the early stage of AD using human postmortem tissues and iPSC-derived cortical
neurons. Comprehensive bioinformatic analyses of large-scale bulk and single-cell RNAseq data from
postmortem human with ‘early-pathology’ and ‘late-pathology’ of AD will be performed to identify prominent
changes in gene networks, molecular pathways and biological processes at different stages. Given the limitation
of postmortem tissues in capturing early molecular alterations, we will also profile transcriptional changes using
human cortical neurons differentiated from iPSCs of sporadic AD patients. Based on our preliminary data, the
loss of selective presynaptic and postsynaptic genes involved in vesicle release and glutamatergic/GABAergic
transmission is the major early change in cortical neurons of AD patients. In Aim 2, we will identify
electrophysiological changes using AD mouse models and iPSC-derived cortical neurons from AD patients. We
will use in vivo multichannel recording of action potential spikes, optogenetic isolation of neural pathways and
ex vivo patch-clamp recording of synaptic currents in AD mouse models to obtain the high-resolution mapping
of cognitive circuits that go awry at various stages. In Aim 3, we will identify intervention strategies to rescue AD-
associated functional deficits in AD mouse models and iPSC-derived cortical neurons from AD patients. Guided
by the identified molecular and circuitry changes in AD, we will use viral-based approaches to normalize gene
expression or neuronal activity in specific circuits, and examine the impact on synaptic transmission and
cognitive behaviors in AD mouse models. This study will uncover transcriptomic and circuitry aberrations in early
stage of AD, and help to develop mechanism-based therapeutic strategies to mitigate synaptic deficits and
improve cognition.

Ventricular tachyarrhythmias are responsible for 300,000 sudden cardiac deaths a year in the US. The
mechanisms underlying these arrhythmias in the majority of cases are ventricular tachycardia (VT) and/or
ventricular fibrillation (VF). The ever-increasing prevalence of obesity also poses a significant burden on
the health care system with increased morbidity and mortality. Importantly, obesity has been associated
with cardiac arrhythmias with increased risk of sudden cardiac death linked to increased adiposity.
However, the mechanisms by which obesity could result in ventricular arrhythmias (VT/VF) remain
incompletely understood. In this proposal, I plan to use a multimodal and multiscale approach to
characterize VT/VF in donor human hearts associated with sustained obesity. In the mentored phase of
this project, I will use donor hearts to investigate the role of epicardial adiposity in promoting VT/VF via
paracrine signaling, while also getting specialized training in bioinformatics and adipocyte biology. In the
independent phase of this project, I will use donor hearts to investigate the role of epicardial adiposity in
generating arrhythmogenic triggers. The experiments outlined below will advance our understanding of
VT/VF mechanisms and also serve as proof-of-concept for future experiments designed to develop new
markers to predict and treat VT/VF vulnerability in a clinical setting.

KL2 Mentored Career Development Award. The CTSA-Linked KL2 mentored career development award
program (KL2 program) will strive to engage talented and motivated scholars to join the clinical and translational
science workforce with the goal of developing new diagnostic, preventive, and therapeutic interventions for
diseases, with an emphasis on addressing health disparities. The KL2 program has stimulated clinical and
translational research across the Buffalo Translational Consortium (BTC) by attracting, mentoring, training and
engaging scholars with diverse cultural, ethnic, racial and professional backgrounds and across scientific
disciplines (i.e. RN-PhDs, PharmDs, PhDs, MDs, and/or DDS-PhDs). These scholars receive an
interprofessional and interdisciplinary education where they learn with, about, and from each other, enabling
effective collaboration and discoveries in clinical and translational research. In the proposed funding period, the
KL2 program will train at least four junior faculty physician scientist scholars by supporting them for two years
on their path to independence, with the option of receiving an additional third year of institutional funding upon
completion of the program curriculum and objective evaluation of scholarly accomplishments. The program is
complemented by and integrated with the institutionally-funded BTC scholars program, allowing us to train five
(three in years 1-3; two in years 3-5) additional scholars under the same terms during the next funding period.
Integration of all scholars’ activities under our well-established mentoring and training program brings together
a critical mass of diverse professional experiences and talent benefiting all involved. The KL2 program has three
specific aims towards these goals are: 1) attract skilled and motivated early career clinical and translational
investigators from a broad range of health science disciplines, including individuals underrepresented in health
science; 2) provide comprehensive tailored support to mentor and train the scholars to promote pathways to
independence; and 3) engage scholars, facilitate interactions and enhance communications with the community
to raise awareness and accelerate solutions for health disparities. Innovations in our KL2 program include the
awarding of digital badges followed by micro-credentials, which are competency-based documentation of training
in specific areas; inclusion of community agency advisors and partners on scholars’ mentoring teams, aligning
with our goal to address health disparities in our community; and extensive partnering with other CTSA hubs.
The program will mentor, train and develop KL2 scholars’ professional skills and facilitate a seamless transition
to their next career level in the clinical and translational workforce. The overall goal of this KL2 program is to
develop the next generation of 21st century leaders whose backgrounds mirror the diversity of our community to
enhance excellence in clinical and translational research, locally and across the nation.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) are Gram-positive bacteria responsible for 1.6 million deaths
globally each year. Available pneumococcal vaccines have reduced efficacy in the elderly, and despite
vaccination, S. pneumoniae remain the leading cause of bacterial community-acquired pneumonia in adults over
the age of 65. This decline in vaccine efficacy is driven by immunosenescence, the age-associated decline in
immune function. Polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) are cells of the innate immune system and are required
for host defense against S. pneumoniae infection. PMNs isolated from aged hosts display a significant reduction
in pneumococcal killing when compared to PMNs from young hosts. This reduction in killing persists despite
opsonization of bacteria with specific anti-pneumococcal antibodies, however, the signaling pathways driving
this decline in PMN function and the role of PMNs in the age-related reduction in vaccine efficacy remain unclear.
One pathway that controls PMN antibacterial responses is the extracellular adenosine pathway but the role of
this pathway in vaccinated hosts and how it changes with age remain unexplored. This led to the hypothesis
that with age, there is a decline in intracellular bacterial killing following antibody mediated uptake of S.
pneumoniae, which is driven by changes in adenosine receptor signaling. This hypothesis will be tested using
two specific aims: 1) Identify why intracellular killing of S. pneumoniae is defective in PMNs from old mice and
2) Identify the role of adenosine receptor signaling in the age-driven decline in intracellular killing of S.
pneumoniae by PMNs. This project is significant as it will identify the mechanism of the age-related changes in
PMN function following antibody mediated uptake of S. pneumoniae. Additionally, PMNs are involved in host
defense against multiple pathogens, therefore this work may provide a potential therapeutic target to boost
overall vaccine protectiveness in aged hosts. The overall goal of this research training plan is to strengthen the
candidate’s knowledge in host-pathogen interactions, immunology, and immunosenescence. As well as to
advance technical skills in microscopy, signaling, and cell biology techniques. These aims and goals will be
accomplished with the guidance of the qualified mentoring team assembled by the candidate and will be aided
by the opportunities offered by the training environment at the University at Buffalo Jacobs School of Medicine
and Biomedical Sciences. These resources will provide the necessary training and support to complete the
proposed research and guide the candidate’s future career in academia.

Ministry of Health. The scientific focus for the D43 GID renewal will be major endemic or life threatening emerging
viral infectious diseases and chronic viral infections including an emphasis on arbovirus and vector research,
COVID-19, chronic viral infection and antiviral drug development. This is based on the continued need for
building the research workforce to address these areas while recognizing the ongoing impact of COVID-19. The
initial GID program was focused on establishing a new initiative at The UWI Mona Campus for pre-doctoral and
post-doctoral candidates with an interest in virology research. The GID program was highly successful as
measured by outcome metrics including recruitment, training goals achieved and scientific dissemination. The
GID recruited ten outstanding scientists of whom 70% are women. The prior GID program established a research
training metric (RTM) that was scored 1-10 and included criteria such as responsible conduct of research training,
external seminars, degree-required courses, research proposal/protocol, IRB/ethics compliance, a research
project plan, project budget, and scientific writing. An RTM score of 9-10 was achieved by 70% of the trainees.
The GID trainees contributed to 11 manuscripts. The renewal GID will train 10 new independent researchers (5
pre-doctoral, 5 post-doctoral) with expertise in one or more of the following areas: arbovirology, viral hepatitis,
chronic viral infection, antiviral drug development, bioinformatics, omics, and epidemiology. Our experienced
GID mentors will be complemented by new faculty mentors who will provide innovative laboratory research
opportunities in vector biology, primate research, omics, molecular diagnostics, flow cytometry and mass
spectrometry with a customized curriculum based on each trainee’s Individualized Development Plan (IDP) to
achieve a personalized Virology Research Skills Toolbox. Trainees will complete short-term, mentored training
in US-based laboratories directed by faculty mentors with extensive experience in virology, immunology, omics
and pharmacology research. The GID renewal will continue to address the important public health challenges
related to infectious diseases and build on the successes of the initial GID research training program in Jamaica.

lamivudine and dolutegravir, long-acting ARVs (e.g., cabotegravir, rilpivirine), new ARVs (e.g., lenacapavir,
islatravir) and HIV-1 broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNABs), clinical and translational research related to these
new therapeutic agents is needed to examine the optimal pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamics parameters that
will prevent transmission and/or sustain viral load suppression as well as safety in the context of co-morbidities.
Training of clinician-scientists and translational scientists will utilize the foundation that has been built by the prior
UB-UZ HIVRT and transition to the newly designed research training program. Specific Aims: 1) Provide a HIVRT
for pre-doctoral (5) and post-doctoral (5) trainees that increases the number of researchers with independent,
funded programs with a focus on HIV clinical pharmacology and therapeutics and regional public health priorities
including COVID-19, 2) Mentor HIVRT trainees in team science and that include others with expertise in
pharmaceutical bioanalysis, biomedical informatics, data sciences, genomics, and microbiome, 3) Foster
community support group engagement to participate in innovative research to study novel HIV clinical
pharmacology and therapeutics strategies for prevention and treatment and investigate long-acting
antiretrovirals and monoclonal antibodies and traditional medicines, and 4) Provide an HIVRT that fosters smart
academic-public-private partnerships aimed at addressing sustainable developmental goals. Trainees will have
intensive training at UB during which new knowledge and skills will allow formulation of a research project that
will be conducted under continued supervision for 18 months at UZ for a total of two years of training. The
program will build on our prior Fogarty International Center HIV Research Training program, and an earlier
AITRP. These research training programs provide the foundation for this D43 renewal that includes an
outstanding group of UZ and UB mentors who will provide mentoring and collaboration utilizing the HIV Clinical
Pharmacology and Therapeutics foundation that has been built for HIV clinical and translational research. The
curriculum will be organized and provided through an established Research and Education Training Core. The

The ability to move from one place to another and acquire different motor skills is critical for our survival. Many
human disorders including Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and Tourette syndrome, cause
abnormal motor behaviors. Identifying neural circuits that mediate locomotion and motor learning are therefore
crucial both in terms of basic science and understanding how their dysfunction in disease models may
contribute to motor defects. Parafascicular (PF) thalamus has extensive connectivity within the basal ganglia
motor system, and is involved in reversal learning as well as the initiation of movement sequences. Although
heterogeneity within PF thalamic neurons has been reported at the cellular level, the functional relevance of
distinct PF subpopulations in motor behaviors remains unknown. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that
PF thalamus contains distinct projection-specific subpopulations that mediate different motor processes.
During the K99 phase, using chemogenetic neuronal inhibition and in vivo calcium imaging, I will test the
hypothesis that the thalamostriatal (PF!dorsal striatum) pathway is mainly involved in locomotion whereas the
thalamosubthalamic (PF!subthalamic nucleus) pathway is mainly involved in motor learning. By comparing
inputs from motor cortex, globus pallidus, and substantia nigra to these PF subpopulations followed by
optogenetic circuit manipulations, I will identify PF subpopulation-specific inputs that are critical for their
behavioral contributions. During the R00 phase, using ex vivo electrophysiology, I will determine how these two
PF circuits are altered in a mouse model of Parkinson's disease, which will set the stage for the identification of
circuit-based manipulations that may rescue both locomotion and motor learning in this mouse model. To
further these rescue experiments, I will perform single cell RNA sequencing of the two PF subpopulations in
wild type mice to identify potential molecular targets capable of rescuing both motor phenotypes in Parkinson's
disease mice. Together, the proposed project will not only enhance our understanding regarding the role of
distinct PF circuits in motor functions, but also potentially indicate that targeting PF circuits may be sufficient to
rescue multiple motor phenotypes in neurodegenerative disease models. The proposed research and career
development plan will be conducted in the lab of Dr. Guoping Feng at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard,
which will prepare Dr. Dheeraj Roy to direct an innovative research program as an independent investigator
studying neural circuit mechanisms mediating normal and disease states.

 Dysfunction and death of neurons severely affect the quality of life, yet therapeutic options remain
limited. Recent studies demonstrated clinic potential to replace lost neurons, e.g., transplanting of hESC-
derived retinal cells improves disrupted visual acuity. However, research progress is hindered by limited
mechanistic understanding of how to program cells into mature states for proper neurite outgrowth. Neurons
undergo dramatic remodeling during development to become fully mature. This conserved process consists of
precisely regulated pruning and outgrowth of neurites, facilitated by accurate transcriptome dynamics. How
chromatin is organized to achieve the dynamic transcriptome during this process remains undefined. My long-
term goal is to study epigenetic mechanisms underlying neuronal maturation and promote their application
toward studies with clinic potential to improve life quality. This proposed project uses both Drosophila and
mouse as model systems to study insulator regulation of 3D chromatin organization during neuronal outgrowth.
CTCF is a conserved insulator protein that plays a central role in 3D chromatin organization. Shep is a
conserved RNA/DNA-binding protein that is essential for proper neuronal outgrowth. My preliminary data
indicate that Shep antagonizes CTCF insulator to promote neuronal outgrowth of fly. Here I am proposing
three aims to investigate epigenetic mechanisms underlying my preliminary findings: 1) Determine neuron-
specific Shep regulation of 3D chromatin organization at its target loci in fly. 2) Investigate neuron-specific
mechanisms by which Shep antagonizes CTCF insulator function in fly. 3) Elucidate Shep and CTCF function
in regulating morphological and physiological maturation of mouse neurons. This project will employ extensive
neuron-specific high throughput sequencing coupled with physiological assays to reveal molecular
mechanisms underlying neuronal remodeling in both fly and mouse. These data will provide novel insights into
epigenetic regulation of neuronal maturation and suggest compelling mechanisms for studies with medical and
clinic potential. My career goal is to create my independent research group, employing fly as an efficient tool to
reveal mechanisms that are subsequently tested in the mouse model. My mentor Dr. Elissa Lei's group has
long been studying insulator-mediated chromatin organization and gene expression. I will get extensive training
in epigenetics, including scientific knowledge and technical skills to generate sequencing libraries in the Lei
group. My co-mentor Dr. Jeff Diamond will provide essential training on mouse neuroscience and physiology.
My second co-mentor Dr. Victor Corces will provide both scientific advice on epigenetic studies and guidance
on career development once I establish my lab at a university. The K99/R00 award will assist me to achieve
my goals by providing essential resource and funding at my mentored-stage and my early independent phase.

This proposal is being submitted to support the transition of Dr. Dominguez-Lopez from mentored trainee to
an independent investigator in the neurobiology of drug addiction, specifically studying the dopamine
microcircuits controlling drug-seeking behavior. Dr. Dominguez-Lopez works under the mentorship of Dr.
Michael Beckstead at the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation (OMRF) investigating the role of
dopamine neurotransmission in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) in methamphetamine (METH) self-
administration behavior. Dr. Beckstead is a recognized expert in dopamine synaptic transmission in the fields
of addiction. Dr. Beckstead’s laboratory combines mouse models of drug self-administration with patch-clamp
electrophysiology and immunocytochemistry, providing a dynamic environment for Dr. Dominguez-Lopez to
become an experienced scientist. The submitted proposal incorporates scientific training in methodologies to
study mitochondrial metabolism, transcriptional analysis, bioinformatics and genetic labeling of active
neuronal populations. The applicant will be receiving training in educational methods, scientific writing, grant
preparation and other skills necessary to become an independent brain research scientist from an
underrepresented group. The proposed program includes mentoring interactions with Dr. Holly Van Remmen,
Dr. Willard Freeman, Dr. Linda Thompson, members of OMRF, and Dr. Rajeshwar Awatramani from
Northwestern University in Chicago. The short-term objective of this application is to enhance Dr. Dominguez-
Lopez’s knowledge of mitochondrial metabolism and single cell transcriptomics applied to dopaminergic
circuits. In the long-term, this will enable Dr. Dominguez-Lopez to secure protected time for training and
research activities, establish new collaborations, and pursue his novel independent research resulting in
competitive grant proposals. Preliminary data obtained by Dr. Dominguez-Lopez indicates that prolonged
METH self-administration in mice produces a decrease of dopamine neurons in the VTA, decreases dopamine
cell excitability, increases mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate and decreases levels of glutathione. These
observations are concurrent with increased drug-seeking behavior. This research proposal expands on those
findings to identify metabolic and molecular characteristics in dopamine circuits that provide resistance or
vulnerability to METH exposure. The central hypothesis is that a subpopulation of VTA dopamine neurons is
responsible for METH-seeking behavior, forming a microcircuit that is resistant to mitochondrial oxidative
stress induced by chronic METH exposure. The proposed aims are 1) Identification of VTA dopamine
microcircuits encoding METH-seeking behavior, and 2) Metabolic characteristics of VTA dopamine neurons
encoding METH-seeking behavior. Identification of the specific brain circuits responsible for METH addictive
properties is a first step to develop therapeutic strategies to help addicts recover from METH addiction.

The Buffalo Translational Consortium (BTC), which includes the University at Buffalo (UB) health sciences
schools, the major healthcare institutions in our region, four key research institutes and five influential community
partners, have embarked on a comprehensive strategic plan to build a strong foundation for clinical and
translational research in response to our community needs. Buffalo is the second most populous city in New
York State and has a rich cultural history. The proportion of underrepresented minorities in Buffalo in 2018 (50%)
parallels that projected for the US in 2050, making Buffalo a microcosm of what the US will look like in 30 years.
A similar proportion of our population experiences health disparities. The vision for our CTSA hub is to perform
innovative research across the translational spectrum to improve the health of our community and the nation.
We will develop, test and share novel approaches to engage difficult-to-engage populations and reduce health
disparities in our community, which represents a “population of the future”. Guided by our vision, the CTSA has
catalyzed a transformation of our environment since our CTSA was first funded in August 2015 with remarkable
growth in clinical and translational research. Further, in just the past year, the UB medical school has moved into
a spectacular new building and our clinical partner, Kaleida Health, the largest healthcare system in the region,
opened the new Oishei Children’s Hospital, both on the Buffalo Niagara Medical Campus and connected to the
Clinical and Translational Research Center devoted entirely to clinical and translational research that opened in
2012. This rapid and continuing trajectory of growth in healthcare and research in the region has resulted in a
new 21st century Academic Health Center with healthcare, medical education and clinical and translational
research on one campus in the heart of Buffalo, creating a foundation to enhance the impact of our CTSA even
further. While launching our CTSA, we have prioritized participation in the national consortium through hosting
and testing Innovation Labs as a team science tool, working with multiple hubs on initiatives to solve translational
research barriers and sharing tools that we have developed with the CTSA consortium, including novel health
informatics tools. Our CTSA has five ambitious but achievable aims, including: 1) Accelerate innovative
translational research with teams that engage communities, regional stakeholders and the national consortium;
2) Train an excellent, diverse workforce to advance translation of discoveries; 3) Enhance inclusion of special
populations across the lifespan and difficult-to-engage populations; 4) Streamline clinical research processes
focusing on quality and efficiency with emphasis on multisite studies; 5) Develop, test and share biomedical
informatics tools to integrate data from multiple sources to speed translation. Guided by our vision to perform
research to improve the health of our community and the nation, we will continue our momentum to expand
translational research, train our diverse workforce, streamline processes, engage our community, and actively
contribute to the national consortium.

Lower-income and minority groups face significant health disparities with respect to obesity, cancer, heart
disease and other diet-related chronic conditions. Poor diets, low in fruits and vegetables (F&V) and high in
saturated fat, sodium and sugar, contribute to many of the health problems faced by vulnerable groups. While
socioeconomic status and other individual level factors (i.e., food preferences, time and skills to prepare
healthy food, etc.) can lead to reduced F&V consumption, these must be viewed in an environmental context.
Compared with higher-income neighborhoods, lower-income and minority neighborhoods are less likely to
have stores that sell a variety of F&V and other healthy foods. And when stores are available, produce may
not be affordable, high quality or culturally appropriate. Farmers' markets and mobile produce markets (MM)
have become increasingly popular strategies to alleviate food access concerns in underserved communities.
However, it is unclear if these programs have the necessary components to have an appreciable impact on
diet. Our research team recently completed one of the first randomized controlled trials of a MM program called
the Veggie Van. Veggie Van was run in partnership with our team and a small non-profit organization in North
Carolina; it delivered boxes of fresh, locally grown produce and food-focused education to communities with
significant barriers to F&V consumption including availability, affordability, quality and knowledge. In this small
cluster-randomized trial in 12 communities (N=201), we saw impressive changes in F&V intake with
intervention participants eating almost 1 more cups per day of F&Vs than the control group. Intervention
participants also reported increases in perceived access to healthy foods and Veggie Van customers attributed
many dietary changes to the MM program. While these results are very promising, we believe it is important to
test the effectiveness of the Veggie Van program when implemented by different organizations in multiple
communities. If shown to be effective, we can create a research-tested intervention toolkit which can be
disseminated to communities across the country. For this research, we will use a request for proposals
process to identify 8 organizations nationwide that are well-qualified to implement the Veggie Van model.
Organizations will identify appropriate sites for MM deliveries (32 total) and we will randomize them to either an
implementation or planning condition. With the help of our team's technical assistance and provided funding,
partner organizations will engage community members in the process and initiate a MM program. We will use
a Type 1 Hybrid Effectiveness-Implementation to measure effectiveness (diet, BMI, dermal carotenoids) and
implementation (customer reach and sales, process measures, qualitative interviews with MM staff). We will
also examine sustainability of MM financial models and determine implementation standards (i.e., dose needed
to maintain impact) for inclusion in our MM toolkit for future dissemination.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：This project will characterize the functional properties of NMDA receptors that lack N-terminal and C-terminal
domains, herein referred to as minimal receptors. These proteins consist of the core machinery of NMDA
receptors and include the extracellular agonist-binding domain (ABD) connected to the ion-permeable pore
formed by the transmembrane (TMD) domain. In the parent project, we were successful in using a structural
model of this minimal receptor to envision the opening trajectory of NMDA receptors, using molecular dynamics
simulations. However, it is unknown whether the minimal receptors are functional and therefore whether they
represent a suitable model for further structure-function investigations, based on the hypotheses generated by
our simulations. In this application, we propose to investigate the hypothesis that minimal NMDA receptors
display glutamate-mediated ionotropy. Our preliminary results demonstrate that minimal receptors respond to
glutamate by producing excitatory currents that differ in kinetics from wild-type receptors. By delineating
commonalities and differences between the activation mechanism of minimal NMDA receptors and native
receptors, results from this project will provide information necessary for the correct interpretation of results
from molecular dynamics simulations.

Post-translational modification of N-terminal α-amino groups is a highly conserved and vastly utilized process
seen in all species from bacteria to mammals. Dr. Schaner Tooley pioneered the field of N-terminal
methylation by identifying the first two eukaryotic N-terminal methyltransferases, NRMT1 and NRMT2. She
went on to characterize the consensus sequence of these enzymes, identify dozens of their substrates, and
show N-terminal methylation regulates protein/DNA interactions. Her lab was also the first to show that, like
histone PTMs, Nα-PTMs are part of a functional code. They identified the first protein known to exist in both
Nα-acetyl and Nα-methyl forms, Myosin Light Chain 9 (MYL9). They demonstrated that these two Nα-PTMs
create distinct proteoforms of MYL9, with unique protein binding partners, internal PTM patterns, and cell
compartment-specific functions. They have also demonstrated important roles for NRMT1 in oncogenesis
and aging. NRMT1 loss in breast cancer cells promotes proliferation, migration, colony formation, and
xenograph growth. NRMT1 knockout in mice promotes phenotypes associated with premature aging,
including early graying, kyphosis, and dermal fibrosis. They now want to expand understanding of the
biochemistry of NRMT1 regulation, identify additional substrates regulated by the Nα-PTM code, and
mechanistically characterize a newly discovered role for NRMT1 in stem cell fate determination. Successful
completion of these goals will provide a more global understanding of NRMT1 function and help better
develop NRMT1 as a therapeutic for human cancers and age-related disorders.

Environmental contamination by per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) is a major public health concern
because of the wide range of toxic effects that have been associated with exposure to these persistent chemicals.
Due to the strong stability of the C-F bond, very few microorganisms have been found capable of degrading
PFASs, and the biodegradation is very slow and incomplete. Often, bioremediation efforts result in the formation
of shorter chain PFASs that remain toxic, persistent, and highly mobile in the environment. Current abiotic
treatment technologies can be more effective, but have very high energy requirements. Therefore, this research
proposes an innovative remediation strategy that couples a pre-treatment step using catalytic hybrid
nanomaterials with biodegradation using enriched microbial communities to achieve more efficient and complete
destruction of PFASs without the formation of toxic by-products. Multifunctional reduced graphene oxide-metallic
nanohybrids (e.g. rGO-nZVI-TiO2) that are capable of catalyzing defluorination and oxidation of PFASs will be
synthesized and characterized for their efficiencies in converting highly stable PFASs to more biodegradable
forms. Pure cultures (e.g. Dehalococcoides sp. and Dehalobacter sp.) and enriched microbial consortia collected
from PFAS-contaminated sites and anaerobic wastewater treatment plants will be used to degrade different
types of PFASs and measure their removal efficacy. Using metagenomic and transcriptomic tools, the
microorganisms responsible for degradation, their functional characteristics, and the genes being transcribed
during defluorination will be identified. By-products formed at each step of the pre-treatment reaction, and during
the course of the microbial degradation of PFASs will be characterized using liquid chromatography with high-
resolution mass spectrometry, 19F-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and ion chromatography to obtain
information on the identities of PFASs transformation products, degradation kinetics, and mass balance.
Molecular modeling will be used to bring mechanistic insight into specific PFAS-surface and PFAS-enzyme
interactions. The effect of the structural features of PFASs (i.e. branching, chain-length, type of head groups) on
their biodegradability will be systematically evaluated, first by molecular modeling, and then by experimental
validation. Knowledge from the chemical characterization of PFASs degradation by-products combined with in
silico site-directed mutagenesis will facilitate the tuning of enzymatic activities and discovery of novel bacteria
that are efficient degraders of PFASs from the natural environment. These insights will guide the systematic
design of highly efficient nano-enhanced bioremediation systems for complete microbial degradation of PFASs.

The pathogenic fungus Cryptococcus neoformans continues to be the cause of 15% of AIDS-related mortality,
primarily in under-resourced areas of the globe. The work outlined in the proposal is a continuation of work
investigating post-transcriptional and translational mechanisms of stress adaptation in this important fungal
pathogen and investigate their conservation across clinical isolates from AIDS-associated cryptococcosis in
Africa. We have implicated translatome reprogramming as a requirement for the adaptation to host-
temperature stress as well as oxidative stress. This reprogramming is regulated at two points: the entry of
mRNAs into the translating pool through regulation of translation initiation, and the removal of mRNAs from the
pool by deadenylation-dependent mRNA decay. These two pathways cooperate in a stress-specific and
intensity-dependent manner to achieve a stress-adaptive translatome. In this proposal, we propose three
specific aims that outline a mechanistic investigation of these processes. First, we will investigate the
translational regulation of Gcn4, the transcription factor that controls expression of the integrated stress
response (ISR) regulon. We will define the C. neoformans ISR, and define the direct targets of Gcn4 in C.
neoformans. Second, we will build on preliminary data demonstrating that translation initiation regulation by the
kinase Gcn2 is activated by perturbations in other post-transcriptional and translation regulatory pathways
suggesting a role for Gcn2 as a failsafe responder to stress. We will investigate the contributions to
translatome reprogramming of these additional pathways, Hog1/p38, Nonsense Mediate Decay (NMD) and
Ribosome Quality Control (RQC) and investigate the role of Gcn2 activation in either suppressing or
exacerbating defects in translatome reprogramming or virulence phenotype. Finally, we will investigate the
mechanisms of translatome reprogramming in a panel of environmental C. neoformans isolates, as well as a
large collection of clinical isolates of C. neoformans from people with AIDS-associated cryptococcosis in Africa
that have accompanying outcome data and are fully genome sequenced. We will investigate the thresholds for
activation of these pathways and the intensity and duration of responses across the isolates, assessing
temperature dependent changes in translational output and both cytoplasmic and mitochondrial intracellular
reactive oxygen species as ISR activators. We will also determine if the ISR regulon differs across the panel of
clinical isolates. This work will define pathways responsible for the agility of this important pathogen that differ
from non-pathogen environmental relatives and from the model yeast and identify additional targets for future
therapeutic interventions.

Approximately 8.2 million Americans suffer from chronic wounds. Chronic wounds can be difficult to treat, and if
left untreated, they can lead to serious infections, tissue damage, and even amputation. Besides, the cost of
managing chronic wounds is very high – which requires frequent visits to healthcare providers, specialized
wound care products, and in some cases, hospitalization. This can place a financial burden on both patients and
the healthcare system. Blood perfusion, or the flow of blood to the tissues, is a critical factor in the healing of
chronic wounds. Chronic wounds often result from poor blood flow to the affected area, which can lead to a lack
of oxygen and nutrients necessary for the healing process. The long-term objective of this project is to improve
wound care and impact wound treatment services by developing low-cost technologies that aid with chronic
wound treatment and care. The primary objective of this application is to design, implement and validate
mHealth-based blood perfusion assessment tools to empower individuals with chronic wounds in daily life.
Building on our prior work, in this project we will enhance and validate a smartphone-based multi-spectral
imaging sensor to obtain perfusion-related measures (Aim 1), conduct a clinical study to validate mHealth-based
biomarkers with machine learning algorithms (Aim 2), and rigorously assess the tools in usability and learnability
(Aim 3). The approach is innovative because it will explore and validate new mobile computing and data-driven
techniques for wound care and blood perfusion assessment based on evidence-based ground truth. It holds the
potential to advance the current standard of wound care for recovery after discharge from clinical therapies.
These contributions are significant because they can extend the health self-management of our society through
proactive health care and real-time intervention, and reduce the subjective bias and financial burden for patients,

There are now 8 FDA-approved antibody-drug-conjugates (ADCs) on the market. ADC technology is being widely
pursued for oncology, autoimmunity, ophthalmology, and infectious disease applications. In spite of tremendous
success, however, the ADC development process is riddled with challenges associated with ADC aggregation, linker-
stability concerns, unexpected toxicity, and poor pharmacokinetics. While it is impossible to lay the blame for this at
the feet of a single phenomenon, one common factor shared by the vast majority of ADCs is the reliance on a
hydrophobic peptide linker (i.e. ValCit-PABC) that is stable in plasma but rapidly cleaved by lysosomal cathepsins.
Various studies have recently shown that this linker is more unstable in circulation was than previously believed, being
susceptible to cleavage by both plasma esterases (Ces1C) and lymphocyte-associated proteases (neutrophil elastase).
It is now widely believed that cleavage by neutrophil elastase is responsible for the dose-limiting neutropenia and
thrombocytopenia so commonly seen for many ADCs. A new generation of cleavable linkers is urgently needed in order
to overcome these liabilities. Herein, we propose the optimization and evaluation of “redesigned” ADC linkers that
contain asparagine (Asn) motifs which are rapidly cleaved by asparaginyl endoprotease, also known as legumain. Our
team has identified several Asn-containing sequences that are rapidly cleaved by lysosomal legumain while retaining
stability in mouse and human plasma. Our preliminary data shows that ADCs that incorporate these linkers exhibit
comparable in vitro cytotoxicity to classical ValCit-PABC linkers – but are not susceptible to cleavable by Ces1C or
neutrophil elastase. We have designed three specific aims to optimize this linker and to demonstrate that model ADCs
that use these linkers have improved therapeutic potential as compared to traditional ValCit-PABC linkers. Aim #1 is
is focused on the optimization of the peptide linker itself. We will prepare a FRET-based library of Asn-containing
peptides in order to identify robust linkers that can be incorporated into various cancer-targeting ADCs. Aim #2 is
focused on the development of suitable self-immolative spacers for the legumain cleavable peptides. The spacer will
be optimized in order to facilitate rapid cleavage in the lysosome and high stability in plasma. Aim #3 will establish
the therapeutic utility of legumain-cleavable ADCs in a model of pancreatic cancer. Specifically, we will incorporate
our novel linkers into anti-GCC ADCs that are of interest for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. The ADCs will be
compared head-to-head with a traditional ADC (TAK-264) that failed phase 2 clinical trials due to dose limiting
neutropenia. We anticipate that our novel linkers will impart an improved tolerability to this ADC while maintaining the
efficacy. Accomplishment of these aims will firmly establish the suitability of legumain-cleavage for therapeutic
applications – and will poise the technology for clinical application. Development of novel pancreatic-cancer targeting
ADCs will pave the way towards clinical evaluation in an area of tremendous unmet medical need.

Antibody drug conjugate (ADC) immunogenicity is a growing concern due to the increased interest in immune-
stimulating drug delivery technology. A recent study by Novartis demonstrated that 14 out of 14 patients dosed
with an experimental immune-stimulatory ADC developed a measurable anti-drug antibody (ADA) response.
ADA negatively affects treatment by neutralizing drugs, increasing drug clearance, and causing severe allergic
reactions. There is an urgent need for an effective method of conjugating payload to antibodies while
minimizing the development and the effects of ADAs. We have developed an ADC bioconjugation technology
that employs the conserved Q295 residue (continued funding provided by NIH 1RO1GM140026-O1A1) that we
believe will mitigate many of these ADA concerns. The goal of this proposal is to demonstrate that this
technology reduces Fc-gamma uptake in antigen presenting cells (APCs) and masks the drugs from binding to
ADAs by hiding them in a sterically occluded hydrophobic pocket on the Fc domain. This goal will be achieved
through the two aims. Aim #1 focuses on developing NMR and fluorescence-based tools to demonstrate that
ADC payloads at the Q295 site are constrained within the sterically occluded IgG1 hydrophobic pocket. To this
end we propose conjugating model payloads to the Q295 site using various linkers (such as short alkyl,
peptide, and PEG) and determining their proximity to the hydrophobic pocket using two experimental methods:
1) a proximity induced fluorescent quenching assay using Oregon Green 488, due to its ability to self-quench
and 2) F-19 protein NMR using a trifluoromethyl probe, due to its high sensitivity and low background level in
biological samples. Aim #2 focuses on demonstrating that payloads attached to the sterically occluded Q295
position have reduced ADA binding and reduced potential for eliciting immunogenicity caused by Fc-gamma
mediated uptake of ADCs. Achievement of the aims outlined herein will result in an antibody conjugation
technology that exhibits a reduced risk of ADA and may be useful for the design of immune-stimulating
antibody conjugates.

Cocaine use disorder is a complexly determined, heritable trait that imposes significant harm on those afflicted
and on society. Discovery of the genetic factors that influence cocaine use disorder risk is imperative for a
comprehensive understanding of cocaine addiction neurobiology. In an ongoing study, we have characterized
a large panel of inbred mouse lines for voluntary cocaine self-administration (IVSA). We are utilizing this
approach to identify genes and allelic variants that influence cocaine self-administration, including Neuron-
navigator-1 (Nav1), which has emerged as a candidate gene from our genetic analyses. Furthermore, inbred
reference strains in the HMDP that are predisposed to take large amounts of cocaine represent polygenic
models of extreme cocaine use and can be used to understand how risk variants collectively impact
neurobiology to ultimately affect cocaine self-administration. The project proposed here will directly investigate
the polygenic and single gene impact of genetic risk for extreme cocaine IVSA on mesolimbic dopamine
neurotransmission, a key neurobiological function impacted by cocaine and other drugs of abuse. This project
will provide training in fast-scan cyclic voltammetry, optogenetics and fiber photometry and will allow me to
create a unique niche in addiction neurogenetics research. Aim 1 will investigate the influence of polygenic risk
for extreme cocaine IVSA on dopamine neurotransmission in the Nucleus Accumbens (NAc) shell after acute
application of cocaine. This aim may reveal genetic influences on basal and acute dopamine responses that
underlie risk for dysregulated cocaine use. Aim 2 will investigate the influence of polygenic risk for extreme
cocaine IVSA on neuroadaptations in dopamine transmission in the NAc following chronic cocaine IVSA
exposure. This aim may reveal genetically determined adaptations of dopamine transmission that underlie
escalated use after chronic exposure. Aim 3 will evaluate the causal effects of experimental changes in Nav1
expression on dopamine transmission at the single-gene level. This project will advance understanding of how
genetics intersect with neurobiology to affect cocaine use. The training I will receive in conducting this project
will broaden my skill set and allow me to more effectively investigate addiction neurogenetics.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Recent decades have dramatically changed our view of RNA. While RNA was initially believed to be barely
a passive messenger in the transfer of genetic information from DNA to proteins, it is now clear that RNA is
an exciting and underexplored regulatory molecule that will continue to deliver new discoveries in biology
and medicine. Our research program strives to capitalize on these exciting future discoveries by exploring
chemical modifications to modulate the structure and function regulatory RNAs. The long-term goals are to
1) develop novel RNA chemical modifications for fundamental studies and biomedical applications, and 2)
explore new modes of sequence-specific recognition of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). Our research
program comprises two distinct but interrelated projects: 1) novel backbone modifications to improve
specificity of regulatory RNAs, and 2) triplex-forming peptide nucleic acids (PNAs) to modulate structure and
biological activity regulatory RNAs. Project 1 replaces internucleotide phosphates with amides and other
non-native linkages in short interfering RNAs and RNAs associated with clustered regularly interspaced
short palindromic repeats (CRISPR). The goals are to optimize the activity and sequence specificity of these
RNAs. The premise is that backbone modifications will remodel and improve RNA-protein interactions and,
hence, modulate the activity and specificity. Project 2 explores chemically modified PNA as a ligand for
sequence-specific conformational and functional control of biomedically important dsRNA. The goals are to
develop PNAs that shift between alternative structures of complex RNAs and to improve the cellular uptake
of PNA. The premise is that nucleobase-modified triplex-forming PNAs are uniquely suited for sequence-
specific recognition of dsRNA and will enable recognition of biologically important non-coding dsRNA. New
future directions will focus on biological activity of PNAs, especially, in phase-separated membrane-less
organelles. The projects involve collaborations with structural biochemists (Martin Egli, Janez Plavec),
biological chemists (Naoki Sugimoto), and biotech companies (Korro Bio, Inc.). The two projects share a
common theme of designing chemical modifications that take advantage of charge complementarity
between the RNA target and the ligands and proteins interacting with RNA. The overreaching idea is to
develop RNA chemical modifications and RNA binding ligands that avoid unproductive electrostatic
repulsion and capitalize on productive electrostatic attraction while concurrently enhancing sequence
specificity of molecular interactions. This thrust grows out of our recent discoveries that RNA is unusually
receptive to chemical modifications that neutralize the negative charge of phosphate backbone, both in RNA
itself and in RNA binding oligonucleotide analogues. If successful, our research will contribute to addressing
key gaps in RNA interference, CRISPR, and PNA technologies for recognition of therapeutically relevant
RNAs, and will open doors for development of unique research tools and new therapeutic strategies.

We are pursuing the first anti-tumor small molecules that act specifically against human Sonic Hh protein
autoprocessing, a unique biosynthetic event that is necessary to drive oncogenic hedgehog (Hh) ligand
dependent cell/cell signaling. Sonic Hh protein autoprocessing involves a precursor form of Hh and is
responsible for liberating the mature Sonic Hh signaling ligand while also modifying the ligand’s terminal
carboxyl group with cholesterol. The long-standing challenge has been to discover small molecules that
specifically antagonize this key reaction within the tumor cell. To facilitate discovery, we have devised the
first in-cell assay system to screen for antagonists of human Hh autoprocessing at high throughput. Our
assay couples intracellular Sonic Hh autoprocessing to the extracellular secretion of a bioluminescent
reporter enzyme. We recently miniaturized this assay for 1536-well plates and in preliminary work,
completed a successful pilot screen against LOPAC. Here we propose a two-year high risk/gain strategy
that integrates: (AIM 1) In-cell quantitative high throughput screening in collaboration with the National
Center for Advancing Translational Science (NCATS) to discover the first bioactive drug-like antagonists
of human Sonic Hh autoprocessing; (AIM 2) Pre-clinical evaluation of the anti-tumor effects of those novel
Hh autoprocessing inhibitors toward human multiple myeloma and human colon cancer cells, which exhibit
Hh-ligand dependent growth. We hypothesize that specific antagonists of Sonic Hh autoprocessing will
deplete extracellular Sonic Hh ligand. Tumor apoptosis is the expected result of this ligand deprivation
strategy. In summary, using an innovative assay and novel anti-Hh approach, we are poised to address a
significant gap in the field of Hh signaling while pursuing a new class of cancer therapeutics.

Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a leading cause of disability worldwide and a critical public health problem.
Of particular concern are the high rates of MDD during adolescence, which have continued to increase in recent
years. Importantly, the emergence of depression during adolescence is associated with future major depressive
episodes in adulthood and risk for suicide. Theorists have proposed that the spike in rates of depression
observed during adolescence may be due, at least in part, to neurobiological and psychosocial changes that
occur during this period, including changes in reward processing. Importantly, aberrant neural reward processing
in adolescents is associated with current depressive symptoms and predicts the onset of future depressive
episodes. However, most of this research has focused on adolescents’ neural responses to monetary reward,
despite research showing that social rewards are especially salient for this age group. Further, a large majority
of this research is confined to laboratory settings and relatively little is known about how laboratory-based
measures of reward processing translate to real-world experiences of pleasure and affect. This proposed study
aims to address the limitations of extant research by examining event related potential (ERP) indices of social
and monetary reward processing in adolescents at heightened risk of developing MDD (maternal history of
MDD). After completing the laboratory-based reward tasks, adolescents will complete 7 days of ecological
momentary assessment (EMA) surveys to assess real-world levels of pleasure and affect in their daily lives.
Specific Aim 1 is to determine whether laboratory-based measures of reward outcome processing predict real-
world levels of consummatory pleasure and affect among adolescents at risk for MDD. Specific Aim 2 is to
evaluate whether monetary or social reward processing is a stronger predictor of real-world reports of pleasure
and daily affect. In addressing these aims, I also seek to address another limitation of existing research.
Specifically, the overwhelming majority of ERP reward processing research focuses on the reward positivity
(RewP), which only indexes one subcomponent of reward outcome processing even though other substages
can be reliably assessed with ERPs (e.g., feedback-P3 and feedback-LPP). Therefore, although primary
analyses will focus on the RewP to be consistent with prior research, exploratory analyses will examine whether
the predictive validity of the feedback-P3 and feedback-LPP. These research aims are complemented by a series
of training goals designed to facilitate the applicant’s development into an independent researcher. These
training goals are to (i) gain expertise in collecting and processing EEG/ERP data using reward paradigms, (ii)
develop specialized skills in designing, collecting, and processing reward-relevant EMA data in adolescents, and
(iii) strengthening the applicant’s knowledge of intensive longitudinal data analysis. This project has the potential
to make significant contributions to the literature on biomarkers of depression risk and will provide the training
necessary for the applicant to become an independent researcher focused on risk for depression in adolescents.

naturally occurring modifications.
ABSTRACT:
 Solid phase synthesis of RNA is an important genomic tool, which offers precise control over the
oligonucleotide sequence and offers an opportunity for site-specific incorporation of RNA modifications,
fluorescent labels and biochemical tags. Discoveries of the twenty-first century created a strong need for a robust
synthesis of RNA strands, that are 100-200 nucleotides (-nt) in length. A major limitation of otherwise highly
optimized process is purification, which is notoriously difficult, labor intensive and requires expensive HPLC
instrumentation. As the result, solid phase synthesis of long oligonucleotides containing RNA modifications is
rarely attempted. This technology-development proposal aims to address this limitation by developing a non-
chromatographic RNA purification method which will be 10-times faster and 2-orders of magnitude cheaper and
will allow isolation of strands that are 100-200-nt long in good yield and 98% purity.
 The proposed purification strategy is based on bio-orthogonal inverse electron demand Diels-Alder (IEDDA)
chemistry between trans-cyclooctene (TCO) and tetrazine (Tz) that allows to selectively tag and purify
structurally complex and increasing long RNA strands from the failure strands that accrue during solid phase
synthesis. TCO and Tz are highly selective for each other and have minimal cross-reactivity with other functional
groups found in RNA. The bio-orthogonal click chemistry is highly efficient, even at very low concentrations of
TCO and Tz. During preliminary studies we have shown that our strategy allows efficient synthesis and
purification of 76-nt long tRNA and 101-nt long sgRNA with yields that were 10-times higher than conventional
purification methods.
 During the proposed research program, we aim to improve a number of important elements of our design to
bring the overall process to under 7 hrs, further improve the overall yield and purity of the isolated RNA. In Aim
1, we propose to expedite the process by developing a new photolabile linker that will allow fast photocleavage
using visible light. To improve purity and yield of isolated RNA, we propose to optimize the solid phase synthesis
procedure to ensure that all failure sequences are fully capped during each synthetic cycle. The optimized
process will be applied to increasingly longer RNA strands, from 76-nt tRNA to 188-nt long U2 snRNA. In Aim 2,
we plan to illustrate the power of our technology by synthesizing a 144-nt long artificial mRNA, containing m1A
and m6A modifications near the start codon. This will be the longest reported oligonucleotide containing RNA
modifications. The artificial mRNA will be utilized to investigate the impact of RNA modifications on the rate of in
vitro translation. We plan to work with NHGRI technology development team to make the proposed technology
widely available to researchers.

This proposal focuses on the divergent effects of the two major dietary forms of vitamin K on breast cancer. K
vitamins act as cofactors for gamma-glutamyl carboxylase (GGCX), which post-translationally introduces γ-
carboxyglutamate residues into proteins. Although most of the 17 known γ-carboxylated proteins function in
coagulation and bone homeostasis, the presence of GGCX in most tissues (including mammary gland) suggests
more extensive physiological roles for vitamin K. We have demonstrated that triple negative breast cancer
(TNBC) cell lines express GGCX and produce γ-carboxylated proteins in response to vitamin K1 (phylloquinone),
the major dietary form. In TNBC cells, K1 treatment enriches for the stem cell marker aldehyde dehydrogenase
1 (ALDH1) and promotes mammosphere formation. These data suggest that K1 sustains GGXC mediated γ-
carboxylation to drive aggressive breast cancer phenotypes. Through analysis of genomic cancer datasets, we
find that ~25% of breast tumors express GGCX and the vitamin K oxidoreductase (VKOR) genes required for its
activity. Patients with such tumors have poorer survival than those whose tumors do not express these genes at
high levels. Patients with this subtype of tumor would be candidates for therapies that limit K1 availability and/or
inhibit GGCX. Surprisingly, we found that vitamin K2 (menaquinone-4), another naturally occurring form present
in diet, does not stimulate γ-carboxylation or stem cell phenotypes in TNBC cells, but instead strongly suppresses
cell growth, migration and energy metabolism. These provocative data indicate that K1 and K2 exert distinct
effects on breast cancer cells, with K1 promoting and K2 suppressing aggressive phenotypes. We also found
that expression of the vitamin K2 biosynthesis enzyme UbiA Prenyltransferase Domain Containing 1 (UBIAD1)
is undetectable in TNBC, suggesting altered cellular handling of vitamin K. In Aim 1 we will dissect the effects
of K1 and K2 in vitro, evaluate the role of UBIAD1 and conduct feeding studies to measure accumulation of K1
and K2 in TNBC xenografts and host mammary gland in relation to tumor growth. In Aim 2 we will determine
whether deletion of GGCX from TNBC cells impacts γ-carboxylated protein synthesis and aggressive
phenotypes in vitro and in vivo. Aim 3 will identify relevant γ-carboxylated GGCX substrate proteins that mediate
the effects of K1. We anticipate that growth of tumors with high GGCX activity and low UBIAD1 will be stimulated
by high dietary K1 and inhibited by high dietary K2. These findings would identify GGCX as an oncogene and
the vitamin K pathway as a therapeutic target in a subset of patients with advanced breast cancer.

CAG repeat expansion diseases are the most common class of microsatellite expansion disorders. While
canonical translation of the CAG repeat leads to the production of polyglutamine proteins, these expansions can
also undergo non-canonical repeat associated non-AUG (RAN) translation. In the later process, translation is
initiated across multiple reading frames in the absence of AUG- or AUG-like start codons. While a few factors
that influence either canonical translation across microsatellite expansions or RAN translation have been
identified, our understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms responsible for translation in multiple
reading frames is extremely limited. Despite evidence that RNA structure plays a key role in RAN translation our
knowledge of the structural features that facilitate RAN translation is extremely limited. To examine the role of
RNA structure in non-canonical translation, I used a structure-forward approach to screen for multi-frame
translation, through which I identified several long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) that support translation in
multiple reading frames in the absence of both microsatellite repeat expansions and AUG-start codons. This
data suggests multiple avenues for RNA transcripts to support multi-frame translation, which has important
implications in biology, disease, and therapeutics. The overarching goal of this proposal is to determine the RNA
structures, protein networks and therapeutically relevant modifiers that govern various forms of multi-frame
translation (MFT). To determine the proportion of the human genome capable of undergoing MFT, I will utilize a
novel MFT reporter system to perform a genome-wide screen. Utilising candidate MFT sequences and CAG
repeat expansions along with my already identified MFT lncRNAs, I will determine the cellular RNA structures
and protein factors that facilitate non-canonical multi-frame translation. I will also employ a first-of-its-kind
strategy to identify novel, therapeutically relevant modifiers of co-occurring canonical and non-canonical
translation in multiple reading frames. These studies will enable a better understanding of the mechanism of
multi-frame translation and identify therapeutic strategies that have the potential to provide therapeutic efficacy
across multiple CAG repeat expansion diseases and be applicable to a wider range of neurological diseases.
Together this research provides an innovative approach to understand a novel paradigm for translation diversity
and will enable a better understanding of disease pathogenesis in repeat expansion diseases as well as
elucidating the aspects of MFT most suitable to therapeutic intervention.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：With an ever-aging population and an estimated prevalence of Alzheimer disease of 5.7 million people
in the United States alone, the impetus for more targeted treatments for age-related cognitive disorders is greater
now than ever. Neuroplasticity, the ability of neural networks to adapt and remodel given experience, dwindles
with age, providing possible mechanistic insights into this decline. An important layer of neuroplasticity, unique
to a couple of discrete areas of the adult mammalian brain, is the addition of newly-generated neurons into
existing circuits, a process known as neurogenesis. While the existence and importance of adult hippocampal
neurogenesis in young adults has been well-established, we know very little about hippocampal neurogenesis
in aging brains. Importantly, hippocampal neurogenesis continues into old age although there is a substantial
decline in the number of newborn neurons. For example, in 26-month-old rodents, ~1000 proliferating cells could
be detected per day, although only half that detected in 5-month-old adult rats. A recent study demonstrated that
thousands of new neurons could be detected in the aged adult human dentate gyrus, and further, that in patients
with Alzheimer disease, newborn neurons were fewer in number and exhibited delayed maturation. As a starting
point, we ask why neurogenesis declines in the aging brain. Based on our preliminary studies, we found that
biased circuit activity may regulate hippocampal neurogenesis in the aging brain. During screening of potential
molecules biasing circuit activity, we found that one sphingolipid signaling is active in interneurons and becomes
less active in the aging brain. We propose to genetically intervene this signaling to study its role in regulating
neurogenesis in the aging brain. Lastly, we determine how biased circuit activity regulates hippocampal
neurogenesis. Our results will not only provide mechanistic insights into the understanding of neurogenesis in
the aging brain it also provides a possible strategy to intervene aging circuit activity to regulate neurogenesis.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Project Summary: While mechanical thrombectomy has advanced the treatment of large vessel occlusion
(LVO) stroke, over 50% of patients still suffer from significant disability or death. Ischemia/reperfusion injury
(I/RI), the result of restoring blood flow to deeply ischemic tissue, accelerates recruitment of polymorphonuclear
neutrophils (PMNs). PMNs exert poor outcomes in two ways. First, PMNs physically obstruct
cerebral microvessels in the stroke bed despite macrovascular reperfusion – a condition known as microvascular
‘no-reflow’. Second, PMNs exert toxic effects regionally once recruited at postcapillary venules and extravasated
into the infarcted brain. Accordingly, preclinical studies that block PMN recruitment have had success in reducing
stroke burden and improving neurologic outcome. Unfortunately, these preclinical studies have not been
successful in human trials. These translational roadblocks may be addressed by investigating the spatiotemporal
determinants of PMN recruitment as it relates to the in vivo cerebrovasculature during stroke. Using a mouse
stroke model to simulate the LVO population and novel histopathological and imaging techniques, my preliminary
data have found that PMN recruitment throughout I/RI is non-uniform up to 72 hours after infarction. PMNs were
also found to progress cortically to subcortically throughout I/RI over the course of 72 hours, with partial restriction
to the cortical surface by administration of an antibody that blocks transendothelial migration (TEM). These
results support the concept of stroke microenvironments – highly regionalized areas within an infarct where
inflammation and impaired microcirculation interface with each other. I hypothesize that these stroke
microenvironments within an infarct are due to feedback loops between 1) microvascular flow and oxygenation;
and 2) PMN recruitment. To test this hypothesis, I will investigate two aims: 1) Defining and physiologically
manipulating the stroke microenvironment 2) Determine how PMN infiltration and position regulates I/RI over
time. I will test these aims using techniques of multimodal in vivo animal imaging, advanced microscopy, and
targeted manipulation of both leukocyte biology and stroke physiology. These studies will ultimately be used to
identify molecular similarities of PMNs in particularly toxic stroke microenvironments, facilitating the investigation
and creation of novel leukocyte-based therapies. To complete these long-term goals, I will incorporate a
multidisciplinary mentorship team and short-term goals of developing expertise in live-animal imaging, advanced
microscopy, and leukocyte biology. With this K08 proposal, I will build a unique translational stroke program that
defines the interplay of stroke physiology and pathology to develop more precise and translatable therapies for
stroke patients.

for RMS consists of intensive multi-agent chemotherapy and has not significantly changed in nearly five decades. These
compounds target general vulnerabilities of rapidly dividing cells and are not specific to the pathophysiology of RMS. As
such, treatment is accompanied by a suite of toxicities with potentially lifelong repercussions in pediatric patients.
Approximately 20% of RMS patients present with metastatic disease at diagnosis, and the failure-free survival rate for
these patients is only 30% after five years. Hence, there is a pressing need for specific yet potent therapies for RMS.
 High-throughput, negative-selection genetic screens across cell lines of varying tumor types have the potential to
reveal growth dependencies specific to a given cancer. Our results from these functional genomics experiments identified
myogenic differentiation 1 (MYOD) as the most potent growth dependency factor specific to RMS. MYOD is a member
of the basic Helix-Loop-Helix family of transcription factors and is a master regulator of muscle differentiation. MYOD is
one of the predominant myogenic markers used in the clinical diagnosis of RMS but has long been thought to be
functionally inactive in RMS, as this cancer does not complete the myogenic differentiation program. However, in light of
our genetic screening data, we hypothesize that RMS exploits the transcriptional activity of MYOD to drive growth of the
tumor. The proposed research aims to determine the molecular mechanisms by which MYOD regulates growth of RMS.
The outlined experiments will identify features of MYOD necessary for sustaining RMS growth (Aim 1), uncover the
genetic targets of MYOD that mediate growth (Aim 2), and evaluate the functional significance of MYOD targets (Aim
3). Data from these experiments will provide insight into the molecular pathophysiology of RMS and may reveal critical
nodes in this program that warrant therapeutic investigation.
 The requisite skills and knowledge to carry out this research proposal will be supported by the integrated basic
and medical science education in the Medical Scientist Training Program at Stony Brook University (SBU). The
mentorship and environments at SBU and Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory will provide all of the necessary resources for a
tailored training program to effectively develop the applicant into an independent experimentalist, analyst, and
communicator of cancer research.

Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) results from mutations in the DMD gene, which generates the protein
dystrophin. Although the gene produces various sized isoforms, only the largest isoform, Dp427, performs a
critical function in skeletal muscle by linking the extracellular matrix (ECM) to the cytoskeleton. DMD mutations
can also cause neurological dysfunction, but the cell and molecular basis of these changes are poorly under-
stood. Interestingly, the severity of cognitive deficits seen in DMD worsens with successive loss of the smaller
isoforms that cannot connect the ECM and cytoskeleton, implying additional functions these shorter dystrophins.
DMD patients have reduced total brain and gray matter volume, with mutations that affect transcription of the
mid-size isoform Dp140 being most strongly linked to this reduction16. I propose here to explore the role of dys-
trophin in the developing ventricular/subventricular zone (V-SVZ), the major neural stem cell niche (NSC) in the
adult mammalian brain. A key output of the V-SVZ during postnatal brain development is oligodendrocyte pro-
genitor cells (OPCs), which go on to myelinate the forebrain. The timing and proper execution of myelination
plays a critical role in many of the same neurological processes that are affected in DMD. Ependymal cells (ECs)
are specialized multi-ciliated cells in the V-SVZ that line the ventricles of the brain that surround NSCs and
regulate NSC quiescence and activation. My sponsor’s lab recently reported that dystroglycan, the binding part-
ner of dystrophin, modulates notch signaling in V-SVZ NSCs to regulate both NSC fate decisions and the devel-
opment of ECs24. Dystroglycan and dystrophin were also both found to influence postnatal OPC development,
including delaying white matter tract myelination. Dysregulated notch signaling has been reported in muscle
stem cells in animal models of DMD41, however, whether dystrophin regulates notch in NSCs remains unknown.
In my first aim, I will investigate how dystrophin isoforms regulate early postnatal V-SVZ niche formation by
examining EC development and organization into pinwheels. In the second aim, I will explore how dystrophin
isoforms regulate V-SVZ NSC function and the production of neuronal and glial progenitors. Throughout I will
examine dystrophin’s ability to regulate notch signaling in V-SVZ NSCs and test whether dystrophin-deficient
cell phenotypes can be rescued by modulating the notch pathway. I will use small dystrophin constructs and
DMD mouse models (mdx, mdx4cv, mdx3cv) in combination with notch activity reporter mice. Intriguingly, small
dystrophins have been reported to translocate to the nucleus in muscle cells, indicating the potential for novel
functional roles for small dystrophins in the nucleus of NSCs, which will be assessed by modification of se-
quences needed for nuclear import/export. Lastly, as a complementary approach, I will use neonatal ventricle
electroporation strategies to prevent or rescue dystrophin expression in the developing V-SVZ and use V-SVZ
cell cultures that model NSC and EC development. Together, my studies will investigate dystrophin’s role in the
formation and function of a crucial stem cell niche that generates neural progenitors for the postnatal brain.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
The development of small molecule inhibitors has revolutionized targeted therapeutics, especially in the field of
protein kinases. However, pharmaceutical development continues to be plagued by two problems: (i) designing
specific drugs with limited off-target toxicity and (ii) combating the occurrence of resistance mutations in the
target of interest. The role of binding kinetics, referring to a ligand’s association and dissociation rate to its target,
are underexplored and underexploited in addressing these issues. In the non-equilibrium environment of the
human body, drug on- and off-rates have proven to be superior optimization parameters for candidate
compounds than the traditional IC50 and KD metrics. Furthermore, mutations that reduce drug residence time,
defined as how long a drug stays bound to its target, can presumably confer resistance to therapy.
Imatinib, the seminal achievement of rational drug design, inhibits the BCR-Abl oncoprotein and has reduced
the mortality rate for chronic myelogenous leukemia by 80%. Imatinib’s specificity for Abl kinase is due to its
conformational selectivity, and its success has sparked intense efforts to discover specific inhibitors of kinases
dysregulated in cancer and inflammatory disease. Despite its clinical success, relapse to imatinib therapy due to
resistance mutations is common, and a fundamental understanding of how mutations distant from the ligand
binding site cause resistance continues to elude us. We have preliminarily identified a series of patient-derived
resistance mutations that paradoxically show no change in equilibrium affinity for imatinib. We have also
validated that the Abl N368S mutant causes imatinib resistance by increasing drug dissociation rate. Therefore,
I propose using these Abl kinase mutations as a model system to explore how binding kinetics affect ligand
specificity, potency, and efficacy. My central hypothesis is that altered inhibitor binding or dissociation
kinetics could cause resistance independent of inhibitor affinity. I will explore this hypothesis by measuring
the effects of Abl kinase mutations on drug residence time and efficacy and by defining the conformational
changes of the Abl N368S substitution.
Through these studies, I will determine the structural mechanism of “kinetic resistance” mutations, a novel type
of drug resistance which I believe extends throughout the kinome. I will also elucidate key structural factors in
the conformational exchange of Abl kinase and the imatinib unbinding process. In addition, I will provide insight
into how prolonging in vivo drug action through slow dissociation rates can be applied to develop drugs with
minimal off-target toxicity. The contributions from this proposal are significant because they will validate altered
binding kinetics as both a novel mechanism of drug resistance in a highly-therapeutically relevant protein family
and as a viable strategy to improve drug specificity.

 Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) maintains its status as one of most lethal solid cancers with
a 5-year survival of 8%. Minor improvements have been attributed to early detection, but the vast majority of
patients face a grim prognosis without effective therapeutic intervention. Molecular analysis of patient samples
has often been confounded by mixed biological samples, leading to reproducibility challenges. Previously, our
lab performed virtual microdissection on bulk RNA-seq patient samples establishing robust prognostic gene
signatures describing an aggressive basal-like and drug-responsive classical tumor subtypes highlighting the
importance of cancer heterogeneity across patients. Using these signatures as patient classifiers has been an
important utility in preliminary clinical trials and therapeutic profiling of patient derived organoids.
 Building evidence suggests patient unique TME composition impacts PDAC progression and resistance
to standard treatments. While patient tissue characterization with bulk measurements has provided key insights
into cancer biology, parsing the complex tumor microenvironments requires higher resolution due to the
widespread stromal involvement and sparse neoplastic populations. Single-cell sequencing delivers the
analytical power to help identify variable TME elements between patients that lead to the distinct prognostic and
therapeutic responses. Thus, understanding the extent and role of TME heterogeneity in PDAC across patient
tumor subtypes is paramount to widen the door for personalized medicine in oncology.
 In this proposal, I will establish a comprehensive single-cell atlas of human PDAC TME to significantly
lower the barrier between researchers and complex single-cell transcriptomics data to explore novel prognostic
and synergistic therapeutic targets. I will use local and public single cell RNA-seq data of PDAC tissue to
investigate the extent and role of cellular heterogeneity across patient tumor subtypes. Specifically, I will define
molecular signatures and map out the interactome of functional cell types within stromal, lymphocytic, myeloid
populations at unprecedented spatial resolution. Ultimately, by integrating high-dimensional data from single-cell
RNA-seq and Spatial Transcriptomics, this work will shed light on the intricate tissue pathology while laying down
a broad framework for understanding multi-axis cell interactions behind progression and resistance in diverse
cancer types.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Project Summary / Abstract
 Over two decades of research has focused on elucidating the pathophysiology of working memory (WM)
deficits in patients with schizophrenia in the hopes of finding effective treatments, as these deficits are more
closely linked to functional outcomes in patients than are psychotic symptoms, and they are presumed to arise
from alterations in dopaminergic function that may be fundamental to the pathogenesis of schizophrenia.
However, the overwhelming majority of research in this area has treated WM as a unitary cognitive ability that
is assayed equally well by any of the wide range of tasks commonly employed in functional Magnetic Resonance
Imaging (fMRI) studies of patients with schizophrenia. In contrast, empirical evidence suggests that at least
three distinct cognitive abilities contribute to performance on WM tasks: attentional control, short-term
memory capacity, and long-term (or secondary) memory retrieval. These are presumed to have dissociable
neural substrates and may be differentially impaired in different patients, which would serve to obscure
potential biomarkers of WM deficit in case-control fMRI studies of patients. The NIMH Research Domain
Criteria (RDoC) Matrix attempts to capture some of this complexity by defining four subconstructs of WM
(active maintenance, flexible updating, limited capacity, and interference controls), although these differ from
those based on empirical work described above, and no empirical work to date has attempted to determine the
extent to which various WM tasks tap these four putative subconstructs. The overarching goal of this
application is to conduct a large-scale latent-variable analysis of the most commonly employed WM tasks in the
fMRI literature of schizophrenia, along with a broad array of other cognitive tasks, in order to clarify the
underlying cognitive abilities (or subconstructs) that subserve WM task performance and to identify neural
correlates of these empirically identified subconstructs. To this end, 500 participants will undergo behavioral
testing on 9 WM and 12 other cognitive tasks in order to provide a robust dataset for latent variable analysis
using factor analytic and structural equation modeling techniques that will identify the subconstructs that
underlie performance on each of the WM tasks. Next, 80 patients with schizophrenia and 80 matched control
participants will undergo the same battery of tasks, but will perform 7 of the WM tasks during fMRI scanning,
in order to identify neural correlates of the subconstructs that are specifically disrupted in schizophrenia. This
work will help to advance our understanding of WM deficits in schizophrenia and will identify specific neural
targets, and the optimal tasks that future investigators can employ to target them, that are disrupted in
schizophrenia. These neural targets can then form the basis for establishing target engagement in clinical trials
aimed at finding treatments for cognitive deficits in schizophrenia.

 Schizophrenia is among the most severe and burdensome medical conditions worldwide, yet the brain alterations
that lead to the symptoms of schizophrenia remain unknown. This K23 application presents a research and training
program that will support the applicant on a path towards becoming an NIH-funded independent investigator focused
on understanding the neurobiology of schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders. The activities in this application
build on the candidate’s prior training and are set in a resource-rich environment that will foster her development of
expertise in 1) application of MRS and advanced MRI neuroimaging methodologies; 2) physician-scientist approaches to
studying pathophysiology in patients with schizophrenia; 3) neurocircuitry and systems neuroscience perspectives on
hippocampus pathology in psychotic disorders; and 4) responsible conduct of research. The overarching goal of the
research to be carried out in this application is to take findings from animal models of schizophrenia, which were
motivated by original research in patients with the disorder, back to the clinical setting in order to determine whether
the brain circuit alterations observed in the animal models are observable in human patients. Specifically, findings in the
prenatal methylazoxymethanol acetate (MAM) rodent model, which was developed to model the alterations in
dopamine function seen in patients with schizophrenia, suggest hyperactivity of the ventral (anterior) hippocampus may
increase its glutamatergic output to the ventral striatum and lead, via ventral pallidal and other GABAergic projections to
the ventral midbrain, to disinhibited firing of dopamine neurons. In addition, a convergence of several post mortem and
in vivo imaging findings in patients suggests that abnormal GABAergic activity in the hippocampus may further
compound hippocampal glutamatergic overdrive. This project will directly test the relationships among these
neurochemical alterations in individual medication-free patients with schizophrenia using sophisticated magnetic
resonance imaging methods. If this non-invasive, multimodal imaging paradigm provides evidence to relate hippocampal
GABA and glutamate abnormalities to dopamine system dysfunction in patients with schizophrenia, it would have
important implications for the understanding of the brain bases of schizophrenia, and would generate a novel
multimodal imaging paradigm for testing new molecular, anatomical, and circuit-modulating targets for treatment of
this devastating illness.

Rickettsia is a genus of arthropod-borne pathogens responsible for typhus and spotted fever diseases. Hallmark
of Rickettsia is their reductive genome evolution, obligate intracellular lifecycle within vascular endothelial cells,
immune escape in the bloodstream, and transmission via blood-feeding arthropods, with Rickettsia replicating
in the gastrointestinal tract or salivary glands of their various vectors (e.g., lice, ticks, mites, or fleas). Recent
environmental and sociological changes have supported the invasion and expansion of arthropod vectors into
new geographical areas, prompting healthcare alerts for the increasing arthropod-borne rickettsial infections.
Owing to the technical difficulties of isolating, propagating, and genetically manipulating Rickettsia, early work
studied rickettsial virulence mechanisms by expressing target genes in heterologous organisms (such as
Escherichia coli) or characterizing rickettsial variants with different genetic backgrounds. While these studies
identified putative virulence genes, they failed to address the biological functions involved in rickettsial
pathogenesis, transmission, and host immunity against typhus and spotted fever diseases. To explore the
genetic bases of rickettsial pathogenesis, recent studies developed genetic tools for Rickettsia and characterized
rickettsial variants. These investigations characterized several Rickettsia mutants with defects in actin-based
motility, O-antigen synthesis, and cell-to-cell spread. Nevertheless, genes underpinning rickettsial entry into
vascular endothelial cells, intracellular immune evasion and replication, release and survival in the bloodstream,
or replication in various cell types of their arthropod vectors remain largely uncharacterized. This application
describes an in vitro transposition reaction using purified Tn5-transposase complexed with the kkaebi mini-
transposon, which provides for chloramphenicol selection of Rickettsia variants with single chromosomal
insertions. DNA sequencing of insertion sites demonstrates the random nature of insertional mutagenesis with
the kkaebi-transposon, while chloramphenicol-selection allows for facile isolation of variants that can be analyzed
for in vitro replication as well as defects in the pathogenesis and transmission. In the first phase (R61) of this
application, kkaebi variants will be generated using two model organisms of pathogenic Rickettsia (R. conorii
from the spotted fever group and R. typhi from the typhus group). After the successful completion of the first
phase, kkaebi variants will be characterized for phenotypic alterations using biochemical and molecular
analyses, tissue culture infections, tick infection models, and mouse infection studies. Overall, this work will
generate key experimental resources for the research community to comprehensively identify rickettsial genes
essential for pathogenesis and transmission by arthropod vectors.

For monoclonal antibody(mAb)-based radiopharmaceuticals to widely impact precision nuclear medicine,
strategies that both improve the convenience and reduce the radiation burden to non-target organs are urgently
needed. Compared to direct-labeling strategies, pretargeting makes mAb-based nuclear imaging and targeted
radionuclide therapy (TRT) safer, but it has yet to realize its potential impact on clinical precision nuclear
medicine. However, the modest successes and inherent limitations of existing pretargeting platforms have
defined that a successful platform needs: 1) to be nonimmunogenic, 2) designed to be modular and tunable to
any mAb and radionuclide, and 3) to avoid clearing agents. To date, no platform has met these criteria, and there
remains a critical need for pretargeting strategies to improve precision nuclear medicine.
The long-term goal of this proposal is to develop a host:guest pretargeting platform that utilizes curcubit[7]uril
(CB7) “hosts” and adamantane (Adma) radioligand “guests” for nuclear imaging and TRT with elementally-
matched 203Pb (imaging) and 212Pb (therapy). CB7-Adma host:guest pretargeting is based on nonimmunogenic
molecules, uses a modular approach, and can achieve high uptake in target tissues using mAb targeting vectors
with lag times that nullify the need for clearing agents. Thus, it is hypothesized that this platform will address the
shortcomings of other platforms yielding a translatable radiotheranostic approach to cancer treatment.
Specific Aim 1 of this proposal is the “Development and evaluation of 203/212Pb-labeled radioligands for
pretargeting.” To achieve this goal, a library of radioligands will be synthesized and evaluated in vitro as well as
in vivo, optimizing the parameters of the host:guest pretargeting approach and comparing the dosimetry to a
direct-labeling strategy in order to demonstrate the platform’s suitability for clinical translation
Specific Aim 2 is the “Evaluation of 212Pb pretargeted alpha-TRT in murine xenograft models.” Using the
strategies for pretargeting developed in Specific Aim 1 as well as a fractionated dosing approach, we will
establish the efficacy of our host:guest pretargeting for alpha-TRT. We will also compare the dosimetry,
therapeutic index, therapeutic efficacy, and radiological toxicity to analogous approaches with directly-labeled
mAbs in a mouse model of cancer to validate the advantages.
Successfully achieving the aims of the proposed studies will lead to the development and validation of a next
generation pretargeting platform that is suitable for future translational studies and demonstrate its potential as
an innovative theranostic application for TRT. The platform will be a robust, safe, and convenient alternative to
direct-labeling strategies for mAbs that is widely applicable to precision nuclear medicine in human disease.

Title: Advanced Single-Cell Protein Analysis with Multiplex in Situ Tagging Array Technology
Single-cell analysis has been the essential approach in understanding cellular machinery, organism development,
and disease mechanisms. Proteins are naturally one of the main targets in single-cell analysis since proteins are
responsible for nearly every task for the cellular life. Unfortunately, proteins are not amplifiable like DNA, and
thus the minuscule amount of proteins on single cells poses a great challenge to the detection techniques. To
date, there is still no single-cell proteome technology available yet that has sufficient sensitivity and scale. We
have innovated a few single-cell protein detection techniques on an ultrahigh-density multiplex in situ tagging
(MIST) array which demonstrates its power for not only analyzing the full spectrum of function proteome in animal
and human cells, but also rapidly detecting cluster of surface proteins on smaller microbial pathogens. The MIST
array is a large-scale monolayer of small-size microbeads with a density much higher than most genome chips,
and the microbeads carry various probes for protein detection. The single-cell MIST (scMIST) technology has
exhibited it ability to quantify in single cells up to 465 functional proteins, which is the highest multiplexity assay
and the most comprehensive mapping of T cell protein markers. The smaller scale of the assay proved its utility
in prediction of sepsis outcomes by analyzing large quantity of primary samples. In the proposed research, we
will extend scMIST to spatially analyze solid tissue specimens by quantifying ~500 functional proteins to
thoroughly assess cellular features, physiological status and functions within a tissue microenvironment. In
addition, we will optimize the scMIST and combine it with artificial intelligence algorithms to precisely prognose
disease occurrence and progression. Last, an explosion-like biomolecular chain reaction will be developed on
the MIST array to rapidly detect few protein copies on single bacteria or viral particles by specifically amplifying
signals for millions to billions of times, with the goal of visually detecting single pathogens within a minute. The
implementation of these advanced single-cell protein detection technologies will catalyze the revolution of
biomedical sciences and fundamentally enhance the precision of disease prognosis. Visual detection of single
pathogens within a minute will bring enormous opportunities in broadly many areas concerned with pathogens.

 The search for more effective treatment and prevention of tuberculosis has motivated the identification
genes that are essential for the growth and survival of the causative agent, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb).
These genes are potential new targets for developing and attenuated live vaccines. For example, targeting
metabolite biosynthesis can prevent Mtb from making essential building blocks and generate auxotrophs that
induce protective immunity, but do not cause disease. Riboflavin (vitamin B2) biosynthesis has been proposed
as a drug target because putative biosynthetic genes have been shown as essential in multiple transposon
screens, but Mtb is assumed to be unattainable as a riboflavin auxotroph and depend entirely on de novo
synthesis in vivo because it lacks a homologue for a known bacterial riboflavin transporter. However, our
critical review of the literature along with our preliminary data on inducible knockdown strains for riboflavin
biosynthesis genes provide an opportunity to test our central hypothesis that Mtb takes up riboflavin via a
noncanonical transport mechanism. We will test this hypothesis by identifying metabolites and genes that
support Mtb growth when riboflavin biosynthesis is disrupted and determining whether riboflavin metabolites
are limiting for Mtb growth in the host. If our hypotheses are correct, we expect to identify novel aspects of Mtb
metabolite uptake and utilization and determine the feasibility of target riboflavin biosynthesis as drug targets in
vivo, with potential impcats for the study of metabolite transporters in other intracellular pathogens.

Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is a very common, monogenetic kidney
disorder, affecting approximately 300,000 Americans1, 2. ADPKD primarily results from mutations
in PKD1 and PKD23. The pathophysiology of ADPKD is incompletely understood and treatment
options are limited. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNA) – defined by a length >200 nucleotides and
absence of a long open reading frame – are a class of non-protein-coding RNAs implicated in a
range of disease4, 5. They have emerged as an exciting new drug target category for many
common conditions6. However, the role of lncRNAs in ADPKD has been understudied. In a recent
study, we found that the lncRNA Pvt1 is highly upregulated in mouse and humans with ADPKD7.
Pvt1 is a known oncogenic lncRNA that is overexpressed in many cancers and regulates Myc,
other transcription factors, and multiple miRNAs, some of which have major functions in ADPKD8-
11. The role of Pvt1 in ADPKD is not known. We developed a Pkd1-mutant mouse metanephric
organ culture (MOC) as a cost-effective model to manipulate gene expression and identify targets
that modulate cystogenesis7. We discovered that self-complementary adeno-associated virus
(scAAV), serotype DJ, is highly effective in transducing epithelial cells of the mouse MOC. We
used scAAV/DJ shRNA to knockdown Pvt1 in Pkd1-null MOCs. We noted that knockdown of Pvt1
markedly reduced cyst index and downregulated c-MYC protein levels in Pkd1-null kidneys.
Based on these promising findings, we propose the following aims: 1) test whether ablation of
Pvt1 ameliorates cystogenesis in mouse ADPKD, and 2) determine the contribution of PVT1 in
human ADPKD by silencing PVT1 in kidney organoids derived from PKD1-mutant hESCs. If
successful, results from this study will confirm pathogenic upregulation of PVT1 in-vivo ADPKD,
which will form the basis of R01 application.

Chronic pain is widespread in the adult population and inadequate pain control has a major negative impact on
the quality of life of chronic pain sufferers. Many currently available analgesics display modest efficacy and in
the case of opioids, addiction liability that has resulted in a dramatic increase in opioid abuse and addiction.
Consequently, there is an urgent need to identify novel targets for the development of non-opioid analgesics to
treat chronic pain. Our group has previously identified fatty acid binding protein 5 (FABP5) as an intracellular
carrier for endocannabinoids and structurally related N-acylethanolamines, whose inhibition augments tissue
levels of both lipid classes and produces analgesia. In the periphery, FABP5 inhibition additionally blunts the
release of pro-inflammatory and proalgesic mediators, positioning FABP5 as a promising target for the
development of analgesics. Accordingly, recently developed FABP5 inhibitors display efficacy in a range of pain
models and are rapidly advancing across the preclinical pipeline, with clinical testing scheduled to begin within
several years. Despite the therapeutic potential of FABP5 inhibition in treating pain, our understanding of its
mechanisms of action remains limited. While the majority of FABP5's effects originate from the modulation of
intracellular lipid transport and receptor activation, emerging evidence indicates that subsets of FABPs can be
released from distinct cell populations under specific conditions to exert unique biological functions. In this
application we test the novel hypothesis that inflammation triggers FABP5 secretion, which is instrumental in
delivering proalgesic lipids to nociceptive sensory neurons to maintain hyperalgesia. Conversely, sequestration
of extracellular FABP5 produces antinociceptive effects. Mechanistically, we hypothesize that FABP5 binds to
and delivers a lipid of the leukotriene family to its receptor, in turn sensitizing the nociceptive channels transient
receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) and transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) to sustain pain. Specific
Aim 1 tests the hypothesis that extracellular FABP5 modulates inflammatory pain hypersensitivity and will
interrogate the mechanisms underlying its cellular secretion. Specific Aim 2 tests the hypothesis that inhibition
of extracellular FABP5 or leukotriene signaling blunts inflammatory TRPA1 and TRPV1 sensitization. Specific
Aim 3 seeks to characterize the mechanisms underlying leukotriene-mediated TRPA1 sensitization. Successful
completion of the outlined aims will establish a novel paradigm linking extracellular FABP5 to pain modulation
and will provide a foundation for the development of analgesics targeting FABP5.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Summary
People with psychotic disorders die 10-20 years prematurely, often after years of disability and declining
health. Early-onset dementia is an important contributor to these problems. By age 65, 27% of people with
psychotic disorders are already diagnosed with dementia. The nature of this premature cognitive decline is
unclear, and RFA-MH-22-270 calls for studies to understand the increased risk of dementia in psychotic
disorders. Specifically, it is unknown when the cognitive decline takes place, why it happens, and what are its
functional consequences. The Suffolk County Mental Health Project, a longitudinal epidemiologic study of first-
episode psychosis that begun in 1989, provides an unparalleled opportunity to study cognitive decline in
psychotic disorder during midlife. The study enrolled 628 individuals with psychotic disorders. At Year 20, 261
demographically matched never-psychotic adults were added. The cohorts have been genotyped, and have
received comprehensive psychiatric evaluations, medical exams, physical performance tests, EEG, and
cognitive testing at regular intervals throughout the follow-up period. This created a rich dataset that has
already been the basis of over 115 publications. We propose a 35-year follow-up, when participants will be 65
years old on average (expected N = 530). The proposed study has four aims. First, we will determine whether
the cognitive decline from Year 20 to 35 is faster in cases than never-psychotic controls. Second, we will test if
Year 20 risk factors for cognitive change are the same in cases and controls (e.g., metabolic syndrome,
inactivity, tobacco use, low education, and APOE4) or some differ (e.g., antipsychotics, anticholinergics, and
schizophrenia polygenic risk score). Third, we will investigate in cases whether cognitive decline is associated
with worsening functioning in the real-world (role, social, and self-care), physical impairment, and neural
deficits (EEG and plasma markers). Fourth, we will explore dementia incidence in cases vs. controls and risk
factors for incident dementia. The proposed research will address scientific objectives highlighted in the RFA-
MH-22-270. First, it will explicate trajectories and outcomes of psychotic disorders in mid- to late-life by
studying cognitive and functional changes over 15 years (from mean age 50 to age 65). Second, it will identify
promising targets for future development of preventive interventions by investigating modifiable risk factors.
Third, it will shed light on mechanisms underpinning these trajectories by studying relevant genetic, molecular,
neural, environmental, and behavioral factors.

A significant proportion of individuals receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV-1 infection develop cognitive
deficits. This may be due solely to the HIV-1 infection; however, this may also indicate that prolonged ART itself
may contribute to the impairments, particularly in the context of HIV-1 infection. The latter possibility is of
particular concern given that a growing number of uninfected individuals use antiretrovirals (ARVs) as pre-
exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). The brain circuitry that may be affected by prolonged treatment with ARVs or by
ARVs in the context of HIV-1 infection is unknown.
We propose to apply our recently developed array of new tools for constructing, comparing, and analyzing 3D
whole-brain maps of neuronal activation in the mouse brain to reveal the critical neural circuitry affected by ARVs,
HIV-1 infection, and their combination. Our hypothesis is that 3D patterns of neuronal activation in animals
exposed to ARVs, HIV-1, and ARV/HIV-1 and involved in challenging behavioral tasks can both reveal the
crucial circuitry defining these effects and serve as unique signatures of the treatments' effects.
In specific aim 1, we will determine the critical shared components of neural circuitry affected by prolonged
exposure to select ARVs. We will generate mesoscopic global maps of neuronal activation in mice presented
with relevant cognitive challenges after exposure to ARVs. We will then subject the mapping datasets to our
stepwise selection pipeline to identify the critical brain regions and neural circuits altered by the treatments. In
specific aim 2, we will determine the components of neural circuitry in NOD-hIL-34 mice, a humanized animal
model of HIV-1 infection, that are affected by exposure to select ARVs in the context of infection. Finally, in
specific aim 3, we will validate and extend the conclusions of our in silico investigations: we will monitor neuronal
activity in the candidate regions in vivo on the single-cell and population levels; apply monosynaptic tracing to
determine whether ARV treatment induces long-term changes in neuronal connections; and use chemogenetics
to manipulate neuronal activity in the key components of the inferred circuitry. Our experiments will create a
circuitry map space for the action of ARVs in the context of HIV-1 infection, upon which other circuitry maps that
describe various behavioral states and responses to treatments can be projected and compared. Our results will
help to characterize cognitive impairments in HIV-1 infected individuals receiving ART and in those using ARVs
as PrEP, and will inform future therapeutic efforts to treat HIV-associated neurocognitive impairment.

Long-term memories are often formed when the event involves a threat and triggers survival behavior. Sensory cues present
during the threat tend to elicit defensive behaviors when they occur in the future, indicating that a long-term association has
formed between the cue and the threat. While it is known for decades that the transformation of associative memories from
labile state to long-term form requires new protein synthesis in discrete brain regions, there is a knowledge gap in the
understanding of specific neural pathways that are recruited during memory consolidation and the mechanisms that control
the dynamics of protein synthesis in these pathways. This knowledge is important not only for gaining a deeper
understanding of spatiotemporally resolved protein synthesis in memory processes but also for targeted therapeutic
intervention in disorders of emotional memories such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). PTSD is characterized by
over-consolidation of memory about the traumatic event, inability to discriminate innocuous stimuli from ones that predict
danger, and maladaptive coping strategies. Using Pavlovian and instrumental threat conditioning paradigms in mice, this
proposal aims to understand the neurobiological substrates for the modulation of emotional memories by threat intensity
and volitional control – both of which are disrupted in PTSD. Two key modes for protein synthesis, namely the eukaryotic
initiation factor 2 (eIF2) and eIF4E-dependent translation, are thought to be crucial for associative emotional memories.
The proposed study will use bidirectional strategies to regulate these modes of translation in specific prefrontal pathways
connecting with deep brain regions, including the basolateral amygdala and paraventricular thalamus. Furthermore, this
work will survey learning-induced physiological changes in the brain at the level of cellular-resolution molecular signaling.
Finally, the study plans to determine the changes in the translation landscape in specific prefrontal pathways during the
consolidation of diverse emotional memories that result in cue-elicited freezing or avoidance. To achieve these goals, mouse
models will be used in combination with viral-mediated gene transfer, chemogenetics, pharmacology, imaging, molecular
profiling, and behavior. Findings from this study have the potential to transform the field of memory research by elucidating
the molecular players that govern the consolidation of long-term memories in both healthy and diseased brain states.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Inputting and editing text on smartphones play an important role in people’s daily lives. Studies have
shown that they constitute 40% of one’s smartphone usage. For blind smartphone users, text input and text
editing tasks remain a challenge with studies showing that their typing speed is only 4-5 Words Per Minute
(WPM) on soft keyboards compared to 36 WPM of sighted users. While the use of voicing text input is
becoming prevalent among blind users, studies have shown that they spend 80% of their time on the average
editing spoken text, which is a slow, laborious process. This lack of efficient and convenient text input and
editing methods can make it difficult for blind users to use their smartphones proficiently and productively
for their everyday activities such as staying informed, connecting with friends and colleagues, shopping,
entertainment, travel, and for just about everything.
 This project will research and develop a new generation of intelligent text input and editing methods
that will substantially enhance the proficiency with which blind smartphone users can input and edit text.
To this end, the project has three overarching objectives: First, we will create a non-visual free-form gesture
input method that will enable blind users to enter a word or phrase with free-form touch gestures on the
default Qwerty soft keyboard on smartphones, rather than entering text one letter at a time, an arguably
slow process. It will bring the popular gesture typing method to blind users, and increase their text input
efficiency as it will eliminate the need to confirm each letter during text input. Second, we will create an
intelligent Braille soft keyboard that can automatically correct input errors and do auto-completion of
unseen letters, which until now has been unavailable for Braille. Auto-correction has been shown to reduce
the input errors by over 30% for typing on a Qwerty soft keyboard for sighted users, and introducing it to
Braille soft keyboards would result in an even greater error reduction as touch inputs of blind users are far
more error-prone. Third, we will leverage language models in combination with voicing and touch to
eliminate the tedious operations required by extant methods that rely exclusively on precise cursor
movements for editing erroneous text input, which can occur quite often with spoken text input. Based on
previous studies with sighted users that show a 30-40% gain in editing performance with this approach, we
expect even greater performance gains with blind users as cursor-based operations are far more challenging
for them. Successful accomplishments of these objectives will eliminate any barriers to productivity of
blind smartphone users and empower them to utilize the power and connectivity of these devices to fully
participate in this digitized economy as critical services are increasingly delivered via smartphone devices.

present in tick saliva, injected into the skin during a 15-minute tick bite and causes a 10% fatal encephalitis
resulting in severe long-term neurologic damage in 50% of patients. The incidence of POWV encephalitis in
the elderly remains an enigma with mechanisms of POWV neuroinvasion, CNS cell targeting and
neuroinflammatory pathology, virtually unknown. To reflect POWV spread from skin to the CNS, POWV (LI9)
was isolated from deer ticks directly in epithelial cells. Mice s.c. inoculated with POWV LI9 develop lethal
neurovirulent disease with overt murine brain damage. Noting lethality in older mice, neurovirulence was
assessed as a function of age and found LI9 to be lethal in 90% of 50 wk, and <10% of 10 wk, old C57/Bl6
mice, and consistent with POWV neurovirulence in the elderly. Brains of 50 wk old mice had dramatically
increased viremia, chemokines, immune cell infiltrates and histopathology. LI9 was passage attenuated in IFN
deficient VeroE6 cells and the resulting virus, LI9-P, fails to cause murine disease and protects mice from LI9
challenge. This POWV pair provides a means of defining neurovirulence mechanisms.
 Mechanisms of POWV entry into the CNS remain to be revealed but are likely to be via hematogenous
blood-brain-barrier (BBB) or blood-CSF-barrier (BCSFB) portals. BBB and BCSFBs are distinct and
respectively formed by brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs) and choroid plexus epithelial cells
(CPEpCs). CPEpCs are uniquely responsive to IFNλ, and the BCSFB is the main immune cell gateway into the
CNS. In aged mice upregulated inflammatory IL-1β and IL1R responses are found in choroid plexus cells and
suggest potential mechanisms of age-dependent neuroinflammation.
 POWV LI9 infects CPEPCs and BMECs and regulates IFN responses in vitro. In mice LI9 directed CNS
viremia was dramatically inhibited by post-infection IFNλ treatment. In contrast to LI9, LI9-P highly induces
IFNβ/λ in infected CPEpCs, and failure to regulate IFN responses may explain LI9-P attenuation in mice. These
findings rationalize POWV entry into the CNS via BBB or BCSFB portals, and IFNλ as a key regulator of LI9
neuroinvasion and pathogenesis.
 To define mechanisms of LI9 neurovirulence and LI9-P attenuation a recombinant approach for generating
infectious POWVs and chimeras of LI9 and LI9-P was developed. Studies proposed use single cell RNA
sequencing (scRNAseq), model BBB and BCSFBs and brain slice culture to define CNS cells targeted by
POWVs and mechanisms of LI9 neuroinvasion. Proposed studies analyze cell responses that permit POWV
neuroinvasion and define age-dependent neurovirulence mechanisms using neurovirulent LI9, attenuated LI9-
P and POWV mutants. Findings are likely to reveal responses that direct or restrict CNS damage, and targets
for preventing POWV neurovirulence that may be broadly applicable to other neurovirulent viruses.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：The human fungal pathogen C. albicans causes life-threatening systemic infections and severe
morbidity from mucosal infections. Morphology switching between budding and filamentous growth
is central to C. albicans pathogenesis. The transition to hyphal growth makes C. albicans a more
aggressive pathogen that can infect a broad range of host niches by crossing epithelial and
endothelial barriers and growing invasively into tissues. However, most previous research has
focused on identifying upstream regulators and genes that promote hyphal growth in liquid culture,
which are often not important in vivo. Therefore, little is known about the mechanisms that directly
promote invasive growth of C. albicans in the host. To address this gap, a genetic screen was
used to identify mutants that are strongly defective in invasive growth. The proposed studies will
focus on three sets of these mutants that revealed new mechanisms that are critical for invasion.
Aim 1 will focus on mutants that identified an important role for endocytosis in invasive growth in
vitro and in vivo. These studies are expected to reveal which stages of endocytosis are important
and how they promote plasma membrane organization that is needed for invasive growth. Aim 2
will focus on two other newly discovered functions that mediate novel mechanisms for invasion.
One new function is carried out by Pxl1, which is similar to paxillin proteins that bind stressed actin
filaments to mediate mechano-sensing in mammalian cells. The pxl1D mutant will be investigated
to determine how it plays a role in sensing the surrounding matrix and mediating invasive growth.
The other new function needed for invasive growth involves pathways that regulate trafficking of v-
SNAREs, which are needed for secretion. Defining the role of these trafficking pathways will be
significant because polarized secretion is fundamentally important for hyphal growth. The new
mechanisms will be tested in mouse models of oropharyngeal candidiasis and bloodstream-
disseminated candidiasis to determine how invasive growth is regulated at these very different
sites. Identifying the mechanisms that promote C. albicans invasive growth will create new
avenues for the development of therapeutic approaches.

Visual perception and visually-guided behavior relies on the ability of the brain to combine information about
multiple aspects of a visual scene. In all sighted animals, including humans, the visual system uses parallel
processing strategies to represent different features of a visual scene in different visual pathways or populations of
neurons. How, then, does the brain combine information about these different aspects of the visual world into a
unified visual percept, and how do animals guide behavior based on multiple visual cues that are encoded by
separate pathways? The research performed under this award will answer this question using the visual system of
the fruit fly Drosophila as a model, which allows for the identification and targeting of precise, defined neural
populations that represent visual cues. This work will: (1) Determine how diverse visual features are jointly
represented by populations of visual projection neurons that carry information from the visual system to the rest
of the brain, (2) Determine how interactions among these visual projection pathways shape the visual information
encoded in them, and (3) Determine how different features of a scene are combined to guide animal behavior. This
work will advance the core mission of the National Eye Institute by making contributions to the understanding of
visual function. This research will rely on a wide array of modern approaches in neuroscience, including functional
imaging of brain activity, genetic manipulations, computational and statistical modeling, and behavioral
measurements. In addition to the research described above, this award will support the awardee’s transition to an
independent research career at a research-intensive university and further support the establishment of their visual
neuroscience laboratory.

The spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are a genetically heterogeneous group of rare, dominantly inherited
neurological disorders characterized by progressive ataxia. Although the genetic causes of SCAs are diverse,
multiple SCAs (1,2,3,6,7 & 12) are caused by CAG expansion mutations and they share the production of CAG
expansion RNAs and in most cases, the expression of toxic polyglutamine containing proteins. Despite these
shared features, there are no cross-disease therapeutic approaches for these disorders, and we lack a clear
understanding of the precise molecular mechanisms responsible for disease pathogenesis. Our central
hypothesis is that targeting CAG expansions with small molecules will provide therapeutic efficacy across
multiple SCAs. To test this hypothesis, we leveraged our extensive experience from developing small molecules
that target CUG expansion RNAs in myotonic dystrophy (DM). We generated a CAG expansion reporter cell line
with an integrated (CAG)60 lacking genomic context of any SCA gene. Using this cell line, we have identified
small molecules that selectively reduce levels of CAG transcripts across SCA1, SCA3 and SCA7 patient-derived
fibroblasts and SCA1 mice providing proof-of-concept for a cross-disease small molecule approach for CAG
expansion SCAs. In this study, we will leverage our CAG screening system and established pipeline to identify
FDA-approved small molecules and natural products with therapeutic efficacy across CAG SCAs. Interestingly,
transcriptomic characterization of our CAG reporter line identified gene expression signatures that are also found
in SCA mouse models, as well as widespread alternative splicing dysregulation. Changes in alternative splicing
are a molecular feature for many repeat expansion diseases including DM, suggesting alternative splicing may
be a novel CAG-dependent transcriptomic hallmark of SCAs. Indeed, we identified widespread alternative
splicing in SCA patient-derived fibroblasts and published RNA-Seq data from across CAG SCA mouse models,
including presymptomatic animals. In DM, specific mis-spliced events are directly connected with disease
outcomes and can be used as target engagement biomarkers for lead candidate prioritization in preclinical
therapy studies. We propose that dysregulation of alternative splicing provides a missing link between
presymptomatic transcriptional changes and dysregulation of key cellular pathways in CAG expansion SCAs. To
address this, we propose to identify alternative splicing events that contribute to disease onset and neuronal
dysfunction in the human neuronal context and to assess the feasibility of measuring alternative splicing
dysregulation and rescue to aid in cross CAG SCA lead compound prioritization. Together these studies will
identify novel, clinic-ready CAG selective compounds and will help to accelerate these compounds towards
clinical testing as well as identifying novel therapeutic targets that may serve as the basis for future investigations.
This work will have broad implications for therapeutic development and our understanding of disease across
CAG SCAs, non-CAG SCAs, CAG repeat diseases and the broad class of microsatellite expansion disorders.

Powassan virus (family Flaviviridae) is a reemerging tickborne virus endemic in North America and Russia. In
1997, a POWV-like agent was isolated from Ixodes scapularis in New England and determined to be genetically
distinct from the original human isolate. This revealed the existence of two lineages: lineage I, POWV (POWV
L1) and lineage II, deer tick virus (POWV L2). POWV L1 is maintained between I. cookei and woodchucks and
I. marxi and arboreal squirrels, while POWV L2 is maintained in I. scapularis and small mammalian hosts. This
distinction suggests an evolutionary progression of either POWV L1 or L2 into unique transmission cycles and
subsequent adaption to these new hosts. Tick, mammalian, and human isolates from New York State (NYS) are
typically identified as POWV L2, but for the first time in 45 years three POWV L1 isolates were detected including
isolations from I. cookei and the first known isolation of POWV L1 from I. scapularis. Additionally, within the same
timeframe in NYS, POWV L1 was identified in Dermacentor variabilis and POWV L2 in Amblyomma
americanum. With few available isolates, especially POWV L1, little work has been done to elucidate genetic
correlates that confer tick host specificity or the role of tick host responses in driving host-specific adaptation.
Therefore, the goal of this study is to utilize our emergent POWV isolates to understand genetic
correlates of tick host specificity and to investigate the potential for further adaptation to distinct tick
hosts. My previous work suggests introduction of POWV L1 into new tick hosts like I. scapularis facilitates viral
diversification and emergence of host-driven adaptations in proteins involved in immune evasion and replication.
Therefore, I hypothesize introduction of POWV L1 into distinct tick species leads to emergence of tick-specific
substitutions that contribute to increased viral fitness. Additionally, I hypothesize these changes will be tick
specific with distinct adaptation of POWV occurring dependent on tick species. To test this, I propose to:
AIM 1: Investigate the role of tick-driven, emergent substitutions in NS4b on viral fitness using a novel
POWV L1 infectious clone
AIM 2: perform experimental evolution of POWV in distinct tick species: Ixodes scapularis, Dermacentor
variabilis, and Amblyomma americanum to assess changes in viral diversity and describe tick antiviral
responses to POWV
These studies will help further our understanding of POWV adaptation to novel hosts and host-specific, genetic
correlates that influence viral fitness. Additionally, these studies will contribute to the poorly understood tick
antiviral responses to POWV infection. Overall, this work may act as a model for tickborne virus spread and
establishment in new transmission cycles.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
Our long-term goal is to prevent blindness, either by interfering with disease progression or by developing cell
replacement therapies to restore vision. We believe that microRNAs (miRNAs) are a very powerful and innovative
tool to accomplish this, but we first need to identify the set of miRNAs required for retinal cell fate specification
and proper cell function in the developing retina. These miRNAs might represent potential therapeutic agents to
not only restore imbalances that occur with the onset of retinal disorders, but also to induce specific cell fates for
Müller glia (MG) reprogramming. We therefore propose to investigate the role of retinal progenitor cell (RPC)-
miRNAs for late-stage RPC state and function and MG reprogramming by Aim 1: identifying the specific miRNAs
required in early postnatal development, when rod photoreceptors (PR), bipolar cells (BCs), and MG are
generated. Aim 2: testing miRNAs to reprogram MG into functional retinal neurons with focus on BCs and rod
PR. We propose to use a mouse line that will not be able to produce miRNAs in their RPCs to better understand
the function of miRNAs in retinal development and diseases. We will analyze tissue and cells with regard to
morphological and functional alterations and determine which miRNAs are responsible for changes in cellular
behavior. If we discover certain cell types that do not form properly without miRNAs, this could mean that specific
miRNAs are required for proper development of that cell type. Rescue experiments will show whether disturbed
tissue can be restored by miRNA supplementation and would imply potential therapeutic use. These miRNAs
might also be new, additional reprogramming factors to regenerate specific cell types from stem cells or MG. My
previous work has shown that miRNAs can reprogram MG into neuronal-like cells similar to BCs. However,
whether these reprogrammed neurons are functional, and whether other neurons are generated, is still unknown.
To address these questions, we will reprogram primary MG from reporter mice to visualize the conversion of MG
into RPCs and neuronal-like cells, use patch clamp to measure ion currents, and profile their gene expression.
miRNA candidates that successfully converted MG into functional neurons will be tested subsequently in 3D
organotypic cultures (intact retinas outside the organism). Explants will be treated with miRNAs and evaluated
with regard to cell proliferation and proper differentiation capability. miRNA candidates that can induce MG
reprogramming ex vivo will be utilized for in vivo reprogramming approaches. To reveal underlying mechanisms
and true miRNAs targets, we will use target prediction and target validation tools to narrow down and test
selected candidates via sensors (in vitro proof of miRNA:mRNA prediction) and rescue experiments. This work
provides a comprehensive study of miRNAs by combining molecular and cellular analyses with functional testing,
in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo and will reveal (1) the set miRNAs required for proper retinal development and cell
fate specification of late-born retinal neurons and (2) the set of miRNAs that can reprogram MG into functional
neurons.

This proposal presents a four-year Research Career Development program focused on
understanding the mechanisms by which myopia increases glaucoma susceptibility. The
candidate is currently a Clinical Instructor/PhD candidate with 80% protected research time, who
was the first to complete the combined Residency/PhD program at the SUNY College of
Optometry. The proposal builds on the candidate’s previous clinical and research experience in
ocular disease, myopia, and glaucoma, and integrates her mentors’ unique fields of expertise.
Under the guidance of her primary mentor and co-mentors Drs. Alexandra Benavente-Perez,
Stewart Bloomfield, Miduturu Srinivas and Suresh Viswanathan, she will gain a deeper
understanding of cellular and electrophysiology methodologies applied to this proposal. The
research plan proposed will provide a distinctive set of multidisciplinary skills to develop the
candidate into an independent investigator in the translational research field of myopic
complications, in particular glaucoma.
Myopia is projected to become a public health crisis that will affect half the world population by
2050, and is characterized by excessive eye growth that can affect the structure and function of
vital cells that form the retinal neurovascular unit. Glaucoma is a multifactorial blinding disease
estimated to affect more than 120 million people worldwide by 2040. While strong evidence
confirms that myopic patients are at higher risk of glaucomatous degeneration, the mechanisms
behind this association are unknown. Our current understanding of this relationship has two major
gaps: 1) the longitudinal effect that myopic eye growth and stretch have on the cellular structure
and function of ganglion cells, glia and vasculature remains unknown, and 2) there are no non-
human primate (NHP) animal models that combine myopia and glaucoma to study how myopic
progression predisposes the retina to glaucomatous remodeling. I hypothesize that myopia and
glaucoma are linked via the effect that myopic stretch has on the neurovascular unit. The overall
goals of this proposal are to define the longitudinal effect that myopia has on 1) retinal ganglion
cells, 2) astrocytes and 3) associated vasculature, and their relationship with glaucoma
susceptibility. This proposal is innovative because it focuses on studying longitudinally three key
neurovascular elements affected by myopia, using a novel NHP experimental model with anatomy
and physiology comparable to the human eye, and induced with myopia and subsequently
glaucoma. This research will have a direct positive impact and is significant because it is expected
to provide strong evidence of the unknown nature of the myopia-glaucoma relationship.

In addition to its pivotal roles in regulating cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, DNA repair, and metabolism, the p53
tumor suppressor has been demonstrated to modulate innate immune and adaptive immune responses through
its crosstalk with key regulators of immune signaling pathways. The dysregulation of Interleukin 17 (IL17)
cytokine family and its receptors has been associated with many human diseases, notably inflammation and
cancer, crediting to their crucial roles in normal host immune responses. Particularly, Interleukin 17 Receptor B
(IL17RB) has been found to be overexpressed in various cancers through the activation of NFB, AKT, or ERK
signaling to promote tumorigenesis. Our preliminary results indicate that IL17RB is a p53 repression target and
repression of IL17RB sustains the p53 response. Additionally, activation of p53 by nutlin-3a or IL17RB depletion
decreases the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokine IL8 induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The goal of
this application is to study the role of p53-mediated IL17RB repression in tumor suppression and inflammation
inhibition. We established systems of IL17RB repression, overexpression, and activation, that will enable
biochemical and cellular characterization as well as in-depth gene expression analyses to elucidate the
contribution of IL17RB repression to tumor suppressive and inflammation inhibitory function of p53. The
proposed work will not only allow us to gain a better understanding on how IL17RB links p53’s crosstalk with
other signaling pathways and how p53 attenuates oncogenic effects of chronic inflammation through repressing
IL17RB, but also provide a mechanistic basis for the development of novel anti-cancer strategies as well as
inflammation inhibitors. In addition, this project will enhance the research environment at St. John’s University
by providing undergraduate and graduate students with numerous opportunities to learn the fundamentals of
biomedical research.

 The patient-clinician interaction is central to most therapies and is supported by key interpersonal
mechanisms of action such as clinician empathy, therapeutic alliance, and trust. However, the neural
underpinnings of this effect are mostly unknown. Our recently published study applied functional MRI (fMRI)
hyperscanning (i.e. simultaneously neuroimaging chronic pain patients and clinicians in synchronized MRI
scanners) demonstrated that brain-to-brain concordance in the temporoparietal junction (TPJ) is up-regulated
following a clinical interaction and associated with patient analgesia. Our study also found that greater facial
expression mirroring is associated with higher therapeutic alliance and greater evoked pain analgesia.
Interestingly, the TPJ is known to be a key region for theory-of-mind processing (ToM, i.e. mentalizing,
perspective-taking), defined as the ability to infer and understand others’ mental states - a cognitive function
critical for social communication, empathy, and social mirroring. Furthermore, ToM training protocols have
been found to improve mentalizing ability, which can generalize to other cognitive / quality of life functions. We
propose that patient/clinician TPJ concordance, linked with ToM processing, is a key aspect of therapeutic
alliance, and thus ToM training for fibromyalgia patients will increase alliance, facial expression mirroring, and
TPJ concordance, with the latter mediating improvements in pain outcomes following acupuncture therapy, an
established non-pharmacological therapy for chronic pain. Fibromyalgia is a nociplastic chronic pain disorder
showing a deficit in ToM processing, potentially contributing to the difficulties in social functioning
characterizing this condition, and in great need of novel therapies. Our study will evaluate the impact of a novel
multimodal therapy, a type of approach known to improve pain outcomes and recommended by the Institute of
Medicine report for chronic pain management. Our study design will also allow us to evaluate a neural model
supporting therapeutic alliance for pain outcomes for fibromyalgia wherein combined ToM training and
acupuncture will synergistically target a critical therapeutic pathway - i.e., patient-provider alliance, instantiated
by TPJ concordance. Our Aims will: (1) Determine behavioral and neurophysiological effects of ToM training,
(2) Evaluate the impact of ToM training on brain-to-brain concordance with fMRI hyperscanning, and (3)
Assess if brain/behavioral markers mediate the effect of ToM training on longitudinal acupuncture outcomes.

Skeletal muscle has a remarkable regenerative capability when the extent of the injury is relatively minor.
However, following traumatic muscle injuries such as volumetric muscle loss (VML), the endogenous repair
potential of skeletal muscle becomes inadequate, which causes physical disability and adversely influences the
quality of life. Biomaterial scaffolds hold great promise for improving the functional recovery of skeletal muscle
by providing both physical and biochemical cues to facilitate cell adhesion, migration, proliferation, and
differentiation. Particularly, acellular scaffolds are promising and clinically transformative as they obviate
limitations associated with using exogenous cells, including limited sources and immunogenicity. However,
existing acellular bioscaffolds have failed to induce the formation of a sufficient amount of de novo myofibers
and achieve appreciable muscle functional improvement, limitations that have been largely attributed to the poor
ability of acellular scaffolds to recruit endogenous cells, especially muscle stem cells (MuSCs). Therefore,
developing an acellular scaffold capable of active cell recruitment represents a major technological advance in
the treatment of VML. Inspired by the native tissues such as skin that generate electrical signals to guide cell
migration during injury repair, we propose to develop a biodegradable piezoelectric scaffold comprised of a fibrin-
based hydrogel containing boron nitride nanotubes (fibrin/BNNTs). Our scaffold is designed to convert
mechanical stimuli (e.g., via ultrasound and exercise-induced muscle contraction) to electrical signals with the
goal of promoting cell recruitment. In this proposal, we will test our central hypothesis that, upon ultrasound
stimulation, fibrin/BNNTs piezoelectric scaffolds enhance endogenous cell recruitment and MuSC differentiation,
thus accelerating the functional recovery of skeletal muscle after VML. Two specific aims are proposed to test
our central hypothesis. Specific Aim 1 studies will optimize the fibrin/BNNTs scaffold composition and ultrasound
stimulation to promote MuSC recruitment and myogenic differentiation in vitro using a novel 3D VML muscle
construct model. In Specific Aim 2, using our validated VML male and female mouse models, we will evaluate
the ability of ultrasound-stimulated piezoelectric scaffolds to promote in vivo skeletal muscle regeneration, and
we will evaluate whether these effects are sex-dependent. We anticipate that the successful completion of these
studies will not only offer a promising new strategy for enhancing skeletal muscle regeneration but also provide
novel insights into scaffold design for other applications, such as skin and cardiac regeneration.

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive, neurodegenerative condition that impacts 44 million people globally.
It is the most common cause of dementia—accounting for 80% of all dementia diagnoses—and predominantly
affects older people. To date, AD has no cure. Thus, it is imperative to diagnose patients as early as possible to
maximize the efficacy of symptom management strategies. However, existing AD diagnostic and monitoring
options remain subpar, leaving urgent need for sensitive, reliable, and convenient methods to measure AD.
New research suggests that electroencephalography (EEG) -based biomarkers can assess neural degeneration
caused by AD long before tissue loss or behavioral symptoms appear. SPARK Neuro aims to unlock the full
potential of EEG through a novel software platform: SPARK Scan. Combining EEG with the capabilities of
machine learning, SPARK Scan better assesses cognitive health and neurodegeneration, aiding the diagnosis
of AD. In the proposed Direct-to-Phase II SBIR project, the company will enhance the existing SPARK platform
by developing a novel Alzheimer’s Disease Pathology Index that tracks patient amyloid and tau burden.
Developed with CSF data collected from Johns Hopkins University, the Pathology Index will be a continuous
score that corresponds to a patient’s pathological disease burden. After updating the software, the SPARK team
will employ Human Factors testing to enhance the usability and utility of the updated platform and clinical report
before submitting findings for FDA De Novo approval. This work will progress the SPARK platform by providing
a granular measure of AD-related pathology, extending beyond current capabilities.

In Nigeria, cancer is a significant and growing public health threat. Given the rising incidence and poor
outcomes associated with cancer in the region, the Nigerian Ministry of Health has designated cancer
as a priority area for research and training. To support this, we propose a new training program – the
Nigerian Cancer Research Training (NCAT) program – with the goal of increasing capacity for cancer
research in Nigeria. We seek to not only strengthen the existing research enterprise but to build in-
country expertise and provide a solid foundation for the development, implementation, and
dissemination of evidence-based interventions that will impact public health policy, as well as clinical
practice, care, and treatment for cancer patients. The NCAT program will build on existing relationships
and infrastructure established over the past decade between Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center
(MSK) in the US, Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU) in Nigeria, and the College of Medicine/Lagos
University Teaching Hospital (CMUL/LUTH) in Nigeria. We will employ a multi-level approach to
strengthen research capacity for individuals (Aim 1) and institutions (Aim 2), while also enhancing
broader relationships at national, regional, and global levels (Aim 3). The NCAT program will address
two distinct needs for cancer research training in Nigeria: 1. a training program that can be used for
clinical faculty (primarily physicians and nurses) that will not interfere with clinical/research duties, and
2. a training program to bolster the capacity of full-time PhD-level researchers in the disciplines of
cancer epidemiology, behavioral sciences, and biostatistics. Trainees will be competitively selected,
and we will emphasize diversity and underrepresented specialties (e.g., nursing, psycho-oncology). A
multi-pronged training approach, utilizing coursework, “hands-on” research in ongoing breast and
colorectal cancer studies, virtual learning, mentorship, and collaboration will be used to train a cadre of
multidisciplinary Nigerian cancer researchers. After a one-year cancer research training period, NCAT
trainees will be grouped into research teams and take part in team science-based training, which will
include designing and conducting a collaborative mentored pilot research project in Nigeria. In addition,
to enhance support for local researchers beyond the project period, we will develop cancer research
training courses to be used in Nigeria, and provide mentorship and training to research administration
offices at OAU and CMUL/LUTH. We will use multiple layers of trainee and project assessment to
ensure that our program is meeting its ultimate goal of creating well-trained colorectal and breast cancer
researchers and a sustainable pipeline for continued cancer research in Nigeria.

 During mammalian development, a single cell gives rise to thousands of diverse and functionally
distinct cell-types. Understanding how each cell-type is determined during development is one of the central
questions in biology with far-reaching consequences for human health and regenerative medicine. While much
of our current understanding of how cell-fate decisions are made is based on either temporally-resolved and
non-destructive methods (e.g., time-lapse microscopy) or high-throughput but destructive genomic assays
(e.g., single-cell RNA-seq), a new method that allows continual observation of each cell throughout the
developmental process will fill the major gaps existing in our understanding of cell-fate transitions during
mammalian development.
 Here we propose to develop molecular recording methods that enable the concurrent, non-destructive,
high-throughput measurements of past cellular events and the current cell-type. Our recent methods, DNA
Typewriter and ENGRAM, use precision genome editing to record cell lineage information and key
transcriptional signaling events to the cell’s genome, which are recovered along with the transcriptome at the
single-cell level. During the mentored K99 phase, I will further improve our methods by increasing the lineage
recording efficiency (Aim 1) and testing it in the synthetic mammalian embryo systems (Aim 2). After I
transition to independence in the R00 phase, I will expand the molecular recorder platform to concurrently
capture diverse key cellular events (Aim 3). As our preliminary data on DNA Typewriter and ENGRAM
demonstrate, we are in a strong position to carry out described molecular recording in model development
systems. We anticipate that molecular recording of lineage and key signaling events in the synthetic embryo
systems will deepen our model of early mammalian development. Together, our proposal will serve as a strong
foundation as I transition into my independence and continue developing a general molecular recording
platform.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is one of the earliest and most noticeable symptoms associated with
Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) and other AD Related Dementias (ADRD). There is no cure for ADRD, and
conventional treatments only target more disease stages. Notably, MCI associated with AD typically occurs after
AD biomarkers (related to β-amyloid and tau pathologies) are detectable in patients, creating a narrow window
prior to MCI-AD onset and diagnosis, termed preclinical AD, where interventions slowing MCI onset have the
potential to greatly improve patient quality of life and dramatically reduce costs of AD care at large. However,
developing pharmaceutical treatments for preclinical AD must meet high safety margins given the duration of
treatment, and past attempts have failed to show efficacy. Recently, approvals of antidepressants like ketamine
and brexanolone (both 2019) and the resurgence of psychedelic research has highlighted the power of
neuroplasticity modifiers – compounds driving the creation or modulation of synaptic connections within the brain
– for modifying neurological function to impact mental health. Engaging neuroplasticity mechanisms through
pharmacological means or holistic approaches (i.e. exercise & dietary changes) has been shown to positively
enhance cognition and memory. Notably, some of the most potent neuroplasticity modulators are Natural
Products (NPs) derived from medicinal plants and herbs used by humans for centuries. As such, NPs have been
the subject of numerous studies investigating their potential to improve cognition and progression to MCI in AD.
However, incomplete descriptions of NP molecular targets, mechanisms of action, stability, purity, potency and
bioavailability have largely prevented their development as clinical drug candidates. What’s more, the quantity
of known NPs found in botanical products numbers in the tens of thousands. To identify and develop
psychoactive natural products that impact neuroplasticity and can slow MCI onset, Sensorium Therapeutics is
expanding the capacity of their Biodynamic Discovery PlatformTM (BDP). Our novel BDPTM leverages AI-assisted
analysis of ethnobotanical data and medicinal chemistry coupled with in vitro high-throughput screening using
human iPSCs to provide an effective drug development pipeline for identifying novel NPs as MCI-AD treatments.
Our platform has already led to the identification of a leading natural product drug candidate for depression and
anxiety. Additionally, we have identified a class of botanically-derived alkaloid compounds that have favorable
CNS pharmacological profiles, excellent chemical and in vitro safety, and are linked to improving cognitive
function in humans. The overarching goal of this Fast Track proposal is to expand our BDPTM to include scalable
cellular/neuronal readouts of neuroplasticity while incorporating MCI-AD in vitro models (Phase I) and identify
and validate NP candidate efficacy for MCI-AD treatment (Phase II). Successful completion of this Fast Track
project will generate NP candidates for further development and demonstrate efficacy for Sensorium’s
Biodynamic Discovery PlatformTM in identifying lead candidates for MCI-AD treatments.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：We propose to develop rectal cancer organoids (tumoroids) as
individualized models and to build a large rectal cancer tumoroid repository. Research on rectal cancers is
hampered by the paucity of models. Of the few existing in vivo models of rectal cancer, none place the tumors
in the rectal lumen, so the models fail to mimic the correct anatomic environment and local invasion. The
existing models also have not been observed to metastasize. Another problem is that we lack accurate means
to predict whether individual rectal cancer patients will respond to chemotherapy or radiation, both of which are
part of the current standard of care. We believe that both the paucity of models and the lack of predictive tools
can be addressed by patient-derived tumoroids. Tumoroids can be grown in 3-dimensional culture ex vivo or
implanted into mice, so they offer a flexible research platform. In preliminary results, we have derived tumoroid
lines from multiple patients' rectal cancers and found them to resemble the corresponding patient tumors. The
tumoroids, when implanted in mice endoluminally (i.e. in the rectum), formed locally invasive tumors capable of
metastasis. Moreover, we found tumoroids to have clinically relevant responses to chemotherapy and
radiation. Thus, drawing from these preliminary data, we hypothesize that rectal cancer tumoroids mirror the
traits of their original tumors, can be used to predict patients' response to therapy, and, when implanted
endoluminally into mice, can serve as an optimal model of rectal cancer.
We plan to develop 100 new tumoroids, which we expect to encompass much of the diversity of human rectal
adenocarcinoma. The tumoroids will be analyzed in ex vivo culture and in two mouse models: the endoluminal
implantation model and a conventional flank injection model. In these settings, we will test whether the
tumoroid accurately reflects its tumor of origin in terms of mutations, histology, and gene expression. We will
determine whether response of the tumoroids to patient-specific chemotherapy and radiation can predict the
corresponding patient's response. Of particular interest is whether individual human rectal cancers are more
accurately modeled by endoluminal implantation than by flank injection. Finally, to integrate our findings into a
comprehensive platform for broad use, we will develop a rectal cancer tumoroid biorepository seamlessly
integrated with online pathologic, genomic, and model-specific information. The online platform will be built
within our institution's cancer genomics portal, then integrated into the NCIP Hub. We have assembled a
collaborative team with expertise in colorectal surgical oncology, radiation oncology, and pathology; organoids;
mouse models; biostatistics; and bioinformatics. We anticipate that the proposed research will credential
tumoroids as accurate models for rectal cancer research and for predicting patient responses to therapy. The
large tumoroid biorepository is likely to stimulate research on new treatments for rectal cancer. The ultimate
result will be new treatment options and better treatment selection for patients affected by this deadly disease.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：The prognosis of HPV+ oropharyngeal cancer (OPC) treated with standard radiation at 70 Gy is excellent.
However, 80% of these patients experience grade ≥2 mucositis and 30% have permanent swallowing
dysfunction. Clinical data suggest that 70 Gy may be overtreatment for some HPV+ OPCs. A modest
reduction of 10-16 Gy for an unselected cohort with HPV+ OPC showed a 2-year progression-free survival
(PFS) of 80%, but 40% of patients still had difficulty swallowing at 1 year. The proposed research will employ
imaging (PET/MRI) biomarkers to identify patients with HPV+ OPC who may benefit from a major dose
reduction to 30 Gy, a dose based on experience in HPV+ anal cancer, with the goal of maintaining tumor
control and cure while substantially reducing treatment-related toxicity. A pilot trial of 19 HPV+ OPC patients
treated at 30 Gy followed by neck dissection was encouraging, with a 2-year PFS of 93%. Significant toxicity
reduction was observed. The proposed research will expand on the initial findings of the proof- of-principle
study to a larger cohort of patients. The proposed imaging metrics to select patients for major dose de-
escalation will include baseline and early intra-treatment [18F]-FMISO PET imaging, which will provide
information on tumor hypoxia, a marker of radioresistance (Aim 1). Eligible patients will have no evidence of
hypoxia on baseline imaging or have resolution of hypoxia during treatment, which will portend tumor
radiosensitivity. We will interrogate the tumor microenvironment (Aim 2) by deriving quantitative imaging
biomarkers (QIBs) from multi-parametric diffusion-weighted MRI (DW-MRI) consisting of non-Gaussian
intravoxel incoherent motion (NG-IVIM) as well as [18F]-FMISO) PET imaging to select appropriate 30 Gy
candidates to avoid neck dissection, with the goal of further toxicity reduction. The change in intra-
treatment diffusion (D, surrogate of tumor cellularity) and kurtosis (K, surrogate of tissue microstructure) from
baseline DW-MRI will guide which patients de-escalated to 30 Gy can avoid neck dissection. HPV is known to
dysregulate the DNA damage response (DDR) and double-strand break (DSB) repair pathways to facilitate
viral replication. Preclinical work suggests that this dysregulation accounts for the radiosensitivity of HPV+
OPC, although there are conflicting data regarding the precise nature of the responsible defect. For Aim 3,
whole-genome sequencing (WGS) with mutational signature analyses will be used to identify DDR and
DSB repair defects in individual HPV tumors and characterize the clinical influence on radiosensitivity. The
relationship between genomic signatures and non-invasive imaging of tumor hypoxia and tumor cellularity that
portend radiobiological sensitivity also will be explored. The proposal's central hypothesis is that PET/MRI of
HPV+ OPC classification with the underpinnings of a molecular characterization of the cancer biology will
yield a robust decision tool to stratify patients for whom dose de-escalation to 30 Gy will provide a
clinical benefit and significantly reduced toxicity, without compromising treatment outcome.

and has resulted in a pressing need for a workforce with quantitative skills. To meet this need we used our first
NCI R25 funding period to establish the Quantitative Sciences Undergraduate Research Experience (QSURE)
at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK) in Summer 2018. QSURE provides experiential learning
over a 10-week period for up to 10 students in quantitative fields powered by the application of real-world data,
including biostatistics, epidemiology, health outcomes, and computational oncology. In only 5 years, QSURE
has demonstrated substantial demand for quantitative training and expanded the volume of students who
successfully engage in hands-on research in our department by nearly 4-fold. We have achieved the aims of
the first funding period and reported high post-program student and mentor satisfaction as well as improved
student competencies in all years. Most QSURE alumni (71%) have gone on to pursue a PhD or Master’s in a
quantitative field. We will build on these successes and use the next funding period to continue to cultivate a
cadre of responsible, rigorous quantitative scientists through an intensive multidimensional curriculum that
reinforces successful programmatic components, including hands-on research carried out under the guidance
of a faculty mentor, discussion series in the ethical and responsible conduct of research, educational seminars
illustrating wide applications of data, training workshops in quantitative methodology, training and opportunities
for written/oral scientific communication, and career and professional development. We will integrate new
components that address contemporary viewpoints in cancer research and prompt students to consider equity,
diversity, and inclusion in their own research. These will include patient led “fireside chats” that highlight the
role of research in the patient experience, panel discussions that provide global health perspectives through
exchanges with an NCI-funded program for Nigerian trainees, and student-led discussions of works that
reinforce themes in equity, diversity, and inclusion. We will recruit diverse cohorts of motivated undergraduate
interns with a passion for applying quantitative science to reduce cancer morbidity and mortality and evaluate
short- and long-term program success and use these outcomes to inform and disseminate best practices.
Since initial funding QSURE has demonstrated success and resilience in preparing and facilitating the next
generation of research scientists for graduate studies and careers in quantitative fields. During the next funding
period, we will reinforce the successes of our first funding period by designing an enhanced curriculum to help
students contextualize and broaden their understanding of the potential of quantitative science to advance and
support the health of all communities. QSURE will continue to prepare and facilitate interns for graduate
studies and careers in quantitative fields. This is vital to fulfilling our long-term vision of training strong
quantitative scientists dedicated to advancing cancer research.

The Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK) Summer Research Fellowship Program is a cancer
education program that enables 30 first- and second-year U.S. medical students to participate in laboratory and
clinical research under the mentorship of MSK’s clinical faculty. Launched in 1977, this program has enabled
approximately 1,610 medical students to contribute to the research enterprise of a premier academic medical
center. Program participants can work with mentors and in labs centrally involved in both basic and clinical
research; attend MSK’s abundant didactic opportunities; learn how to blend lessons from science and clinical
practice; and present their work to a range of audiences.
The MSK Summer Research Fellowship Program helps address two significant challenges in the field of
oncology.
• The need for more oncologists, especially physician-scientists: In a 2014 report, the American
 Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) projected a shortage of oncologists over the next decade due to
 several factors, including the aging population and an aging oncology workforce. Also, in 2014, the NIH
 issued a report that anticipates that the rising generation of physician-scientists will be insufficient to
 replace those nearing retirement age. The rapidly advancing field of cancer care requires an oncology
 workforce of appropriately trained and engaged physician-scientists that can maintain the pace of
 translation research developments. This program aims to ameliorate this shortage by engaging students’
 interest in oncology research careers.
• The need for more physicians from underrepresented minority populations: The report from ASCO
 described a need for greater racial and ethnic diversity in the physician workforce. This program has
 been able to grow in both size and diversity through the support of MSK’s Office of Diversity Programs.
 In the most recent grant cycle, approximately half of our participants were from underrepresented minority
groups.

Our understanding of DNA replication and its relationship with chromatin structure, nuclear organization
and gene transcription has advanced significantly through the development of genome-wide assays. Most
genome-wide tools to study DNA replication utilize large populations of cells and report on the average
behavior of the population; as such, many infrequent or stochastic events that occur as the replication fork
progresses through chromatin are missed. Recently, we have developed novel methods to map DNA
replication with single-molecule and single-nucleotide precision. In this proposal we will apply this new
technology to understand how DNA synthesis can be completed when the replication machinery
encounters obstacles. We will specifically test how RNA/DNA hybrids and G-quadruplex DNA influence
the progression of DNA replication and whether DNA synthesis can be efficiently restarted downstream of
an impediment. In addition to understanding the progression of replication through chromatin, we will also
investigate how replication is competed during the process of termination. Using high-resolution assays,
we have uncovered a critical role for the DNA helicase Rrm3 in replication termination. We will further
define the role played by Rrm3 and test a novel hypothesis that Rrm3 may prevent catastrophic re-
replication of the genome.

Reproducible assembly of protein molecules from free amino acids requires external information stored
in DNA/RNA (genome). In contrast, assembly of higher-order structures from individual protein molecules
is thought to occur de novo, relying on information intrinsic to each protein component. How higher-order
complexity emerges efficiently without error using only the scattered information in each building block
remains a question hindering core understandings of life. Here we address this question using the
biogenesis of the centriole organelle as the example. We found that a proteinaceous structure called the
cartwheel is grown inside existing centrioles, which is then split, shed and used as structural templates
(or guidance) for reproducing a copy of the centriole with the same size/shape. Uncontrolled cartwheel
shedding was further found to underly a human disease called Alström syndrome. By erasing the old
guidance, we showed that new/naive centrioles varying widely in size and shape arise, which can
propagate reproducibly thereafter in cells otherwise genetically identical. The simplest model explaining
our results is that one or more steps of centriole biogenesis are template-based, instructed by information
stored and transmitted outside of the genome. This model on which the current proposal is based on will
shed light on how cellular complexity emerges reproducibly from components randomly distributed in the
cell, redefining the scope of biological information as we currently understood.

The success of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy in solid tumors requires antigen targets with no
on-target, off-tumor toxicity, effective tumor infiltration, cytotoxicity and proliferation in an immunosuppressive
environment, and revival of antigen stress-induced exhausted CAR T cells. We translated CD28-costimulated
CARs (M28z) that target mesothelin (MSLN), a cancer-associated antigen that we have documented
expression in majority of solid tumors; 64 patients have been treated to date, with no on-target, off-tumor
toxicity. Having demonstrated that regionally administered CAR T cells avoid pulmonary sequestration and
benefit from early antigen-activated CD4 helper CAR T-cell function, we delivered CAR T cells intrapleurally in
patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM), promoting tumor infiltration. To address T-cell
exhaustion, we either treated patients with anti-PD1 agent after CAR T cells or employed tumor-specific
checkpoint blockade by CAR T-cell intrinsic PD1 dominant negative receptor (PD1DNR); 34 patients have
been treated to date, with no CAR- or PD1DNR-related toxicities and with responses by imaging, and
increased survival. To promote IFNγ-mediated cytotoxicity shown to be essential for solid tumor killing, we
exploited a c-KIT mutation, D816V (KITv), as a costimulatory domain. KITv CAR T cells show antigen-
activation induced IFNγ signaling, enhanced cytotoxicity, and when added as signal 3 to CD28 (signal 2),
provide a synergistic function, resist TGFβ-mediated suppression, and prolong functional persistence.
Clinically available kinase inhibitors provide an on/off, tunable safety switch for KITv CAR T cells. To effectively
deliver these next-generation CAR T cells to solid tumors, we developed a translational strategy of non-
ablative, tumor-targeted radiation therapy (RT) to generate a chemokine gradient that facilitates systemically
administered CAR T-cell chemotaxis, tumor infiltration, proliferation, and persistence. Herein, we seek to
translate the M28zKITv-PD1DNR CAR T cells to address key limitations in solid tumor cell therapy. In UG3
phase, we will explore the hypothesis that PD1DNR checkpoint blockade extends beyond tumor cells and
counteracts PDL1-expressing M2 macrophages with immune suppressor function (Aim 1). We will define
optimal regimen of non-ablative, tumor-targeted RT to promote tumor infiltration of systemically administered
CAR T cells, achieving efficacy similar to that with regional delivery. In Aim 3, we will submit an IND
application, a process with which we are familiar and have track record of success. In UH3 phase, we will
conduct a phase I study to investigate the safety, functional activity and efficacy, and markers of response in
patients with MPM. The significance of our approach lies in its effective combination of solid tumor-specific–
scFv that is on-target and safe (MSLN), costimulatory domains (CD28, KITv), checkpoint blockade (PD1DNR),
and a strategy of promoting solid tumor-infiltration (RT) of CAR T cells. The impact of our proposal extends
beyond MPM (>150,000/year pleural cancers in the U.S.); majority of aggressive solid tumors express MSLN.

Current approaches to small molecule drug discovery are slow, expensive, and prone to failure. The abundance
of data for structural biology has led to the emergence of a variety of computer-aided drug discovery
methodologies aiming to leverage this structural data to predict compound affinities to prioritize compounds
for synthesis in the pursuit of potency. Alchemical free energy methods, which use rigorous statistical
mechanics to predict the free energy of binding, have led the way in providing useful predictions for improving
or maintaining potency in hit-to-lead and lead optimization phases of structure-enabled programs. Numerous
offerings---such as Schrödinger FEP+, Orion NES, CCG AMBER-TI, and the Open Force Field Consortium have
emerged that provide engineered solutions with widespread industry adoption for structure-enabled discovery,
integrating advances from academia that my lab has been fortunate to contribute to over the last 15 years.
In contrast to physical methods such as alchemical free energy calculations, the emergence of machine learning
models based on deep learning architectures has provided a complementary tool for computer-aided drug
discovery. While physical models can generalize broadly across properties of interest for many target proteins,
they lack the ability to easily learn from data generated for a discovery program. Machine learning methods, on
the other hand, can readily learn from data, but often lack the ability to predict target-specific properties due to
their need for large training sets, generally limiting their utility to properties of relevance to drug discovery that
do not depend on the target, like ADMET properties.
This proposal builds on our highly successful work in alchemical free energy calculations by proposing a new
generation of hybrid physical / machine learning models that overcome the limitations of each method on its
own: By endowing alchemical free energy calculations with the ability to learn at multiple scales, we aim to
bring these tools into the next decade. Building on our extensive history of innovation in alchemical free energy
calculations for drug discovery, we will (1) significantly increase their accuracy via the integration of ML
potentials; (2) expand their domain of applicability beyond affinity to encompass conformational and target
selectivity, resistance, interactions with structurally-enabled toxicity targets, and physical properties like
membrane permeability, lipophilicity, and solubility; (3) eliminate accuracy-limiting challenges associated with
current calculations such as sampling of protonation and tautomeric states, structured waters, and ions; (4)
introduce learnability into every aspect of alchemical free energy calculations to enable predictions to become
systematically more accurate as project data is collected and greatly reduce the cost of evaluating very large
virtual synthetic spaces with alchemical-like accuracy; and (5) cast alchemical predictions in a Bayesian
framework to enable the propagation of uncertainties in the underlying models into predicted affinities,
selectivities, and other properties.

Single cell sequencing technologies have rapidly advanced over the past five years and have become
essential tools in a broad array of fields, ranging from developmental biology to human genetics. One major
advance was the development of high-throughput barcoding of RNA or DNA within droplets, which allowed for
preparation of sequencing libraries as a pool rather than in a laborious 96 well plate format. This advance
enabled sequencing analysis of thousands of cells in one batch. However, there has not been the same
breakthrough in scale when sequencing both DNA and RNA from the same cell as established techniques
involve sorting cells into plates or wells and ultimately separating DNA and RNA before library preparation. The
separation of RNA from DNA is necessary because conventional PCR amplification requires a 95oC melting
step, which degrades RNA. In this proposal, we will seek to optimize DNA amplification through recombination
polymerase amplification (RPA), an isothermal form of PCR which can be performed simultaneously with
reverse transcription of mRNA into cDNA. In this way, both RNA and DNA can be captured into barcoded,
sequencing libraries within the same droplet. The technology could have impact in many different fields in
which genotype-phenotype correlation is needed, such as characterizing genetic polymorphisms or genetic
variants in cancer. In SA1, we will demonstrate proof-of-principle of same cell DNA amplicon and RNA
transcriptome technology via isothermal RPA and reverse transcription. In SA2, we will determine the
quantitative performance of the methodology in two use applications and test capability to genotype
heterozygous alleles. If successful, this methodology could be widely adopted by laboratories in diverse fields
to answer questions related to genotype-phenotype correlations.

Sepsis is a life-threatening medical condition characterized by high levels of inflammatory markers
and multi-organ damage. Despite standard treatment, sepsis remains a leading cause of morbidity
and mortality in critically ill patients, especially cancer patients. Recently, it has been shown that
acupuncture can induce dopamine production, suppress inflammation, and reduce sepsis in animal
studies. Several randomized controlled clinical trials have shown that acupuncture may reduce
mortality in sepsis patients. However the trials were unblinded and at risk for bias. Here we propose
to fill the knowledge gap by conducting a randomized controlled, patient and evaluator blinded, phase
2 trial of acupuncture (the ACTIONS trial), using sham acupuncture as control, in patients at risk for
sepsis. The specific Aims are: 1) to generate preliminary data for the estimated effect size of
acupuncture in reducing mortality and ICU (Intensive Care Unit) admission of sepsis patients and to
determine the feasibility of conducting a randomized controlled trial of acupuncture in hospitalized
patients who are at risk for sepsis; and 2) to explore whether acupuncture increases catecholamines
and reduces inflammatory cytokines more than sham acupuncture. Seventy-eight patients at risk for
sepsis, will be randomized to true or sham acupuncture daily for 10 days or until transfer to ICU,
death, or discharge. Feasibility endpoints include as accrual rate, intervention delivery rate, attrition
rate, and data completion rate. Efficacy endpoints include mortality and rate of ICU admission.
Biomarker endpoints are plasma levels of catecholamines and pro-inflammatory cytokines, measured
before and after the first acupuncture treatment. If this study shows that acupuncture is deemed
feasible and the estimated effect size warrant a larger study, we plan to conduct a randomized
controlled phase 3 study evaluate the definitive efficacy of acupuncture in improving outcomes of
sepsis patients. The proposed study would be the first one acupuncture study on sepsis using sham
acupuncture as control. The data will also shed light on the mechanism of action of acupuncture. This
project has the potential of developing acupuncture as an innovative clinical approach in the
management of sepsis. It challenges the current clinical practice paradigm and can lead to reduction
of deaths due to sepsis.

Three-dimensional (3D) brain organoids from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) provide a tremendous
opportunity to model brain development and disease. Over the last few years, we have developed many hPSC-based
protocols that now enable researchers to routinely generate > 50 distinct human cell types for modeling both Central
Nervous System and Peripheral Nervous System disorders in a dish. More recently, our lab and others have
translated those 2D approaches into 3D “guided” neural organoid protocols to generate specific regions of the
human brain. Further complexity can be achieved by combining individual organoids into multi-region assembloids,
or by spatially restricted patterning to induce distinct human brain regions within a single organoid. However,
currently available organoid and assembloid models have major limitations, including a poor representation of
several progenitor and neuronal cell populations such as outer radial glia (oRG) and several cortical interneuron
lineages. We posit that the missing or underrepresented cell types may depend on signals provided by non-neural
lineages (vascular and immune cells). In our preliminary work, we have developed an improved hPSC-based
cortical organoid model which dramatically enhances the generation of oRG, cortical-derived interneurons, and
cortical excitatory neurons with increased levels of maturity. This was achieved by treatment with leukemia inhibitor
factor (LIF) resulting in the activation of STAT3 and mTOR signaling pathways. Data from human fetal cortex
development identifies vascular pericytes are a major source of LIF. Remarkably, we demonstrate that integrating
hPSC-derived brain pericytes can substitute for LIF treatment in cortical organoids.
Here, in Aim 1 we will optimize and assess robustness of the LIF organoid protocol and the generation of oRG
across multiple human PSC lines. We will further assess whether oRG give rise to intermediate progenitors, cortical
interneurons and cortical excitatory neurons using a unique oRG-specific double reporter hPSC line and genetic
fate mapping tools. Finally, we will determine how changes in mTOR signaling impact oRG behavior and whether
phenotypes observed in models of Tuberous Sclerosis (TSC) are linked to aberrant oRG function. In Aim 2, we will
build an organoid system that integrates key non-neural cell types. We will establish a modular platform that
combines cortical organoids with 3D spheroids (“microtissues”) comprised of vascular brain pericytes and/or
microglia. These novel microphysiological platform will be utilized to determine both LIF-dependent and LIF
independent effects on cortical development. Finally, we will assess whether such a more complex
microphysiological platform will enable improved modeling of the developmental defects related to mTOR signaling
and TSC.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Imaging plays an increasingly important role in studying development and complex tissue formation across
molecular, cellular and tissue levels. Fluorescence 3D time-lapse imaging allows every cell in a tissue or entire
organism to be imaged, tracked and measured over hours and days to analyze lineage differentiation and
dynamic cell behaviors. Other modalities, e.g., electron and expansion microscopy reveal fine structural
phenomena, while emerging genomics technologies, e.g., spatial transcriptomics, seek to merge with
microscopy to further provide systematic molecular information. Effective tools of image analysis are crucial to
extract, integrate and interpret the information. We propose to leverage the power of deep learning to develop
image analysis tools for systematic in vivo single-cell analysis, and to leverage such analysis to study collective
cell behaviors in tissue morphogenesis, with three Aims. First, we will develop deep learning methods for
accurate cell tracking, which is the essential first step to trace cell lineages and measure dynamic cell
behaviors. We aim to produce a tool that can deliver substantial cell lineages with hundreds to thousands of
cells imaged over hours to days in a wide range of model organisms and organoid cultures. Second, we will
automate landmark-based image registration, which is crucial for cross-modality data integration. We propose
a generalizable approach that uses statistical templates and Neural Networks to address the unique challenge
in developmental images, namely heterochrony of developmental processes that creates combinatorial
configurations of landmarks and complex systematic co-variance. Third, we study a novel Planar Cell Polarity
(PCP) scheme in C. elegans, which we discovered through cell tracking and deep learning of cell movement
patterns. By dissecting the compound polarity scheme and context specific regulators, we aim to understand
how the conserved core PCP pathway can coordinate with different polarity pathways in order to orchestrate
diverse motile behaviors in diverse developmental processes. By integrating technology development and
hypothesis driven research, our proposal will further our understanding of embryogenesis and complex tissue
formation.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
 The maintenance of genome stability across generations is critical for human health and relies on the
efficient repair of spontaneous DNA lesions and the faithful duplication of all chromosomal DNA prior to cell
division. The highly conserved DNA sliding clamps PCNA and 9-1-1 are critical for these genome maintenance
mechanisms in eukaryotic cells by acting as mobile hubs for the assembly of the protein complexes mediating
the signaling and repair of DNA damage and conducting the faithful replication of the nuclear chromosomes.
The dynamic association of PCNA and 9-1-1 with chromosomal DNA is controlled by a set of four conserved
and related ATP-dependent clamp loader complexes that each perform non-redundant genome maintenance
functions in the cell. How eukaryotic clamp loaders target their client clamps to sites of DNA replication and
repair and load the clamps around DNA has been the subject of intense investigation for several decades.
Using advanced biochemical reconstitution approaches and cryogenic electron-microscopy (cryo-EM), we
have recently determined the first structures of active eukaryotic clamp loader:clamp:DNA complexes, which
revealed the molecular basis for the substrate specificities of the yeast RFC and Rad24-RFC complexes and
resulted in a significant revision of current clamp loading models. Building on this work, here we propose to
extend and advance the approaches established by us for the yeast RFC:PCNA and Rad24-RFC:9-1-1 clamp
loader systems to characterize the molecular mechanisms of the yeast and human orthologues of Ctf18-
RFC:PCNA, Elg1ATAD5-RFC:PCNA, and RAD17-RFC:9-1-1. The innovative approach leverages the expertise
of Dr. Remus’ laboratory in the biochemical reconstitution of eukaryotic DNA replication and the expertise of
Dr. Hite’s laboratory in the characterization of the conformational landscapes of protein complexes by cryo-EM.
The proposed studies will determine the mechanistic basis for the functional specialization of CTF18-RFC
(Aim 1), uncover the currently unknown mechanism of PCNA unloading by Elg1ATAD5-RFC:PCNA (Aim 2) and
visualize the spectrum of conformational states of the human RAD17-RFC:9-1-1 complex to reveal the
evolutionary conservation or divergence of the 9-1-1 checkpoint clamp loading mechanism (Aim 3).
Collectively, this work will provide novel mechanistic insight into fundamental genome maintenance pathways.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) enzymes are hallmarks of a variety of deadly cancers, including
acute myeloid leukemia (AML), glioma, cholangiocarcinoma, chondrosarcoma, and T cell lymphoma. Mutant
IDH enzymes drive cancer through an unusual mechanism – they produce a metabolite called 2-
hydroxyglutarate (2HG) that poisons gene expression machinery and locks malignant cells in a stem cell-like
state. Drugs that inhibit mutant IDH enzymes induce durable clinical responses in some patients with IDH-
mutant cancers, leading to FDA approvals for AML and cholangiocarcinoma. However, despite near universal
inhibition of 2HG production, over half of patients do not respond to IDH inhibitors. Even for patients who
initially respond to IDH inhibitors, most eventually acquire resistance to the drugs. While the mechanisms of
resistance to IDH inhibitors remain incompletely understood, emerging evidence suggests that acquisition of
specific co-occurring mutations during tumor evolution results in a loss of dependence on 2HG. Therefore, we
need new treatment approaches that target IDH mutations in different ways beyond simple inhibition of
the enzyme. We previously identified an unusual pattern of resistance mutations in the dimer interface of
mitochondrial IDH2 wherein they occur in trans (on the other allele) relative to the 2HG-producing active-site
mutation. Here, we show that in contrast to the in trans mutations that drive drug resistance, forced expression
of a dimer-interface mutation in cis with the active-site mutation resulted in mitochondrial dysfunction and
impaired growth of leukemia cells. Biochemical and structural studies demonstrated that the in cis dimer-
interface mutation enabled IDH2 to aberrantly use NADH as an additional cofactor and dramatically enhanced
production of 2HG. Seeking to exploit the toxicity exerted by the in cis dimer-interface mutation, we performed
a chemical screen and identified small molecules capable of mimicking this aberrant enzymatic activity with
selective toxicity towards IDH2-mutant leukemia cells. Thus, we hypothesize that hyperactivation (rather
than inhibition) of mutant IDH offers an unexpected and effective new strategy to target IDH-mutant
cancers. This hypothesis will be rigorously tested in three Specific Aims. Aim 1 will use enzyme assays and
structural approaches to elucidate the biochemical basis for mutant IDH2 hyperactivation. Aim 2 will employ in
vitro and in vivo cancer models to define the mechanisms of toxicity arising from hyperactivation of mutant
IDH2. Aim 3 will utilize biochemical and functional approaches to determine if the approach of hyperactivation
can applied to cytosolic IDH1 mutations. The proposed studies will reshape our understanding of the
oncogenic properties of 2HG and the biochemistry of neomorphic IDH activation. More fundamentally, this
work will demonstrate the feasibility of an entirely novel hyperactivation approach as a strategy to harness
oncogene-mediated toxicity that could be applied to a wide range of oncogenes and cancer contexts.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Current standard tri-modality therapy (chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery) for locally advanced rectal cancer
is associated with high morbidity and only cures disease in about 75% of patients. We hypothesize that a
biomarker-driven approach that gives matched targeted therapy to patients early in the treatment of locally
advanced rectal cancers will lead to high anti-tumor activity and provide the chance to avoid radiation and/or
surgery and its associated morbidities. We have already pioneered such an approach for mismatch repair
deficient locally advanced rectal cancer, where clinical complete response was seen in all patients who
completed 6 months of upfront treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors (23/23, 100% complete clinical
response), allowing for the omission of radiation and/or surgery. In this proposal, we focus on patients with
HER2-amplified rectal cancer and hypothesize that induction therapy with HER2-targeted treatment will lead to
tumor regression and modify the need for tri-modality therapy. We propose an investigator-initiated phase II
study (NCT05672524; MSK IRB# 22-185) that recently opened to enrollment; all patients will receive tucatinib
plus trastuzumab induction HER2-targeted therapy for 6 weeks and continue tucatinib plus trastuzumab with
addition of standard-of-care chemotherapy for 4 months, followed by disease reassessment before standard
chemoradiation and before surgery. Patients with clinical complete response to induction HER2 therapy alone
or combined with chemotherapy, or to the combination followed by chemoradiation, will undergo observation
with a chance for an organ-sparing management approach. Our central hypothesis is that the primary tumor will
be highly sensitive to HER2-targeted therapy alone or in combination with standard chemotherapy, leading to a
higher frequency of clinical complete response than with standard total neoadjuvant therapy. Treatment of rectal
cancer in patients provides the unique opportunity to obtain on-treatment longitudinal tumor and blood samples
to evaluate mechanisms of response and resistance. We hypothesize that levels of HER2 expression and
consequent dependence on HER2 homodimers underlie drug response and will determine HER2 expression in
biopsy samples and with 89Zr-trastuzumab PET/MRI and correlate with response rate and progression-free
survival. Circulating tumor DNA will be tested as a biomarker for response. Established and newly generated
patient-derived HER2-amplified colorectal cancer organoids will be used to model and study acquired resistance,
taking advantage of our team's expertise in generating these three-dimensional, multi-cellular structures, which
both recapitulate the biology of rectal cancer and provide a needed resource that expands the limited HER2-
amplified rectal cancer models currently available. We hypothesize that key resistance mechanisms will consist
of decreased HER2 expression, secondary alterations that activate ERK, and shifts in tumor transcriptional
programs. Together, we will define the efficacy and biological effects of biomarker-directed therapy and aim to
transform treatment for patients with HER2-amplified locally advanced rectal cancer.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
In 2020, 53 million people in the U.S. served as family caregivers, the partners, relatives, and friends who
provide assistance (i.e., physical, emotional) to patients with often life-threatening, incurable illnesses.
Caregivers are increasingly tasked with responsibilities once performed by medical professionals, and the
availability and health of supportive caregivers is more critical than ever. A growing number of caregivers
provide care to patients with advanced, life-limiting cancers, and are tasked with critical patient care
responsibilities, and play a significant role in healthcare communication and advanced care planning as
healthcare proxies. The burden of these responsibilities is great and is driven largely by existential distress,
which contributes to anxiety, depression, poor quality of life, and mental health challenges in bereavement.
Concurrently, caregiving is an opportunity to experience a profound sense of meaning and purpose; caregiving
allows for the realization of new strengths and capacities, healing of relationships, and refinement of life goals.
When existential distress is addressed, caregivers can experience an enhanced sense of well-being despite
their challenges. While many interventions have been developed to support cancer caregivers, none directly
target existential distress. Our group adapted Meaning-Centered Psychotherapy (MCP), a highly effective
intervention in decreasing existential distress and enhancing well-being among patients with advanced cancer,
for cancer caregivers. Meaning-Centered Psychotherapy for Cancer Caregivers (MCP-C) is a stakeholder-
informed, innovative, manualized intervention designed to assist caregivers to connect to meaning and
purpose in life, despite the challenges of caregiving. Results of our pilot randomized controlled demonstrated
MCP-C’s feasibility, acceptability, and superiority in improving meaning, benefit-finding, depression, and
spiritual wellbeing. In the proposed trial, we will more rigorously evaluate the efficacy of MCP-C through a
randomized controlled trial of 200 caregivers of patients with advanced (Stage III/IV solid tumor) cancer who
will receive 7 sessions of MCP-C or Supportive Psychotherapy for Caregivers (SP-C), the standard of
community-based caregiver care. Participants will undergo assessments of meaning and spiritual wellbeing
(primary outcomes), and anxiety, depression, benefit finding, caregiver burden, and social support (secondary
outcomes) at baseline, post-treatment, and at 6- and 12-months follow-up. Bereavement outcomes including
pre- and post-loss grief, preparedness for loss, and regret will also be evaluated at each time point. We predict
MCP-C will result in greater improvements in primary and secondary outcomes, and that sense of meaning in
life will mediate treatment effects. We also predict that MCP-C will result in better preparedness for loss and
improved pre- and post-loss grief and regret. Our results will enhance our capacity to powerfully target
existential distress in caregivers of patients with advance cancer and by extension, improve their capacity to
provide critical care to patients at end-of-life.

Small-Molecule Penetration and Efflux in Gram-Negative Bacteria
Gram-negative bacterial infections are increasing in incidence and novel antibiotics are urgently needed to
combat this growing threat to public health. These pathogens have high intrinsic resistance to antibiotics due
to their combination of a two-membrane cell envelope, which presents a permeability barrier to small
molecules, and prevalent efflux pumps, which eject molecules that have successfully penetrated the barrier. A
major obstacle to the development of novel antibiotics is our poor understanding of the structural features of
small molecules that correlate with penetration and efflux across this barrier. As a result, large screening
campaigns of existing discovery libraries have mostly failed to provide new antibacterials. Similarly, while
potent biochemical inhibitors can often be identified for new targets, converting them into compounds with
whole-cell antibacterial activity has proven challenging.
To address this critical problem, we have developed a comprehensive experimental and computational
platform to evaluate and model Small-molecule Penetration and Efflux in Antibiotic-Resistant Gram-Negative
bacteria (SPEAR-GN, “speargun”). We have established all of the key enabling technologies required and
strong proof of concept for the effectiveness of this platform. We will now use our platform to assemble the
larger datasets required to train robust machine learning models of penetration and efflux that will be of broad
utility in antibacterial drug discovery. Herein, we will design and synthesize chemical libraries to map bacterial
penetration and efflux space, analyze compound accumulation in Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa,
and Acinetobacter baumannii using isogenic strain sets that decouple outer-membrane penetration from efflux,
evaluate the role of the BamA outer membrane protein in facilitated permeation of antibiotics, develop machine
learning models based on the assay data to predict compound accumulation, and use the models to design
and synthesize new molecules with improved accumulation in Gram-negative bacteria. Success in this project
will provide a major advance in the field of antibacterial drug discovery to address this major public health
threat.
This project will be carried out by an established multidisciplinary team with a proven track record in this field
and extensive combined expertise in library synthesis and medicinal chemistry, biochemistry and microbiology,
high-throughput assays and mass spectrometry, cheminformatics and machine learning, and antibacterial drug
discovery.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has led to significant advances in the study of brain structure and
function. In studies of auditory perception and speech-related functions, the earphones used to deliver
stimuli in an MR scanner must not contain ferrous or magnetic metals due to the scanner's immense
magnetic field strength. In addition, the strong magnetic gradients and radio frequency energy used during a
scan can induce electric currents even in non-ferrous metal components, which must be carefully designed
to prevent excessive heating. Finally, any metallic structures can interfere with the imaging process, leading
to artifacts in the image. New imaging protocols to improve spatial resolution and temporal sensitivity can
increase energy deposition and heating in materials with magnetic susceptibility that were unaffected under
older imaging protocols. While most of the world's MR scanners use magnetic field strengths of 3 Tesla (T)
or less, the demand for higher imaging resolution drives demand for scanners with greater field strength,
making them a fast-growing sector of the scanner market. Increasingly, research centers are installing
human MR systems capable of static field strengths of 7T or higher, with about 100 such scanners installed
worldwide; a handful of 9T scanners are already in operation, and a massive 11.7T human system is online
at the Neurospin facility in France. For animal research, small-bore scanners with ultra-high fields are in
use. The growing presence of ultra-high field systems will require earphones that can provide research-
grade auditory stimuli without compromising safety or introducing image distortions. There is no
commercially available audio driver that is free of metallic components. Even our company's current
earbuds—mostly used in 1.5T and 3T scanners—include some (non-ferrous) metallic components as
mechanical sound amplifiers and electrical conductors. Successive generations of earbud models have
progressively reduced metallic components to minimize imaging artifacts and heating, but this iterative
material reduction is no longer sufficient. Instead, a fundamentally new approach is required—we propose
to build earbuds entirely free of metallic components. For this, we will develop a novel audio driver that
does not require metal parts to deliver research-quality audio stimuli. The design will then be tested in 7T
and 11.7T scanners.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) is an epidemic. An estimated 34 million people in the US have T2DM and 84 million
have pre-diabetes - nearly half of whom are adults 65+ yo, putting many older adults at higher risk of unhealthy
aging and cognitive decline. A healthy lifestyle can treat and even reverse T2DM. But making lifestyle changes
is hard and many people fail, contributing to $327B in US healthcare costs. Diabetes group visits (DGV) and
diabetes self- management education and support (DSME/S) help people with T2DM to learn and sustain
complex disease management skills. Yet, access to DSME/S is limited such participation in DSME/S programs
is reportedly as low as 7% among adults with T2DM. New technologies supporting DSME/S programs are
emerging, but most fail to meet the unique needs of older adults with limited technology fluency, creating a new
digital divide. See Yourself Health (SYH) aims to bridge this digital health gap for older adults with a newly
designed immersive learning and telehealth application – the HOPE App – designed to deliver high-impact, high
engagement diabetes care and DSME/S tailored for older adults with diabetes.
Advancements in virtual reality software, new cloud gaming technology and user interface design have enabled
our team to envision a new telehealth and immersive learning environment to support chronic disease self-
management needs of older adults with diabetes. We use virtual reality, telecommunication technology and
social gaming strategies to offer real-time peer support, care coaching, and 28 modules of live-action experiential
learning programs to help participants master complex diabetes self-management skills. In our Phase I SBIR
project, we reached the following milestones: prototyped the HOPE App platform with cloud access and new
navigation and communication features; completed usability testing (SUS = 71) with 20 target users and
feasibility testing (100% participation) of the HOPE App platform; developed new DSME content for older adults.
In Phase II, we will further develop the HOPE App patient engagement and population health management
features and capabilities and then assess its efficacy in a fully powered clinical trial. Specific Aim 1: Develop the
HOPE App’s state-of-the-art immersive patient engagement experience with automated onboarding, social
networking and gamified DSME/S features to support long-term patient retention. Specific Aim 2: Develop the
HOPE App’s predictive analytic capabilities for population health management. Specific Aim 3: Clinical validation
of the HOPE App intervention on six-month clinical outcomes (A1c), patient reported outcomes (diabetes
distress) and engagement (patient retention, adherence to DSME/S). SYH has assembled an expert business
team to sell the HOPE APP to our target customer, health care payors. The HOPE APP offers a simple, high-
impact, highly engaging, immersive telehealth experience with the potential to become a ubiquitous diabetes
management tool to transform diabetes patients into high performing drivers of their own care.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：The type II transmembrane protein Fas ligand (Fasl) was first identified as a death receptor ligand that induced
Fas+ target cells to undergo apoptosis. As such, its constitutive expression in the eye has historically been linked
to the phenomenon of immune privilege and its ability to kill activated eye-infiltrating Fas+ effector cells, or eye-infiltrating
Fas+ vascular endothelial cells. However, this notion is confounded by the fact that many non-hematopoietic
cell types in the eye, including retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), constitutively express Fas. In fact,
Fasl-mediated destruction of RGCs is a key factor in glaucoma pathogenesis, either by direct killing of RGCs
and/or by inducing the production of proinflammatory chemokines by Fas+ glial cells (eg. astrocytes), that recruit
proinflammatory cells to the retina and thereby causing neurotoxic inflammation. This apparent conundrum can
be explained if one accepts our hypothesis that constitutive metalloproteinase-mediated cleavage of
membraned-bound Fasl (mFasL), releases a soluble fragment (sFasL) that opposes the neurotoxic activity of
mFasL. This premise is supported by preliminary data showing: (a) mice with a gene-targeted mutation of Fasl
that eliminates this Fasl cleavage site (mFaslmice) develop accelerated glaucoma in spontaneous and
inducible glaucoma models; {b} in healthy eyes, retinal Fasl is constitutively cleaved, but in glaucomatous eyes,
retinal Fasl is membrane-bound; and (c) intravitreal injection of an AAV2-sFasL vector prior to disease onset
can prevent the development of glaucoma, while injection of AAV2-sFasL after disease onset can reverse
functional defects. Together, these data point to Fasl as an important therapeutic target for patients with
glaucoma. However, a number of key questions remain unanswered and will be addressed by the proposed 3
specific aims: (Aim 1) When and how is Fasl cleavage suppressed during the development and progression of
glaucoma and how do ADAM10 and TIMP1 in regulate Fasl cleavage ?; (Aim 2) To what extent does the direct
engagement of Fas, expressed by astrocytes and/or RGCs, contribute to the development of glaucoma?; and
(Aim 3) Can sFasL directly engage Fas to elicit a protective gene expression program? Our research strategy
will involve both accepted and novel experimental tools, including (a) sortase-tagged-Fasl mice (provide by Dr.
Ploegh}, that will greatly facilitate our ability to monitor mFasL vs sFasL protein levels in the eye, {b} Fas-flexed
mice crossed to RGC- and astrocyte/muller-specific ere-deleter lines, that will allow us to identify the importance
of these cells in the development of glaucoma; (c) allophenic (tetraparental) chimeric mice made by fusing Fas+
and Fasn•9 embryos, that will allow us to distinguish direct and indirect effects of Fasl engagement in the context
of glaucoma, and {d} AAV2-sFasL vectors that will allow us to determine if sFasL functions independently of

the effective manipulation of Fas/Fasl interactions in patients afflicted with glaucoma and other ocular disorders.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Dry eye disease (DED) is a chronic immune-mediated disorder of the ocular surface, characterized by
disruption of the epithelial barrier and sustained ocular surface inflammation, which in severe cases results
in blindness from corneal ulceration and scarring. DED is arguably the most common ophthalmologic
condition for which patients visit eye care professionals, with more than 16 million US adults estimated to
have been diagnosed with DED (several folds higher than age-related macular degeneration). Notably, the
prevalence of DED increases with age. The financial burden of DED to the US healthcare system is vast,
with direct costs and expenses from productivity losses estimated to exceed $3.5 billion annually.
 The work of several laboratories, including the Principal Investigator's, has revealed key insights
concerning the immunopathogenesis of DED. There is now strong evidence that T helper-17 (Th17) cells
are critical promoters of immune-mediated damage to the ocular surface. The PI's laboratory has shown
that memory Th17 (mTh17) cells maintain disease chronicity, resulting in ocular surface epitheliopathy that
persists for many months after exposure to desiccating stress. Moreover, data from the PI's lab show that
regulatory T cells (Tregs) are defective in suppressing the Th17 response in DED. In addition, the PI's lab
has identified critical mechanisms controlling antigen-presenting cell (APC) activation and trafficking in
DED, as well as effector Th17 priming, expansion and homing. Despite substantial progress in unraveling
underlying immunopathogenic mechanisms, important questions remain unanswered.
 We hypothesize that (1) chronic DED is characterized by long-term impairment in the function of
regulatory T cells (Tregs) that normally maintain immune quiescence, and that (2) the aged are more
susceptible to DED due to a larger pool of memory Th17, whose function is inadequately regulated by aged
Tregs. The principal objectives of this project are to (i) precisely define the phenotypic changes that
characterize, and the mechanisms that promote long-term Treg dysfunction in DED; (ii) determine the
cellular precursors of mTh17 cells, as well as the cytokine mechanisms that influence the generation of
immunologic memory; and (iii) define the factors that amplify mTh17 immunity in aging. To achieve these
objectives, three specific aims have been defined to answer the following questions: Aim 1: What are the
causative mechanisms of enduring Treg dysfunction in DED? Aim 2: Which effector Th17 subsets are
predisposed to enter the memory pool (thus permitting DED chronicity), and what factors regulate this
process? And finally Aim 3: What are the cellular and molecular mechanisms that augment Th17-mediated
DED in aging? It is anticipated that this research will have significant translational impact given the high
prevalence of DED, the still limited knowledge we have regarding its immunopathogenesis, and the relative
scarcity of effective treatments.

the St. Regis Mohawk Tribe (SRMT) of Akwesasne, NY in partnership with the Roswell Park
Comprehensive Cancer Center (RP) led by the RP Center for Indigenous Cancer Research (RP-
CICR) in Buffalo, NY. Establishing the ARCH will support the development of two research
projects and one student enhancement project, all co-developed and co-led by SRMT and RP.
The proposed Administrative Core will establish key personnel, supplies, and in-person or virtual
meetings to coordinate project timelines, deliverables, evaluation efforts, and community
engagement. The Environmental Health Research Project will engage RP environmental
scientists and state-of-the-art equipment to measure environmental health concerns in
Akwesasne landscapes and their relationships to the human condition. The liver wellness project
titled, LIVE (Live, Indigenous, Virtual, Enhancement), includes a culturally tailored liver health
promotion program to encourage traditional and healthy life ways through community-based
education and lifestyle modification. To support research interest amongst the younger generation
in Akwesasne, the ARCH proposal includes the St. Regis Mohawk Research Scholars Program.
This program engages high school and college students in a three-prong approach, 1.)
Community Engagement Conferences to create research and science career awareness and
recruit students to participate in afterschool and summer research opportunities; 2.) An After
School Health Science Club to provide students with working knowledge of public health, data
collection methods, statistical analysis approaches, health behavior and epidemiology principles;
and 3.) a Summer Program to provide high school and college students with immersive research
experiences integrated with core research projects of ARCH, and to apply principles and skill sets
to addressing cancer health disparities and environmental health issues specific to the SRMT.
Each project in the ARCH would be directed by the Principal Investigator from the SRMT Health
Division and coordinated by key personnel identified both at SRMT and RP's Center for
Indigenous Cancer Research. This direct partnership with the SRMT Health Division supports
RP's existing Memorandum of Understanding with the Indian Health Service that agrees to
collaborate in the areas of cancer research; research; consultation/technical assistance focused
on cancer prevention; capacity building; and direct services in partnership with American Indian
and Alaska Native communities. The SRMT will activate this MoU to further guide the
development of the ARCH.

An estimated 3 million people are affected by glaucoma in the United States, and increasing life expectancy
exacerbates the disease’s socio-economic impact. Glaucoma and other optic neuropathies lead to permanent
damage of the optic nerve and loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). No therapies are currently available to
mitigate irreversible vision loss. The feasibility of cell replacement therapy was recently demonstrated using
RGCs isolated from a developing retina. Furthermore, we have shown that it is possible to achieve robust and
reproducible transplants with stem cell-derived RGCs. While our donor RGCs survived in host retinas following
transplantation, cell survival does not equate to the restoration of vision, and poor structural and functional
integration remains a significant challenge for successful RGC replacement.
One of the key molecular features limiting donor RGC integration into the existing circuitry is likely to be the
vestigial homophilic molecular cues that guide somatic spacing and dendritic arborization during development.
Down Syndrome Cell Adhesion Molecule (DSCAM) has been identified as a key molecular cue that mediates
neuronal self-avoidance to prevent fasciculation and preserve mosaic spacing in the retina during development.
We hypothesize that these same mechanisms govern the integration of transplanted RGCs and that
homophilic molecular cues, including DSCAM, limit donor RGC migration towards their natural
connecting points within the retina. Therefore, this proposal aims to investigate DSCAM in the context of RGC
transplantation to understand how self-avoidance mechanisms contribute to neural circuit development and
repair.
Using RGC transplantation into the retina as a model system, we will determine if DSCAM-mediated self-
avoidance mechanisms are dose-mediated, rely on transcellular interactions, and function similarly irrespective
of neural migration. To investigate the need for transcellular DSCAM expression for RGC self-avoidance, we will
conduct a series of transplantation experiments using gain- and lose-of-function (GOF and LOF) mice.
Expression of DSCAM by mouse stem cell-derived RGC will be suppressed with siRNA before intravitreal
injections. Similarly, to investigate if DSCAM regulates donor RGC spacing independent of the mode of
migration, we will suppress DSCAM in host and donor RGCs while temporarily destabilizing the donor RGC’s
cytoskeleton to alter their migratory modality between somal translocation and multipolar migration. Live imaging
and quantitative immunohistochemistry will be used to assess donor cell morphology and distribution in the
retina. Anterograde tracing and retinal explants cultured on multielectrode arrays will be used to evaluate
synapse formation with host bipolar cells. Altogether, this mechanistic approach would significantly impact the
development of cell replacement therapy for glaucoma and other neurodegenerative diseases.

Notch 3 mutations are the cause of cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts
and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL), a small vessel disease characterized by stroke and vascular
cognitive impairment. Transgenic mouse studies from our lab and others have shown that Notch 3 sig-
naling is critical for mural cell survival, and blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity, and that Notch 3 knock-
out mice have increased susceptibility to hypoxia-induced stroke. Loss of mural cells (MCs), including
pericytes and vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs), in the small penetrating arteries of the brain is a
hallmark of CADASIL and a major contributor to vascular dysfunction. Importantly, in both humans and
mouse models, loss-of-function (LOF) Notch 3 mutations cause MC death. Currently, there are no tar-
geted therapies available for CADASIL. We have also shown that antibodies can be used to modulate
Notch 3 signaling in mouse models of CADASIL. Specifically, we showed that a mouse monoclonal an-
tibody administered in a CADASIL mouse model can prevent MC loss. Our proposal will optimize a mo-
dality of treatment for CADASIL by humanizing a mouse monoclonal Notch 3 agonist antibody. Our pro-
ject goals are as follows. Aim 1. To generate a panel of agonist Notch3 human monoclonal antibodies
(humAbs). We propose to humanize a mouse monoclonal antibody capable of activating human Notch
3, via grafting of complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) into human framework regions (FRs).
Aim 2. To rank order the candidate antibodies using in vitro assays. We will screen candidate human-
ized antibodies for the preservation of specific Notch 3 antigen recognition using a sensitive in vitro
ELISA test detecting target engagement and activation of human Notch3 receptors via release of the
Notch 3 extracellular domain (N3ECD) biomarker. Aim 3. Prepare cell line for the production of lead
humAb. We will produce at least two humanized A13 (huA13) for preclinical in vivo testing by generat-
ing a cell line using Switchable Membrane Reporter (SwiMR) technology for antibody production. Aim
4. To test the preclinical efficacy of lead Notch 3 humAbs in mouse models of Notch 3 deficiency and
CADASIL. We will screen our humanized antibody candidates for biologic effects including Notch 3 acti-
vation in CNS vessels, crossing the blood-CNS barrier, normalization of N3ECD in blood, a target en-
gagement biomarker linked to Notch3 signaling in vivo, and rescue of mural cell loss. Aim 5. To evalu-
ate toxicity and pharmacokinetics. We will examine toxicity and pharmacokinetics antibody administra-
tion of increasing single-dose in mice.

The goal of the NIMH Repository and Genomics Resource (NRGR) is to further the understanding of the
genetic and environmental etiologies of mental disorders. The NRGR receives raw biosamples, such as blood,
from NIMH-supported research projects. The NRGR processes these samples to DNA, RNA, cDNA, or cell
lines, which can then be used for genomic analyses. The NRGR also receives, curates, and harmonizes
clinical/phenotypic data for each subject. Results of genomic analyses on samples in the NRGR are either
directly deposited in the NRGR or are linked to a deposit in another public repository. After a proprietary
period, the clinical data, genomic data, DNA, RNA, cDNA, and cell lines are made available to all NIMH-
approved researchers through a secure web portal. This sharing of uniformly processed biological samples
and curated clinical and genomic data from many cohorts leverages the NIMH investment in genetic studies. It
provides critical research power by making a very large body of data available for study of the genetic bases
for individual mental disorders. Since October 1998, >250K subject samples have been submitted to NRGR
and >615K DNA and >15K cell lines have been distributed. There have been >1,700 distributions of clinical
and genomic data to >1,000 investigators, resulting in >1,000 publications using NRGR samples and data.
Starting in 2011, the NRGR has provided in-depth characterization services for induced pluripotent stem cells
(iPSC) and their progenitor somatic cells, as well as limited iPSC production. As its guiding aim, the NRGR will
continue to innovate in order to serve the scientific needs of NIMH PIs in a flexible and highly accessible
manner, while respecting subject confidentiality, informed consent issues, and PI prerogatives.

The enjoyment of fat-rich foods has benefitted our species by providing necessary energy, as well as lipid
components that are crucial for growth and development. Thus, it is no surprise that fatty acid detection
components have been recently identified in taste tissue, likely evolved for the necessary intake of energy and
essential fatty acids. The endocannabinoid system (ECS) has recently been implicated in both the detection of
and reward conferred by fatty acids in fatty foods. These detection and reward systems serve to increase intake
of triglyceride-rich foods, which is evolutionarily advantageous. Today, an overabundance of LCFAs, especially
omega 6 and saturated fatty acids, are present in processed foods and snacks (doughnuts, ice cream, etc.),
adding to the growing global obesity phenomenon. In particular, the anabolic ECS that drives consumption by
strengthening fat intake reward is damaging health in the Western food environment. We presently seek to
understand how the endocannabinoid system impacts oral fatty acid detection and the hedonic evaluation of
fatty, palatable foods, as well as how these parameters are altered in obese individuals. These experiments will
allow us to understand how to develop therapeutic targets of the ECS in order to sensitize ‘fat taste’ and reduce
the desire for and consumption of fatty foods in obese individuals.

understanding, prevention and treatment of complex disorders such as cancer, diabetes,
substance abuse, etc., which are significantly on the rise. The promise of data science can be
fully realized only when collected data can be collaboratively shared and analyzed. However, the
widespread increases in healthcare data breaches due to inappropriate access as well as the
increasing number of novel privacy attacks restrict institutions from sharing data. Indeed, in some
cases, the results of the analysis can themselves lead to significant privacy harm. The success
of the data commons depends on ensuring the maximal access to data, subject to all of the patient
privacy requirements including those mandated by legislation, and all of the constraints of the
organization collecting the data itself. While there are existing solutions that can solve parts of the
problem, there are significant challenges in truly incorporating these into comprehensive working
solutions that are usable by the biomedical research community, and new challenges brought on
by modern techniques such as deep learning. The long-term goal of this research is to develop
technologies that can holistically enable data sharing while respecting privacy and security
considerations and to ensure that they are implemented in existing platforms that have
widespread acceptance in the research community. Towards this, the objective of this project is
to develop complementary solutions for risk inference, distributed learning, and access control
that can enable different modalities of data sharing. The problems studied are general in nature
and will evolve depending on research successes and new impediments that arise. The proposed
program of research is significant since lack of access to biomedical data can lead to
fragmentation of care, resulting in higher economic and social costs, and is a significant
impediment to biomedical research. The project will result in open-source, freely available
software tools that will be integrated into widely used data collection, cohort identification, and
distributed analytics platforms. There are several ongoing collaborations that will serve as initial
pilot customers to provide use cases, identify the requirements, evaluate results, and in general
validate the developed solutions.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Traumatic brain injury has many sequelae resulting from the initial injury that exacerbate neural
degeneration and functional deficits, which may emerge over long times following the initial
injury. While many studies have examined secondary neuronal loss in the penumbra of the
injury site that occurs due to the induction of inflammatory cytokines and an altered trophic
environment, the impact of these changes in the injured tissue on afferent axons that project to
the injury site from distal locations has not been investigated. In particular, basal forebrain
cholinergic neurons (BFCN) project throughout the cortex and hippocampus, and these neurons
are critical for numerous cognitive functions. These neurons express all the neurotrophin
receptors, the Trk family (TrkA, TrkB, and TrkC) which promote neuronal survival and axonal
growth, as well as p75NTR, which can promote neuronal death and axon degeneration.
Therefore, the consequence of altered levels of trophic factors in the target regions of these
neurons may critically impact the integrity of their axonal projections and ultimately have
negative consequences for the cognitive functions supported by these neurons. Using the fluid
percussion injury (FPI) model to induce moderate TBI in mice, we will investigate the immediate
and long-term consequences of cortical injury on the afferent basal forebrain neurons. Using
compartment culture strategies, we will investigate mechanisms of axonal signaling that mediate
retrograde degenerative responses. Understanding the full scope of damage that occurs as a
consequence of TBI is critical to developing therapeutic strategies to limit the negative
consequences of the injury.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Overview. Human fMRI and LFP recording studies suggest that the anterior insula encodes the salience of
stimuli and deviations from expectations. However, BOLD signals and LFPs have insufficient resolution to assess
how these codes are distributed across insular cells. Moreover, the origin and functional relevance of insular
codes is unclear. We will address these questions with multi-site single unit and LFP recordings as well as
optogenetic methods in rats. Critically, our pilot data indicates that presentation of salient stimuli elicits identical
LFP responses in rats and humans: bursts of high amplitude beta (13-30 Hz) oscillations.
Significance and approach. Because its volume is reduced in most psychiatric disorders, the insula is a
promising therapeutic target for transcranial or deep brain stimulation. However, progress in this field has been
hindered by a lack of high-resolution data about insula signaling. Thus, this proposal may facilitate the
development of novel therapies. To study the insula in rats, we developed a novel reinforcement learning task
that features a behavioral readout of the rats’ expectations (and their violations). This task will allow us to assess
how anterior insula neurons and their synaptic partners encode multiple variables and probe their role in learning.
Aim #1 Characterize the coding properties of neurons in the anterior insula and its synaptic partners.
We will perform multi-site unit and LFP recordings in the anterior insula and its synaptic partners. This will allow
us to: (1) test whether cells at these various sites encode outcome valence, magnitude, salience, and deviations
from expectations; (2) test whether valenced stimuli elicit bursts of beta oscillations in the anterior insula, as seen
in humans; (3) compare the entrainment of neurons at these various sites by oscillations of different frequencies;
(4) test whether the amplitude of insular beta bursts tracks stimulus salience and deviations from expectations.
Aim #2: Determine which inputs drive coding of different variables in anterior insula neurons. The data
obtained in Aim 1 will suggest which inputs convey information about different variables to insula neurons. Similar
hypotheses will arise regarding the origin and propagation of insular beta bursts. To test these hypotheses, we
will infuse AAVs driving the expression of an inhibitory opsin in projection-defined cell types. Then, we will inhibit
the candidate cell types and assess how these manipulations affect the coding properties of insula neurons as
well as the genesis and propagation of insular beta bursts.
Aim #3 Test whether reducing or enhancing insular beta bursts impairs or facilitates learning. We will
achieve real-time control over insular beta bursts by combining optogenetics with programmable multi-channel
signal processors, giving us unprecedented control over fast neuronal events. We will enhance or dampen
insular beta bursts by delivering low-intensity light stimuli that bias spike times in or out-of-phase with respect to
beta oscillations, without altering firing rates. If insular beta bursts facilitate learning, up- or down-regulating them
should respectively accelerate or slow down learning in the task.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
Even at the earliest cortical stages, visual processing is influenced by internally generated information. Top-
down influence on visual processing is found in very different behavioral contexts. As a result, early visual areas
are increasingly considered as “interfaces” or “blackboards” where bottom-up information is confronted to top-
down representations. Yet, our knowledge on the cellular and network mechanisms by which top-down signals
modulate the integrative properties of visual cortical neurons is still fragmentary. Moreover, the impact on visual
processing and visual perception of the relatively small top-down modulations that were described in early visual
cortices is debated. Finally, we ignore to what extent top-down modulation is flexible and can be adapted to a
novel behavioral goal. Our long-term goal is to better understand the functions and mechanisms of top-down
influences on early visual processing using a recent and tractable model: the modulation by sound of visual
processing in V1. We have recently shown that the representation of the orientation and direction of the visual
stimulus in V1 is improved in the audiovisual context, through a potentiation of the response of neurons with
preferred orientations matching the orientation of the visual cue, and a suppression of the activity of neurons
coding for orthogonal orientations and opposite directions. The overall objective of this application is to establish
the cellular and network mechanisms, functional impact and flexibility of sound modulation on early visual pro-
cessing. Our central hypotheses, based on our preliminary data, is that sound modulation in V1 results from the
activation of local mechanisms controlling the orientation and direction tuning of V1 neurons, that modest im-
provements of the representation of visual stimuli can improve visual perception, and that sound modulation in
V1 is flexible and can be adapted to novel behavioral goals by training. The rationale for the proposed research
is to better understand why, when and how internal representations bias sensory perception. To test our central
hypotheses, we propose the following specific aims: 1) Determine the cellular mechanisms underpinning the
orientation and direction-dependent sound modulation of V1 neurons by performing whole-cell recordings in
awake mice, a technique for which our laboratory has a unique expertise; Using two-photon calcium imaging in
mice performing Go/NoGo behavioral tasks, we will also 2) Determine the impact of sound modulation on the
representation of the visual stimulus in V1 and on visual perception; 3) Demonstrate that sound modulation is
flexible and can be adapted to a novel behavioral task though training. Our approach is innovative because we
will bring to the mouse a topic so far mostly addressed in primates to benefit from functional imaging, genetic
tools and our unique skill at performing whole-cell recordings in awake behaving mice. The proposed research
is significant because it is expected to vertically advance our understanding on how top-down inputs adapt visual
processing to the behavioral goal. Ultimately, such a knowledge will inform the pathophysiology of several de-
velopmental, and degenerative disorders in which top-down control of sensory processing is impaired.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Project Summary
Social isolation is associated with a host of negative outcomes including increased rates of depression and early
mortality. Critically, social isolation can lead to maladaptive choices such as substance use as a coping strategy
for negative affect. Importantly, perceived connection with others can ameliorate adverse consequences of
isolation, potentially mitigating maladaptive coping mechanisms (i.e., substance use). Indeed, close connections
with others satisfy basic needs of belongingness and are associated with enhancing the reward value of social
experiences as reflected in reward-related neural circuits. While evidence in rodents suggests that the potential
for social interaction decreases the likelihood of substance use, there remains a critical gap in treatment
approaches in enabling substance-dependent individuals to form healthy social connections. This is in large part
due to: 1) neurobiological models of substance abuse have yet to widely integrate social context; 2) dynamic
social interactions are difficult to study in laboratory settings; and 3) a current lack of mechanistic understanding
how social rewards facilitate the development of social bonds.
Our proposal aims to delineate the mechanisms underlying the formation of social bonds as a precursor to
understanding how they may help sway maladaptive behaviors. We suggest that a critical aspect to forming a
social connection is developing a shared interpretation of reality, in which individuals begin to share similar
perspectives and preferences. We test this idea across 3 aims by first characterizing the basic mechanisms
underlying social reward-seeking behaviors using ecologically-valid stimuli (e.g., posting personal photos on
social media). We then use a naturalistic paradigm to create shared affective experiences and examine the role
of communicating shared preferences in forming social bonds in Aim 2. Finally, we recognize that shared
preferences may also make it difficult for behavior to change if such preferences converge on maladaptive
behaviors such as nicotine use. We explore this idea in Aim 3 by examining mechanisms underlying social
reward-seeking in a nicotine-dependent population, while also considering how shared preferences may impact
behavior. Taken together, the proposed studies will use ecologically-valid stimuli and naturalistic paradigms to
delineate the mechanisms of how social rewards, which signal shared preferences, shape social reward-seeking
behaviors, facilitate social connection and may mitigate (or promote) cravings for substances in nicotine users.
Importantly, this work will lay the groundwork for future proposals to investigate the role of the dynamics of social
connection in substance abuse.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：The ongoing rapid and widespread transmission of SARS-CoV-2 across the world has resulted in myriad viral
strains, but human immunity has been acquired from vaccination against a single (Wuhan-Hu-1) strain and/or
previous infection with a handful of strains. The large number of substitutions present in the recently emerged
Omicron Variant of Concern (VOC) spike (S) protein's receptor-binding domain (RBD) – a key antigenic site –
are associated with immune evasion and a putative broadening of species tropism. Immune evasion may have
serious consequences, potentially leading to increased incidence of infection, reinfection and/or further
enhancing viral fitness during uncontrolled spread around the globe. Omicron has not directly descended from
any of the previously identified VOCs raising the specter of future, highly-substituted immune-evasive VOCs.
Prior knowledge of the space of potential variants may enable the development of active and passive
immunization strategies for blunting the damage caused by novel VOCs. However, the scientific community
currently lacks the tools to prospectively identify novel highly-substituted VOCs capable of immune evasion. In
Aim 1 we propose a pipeline for discovering a diverse set of heavily substituted and immune-evasive RBD
variants. Relatedly, the medical community lacks binding-based therapeutic passive immunization leads against
unknown future variants that can be deployed in the event of a novel VOC outbreak. For example, many
monoclonal antibody therapies that previously received emergency use authorization from FDA no longer
neutralize the Omicron VOC, leading to fewer clinically relevant pharmaceutical interventions. For Aim 2, we
propose to redesign existing small-protein-based therapeutic entities to bind nearly all possible prospectively
identified novel VOCs. Our proposal is enabled by results from the PI and co-I laboratories, in which we
developed high-throughput structure-based computational and experimental approaches for predicting and
characterizing the binding of diverse SARS-CoV-2 RBD variants with the ACE2 and a set of neutralizing
antibodies (nAbs) to effectively recapitulate variant S function and immune evasion properties. We will apply our
technologies to broadly sample heavily substituted (10-20 substitutions) but functional RBD variants and identify
those that are predicted to abrogate binding to a representative set of neutralizing antibodies raised against two
key (Class 1 and Class 2) epitope regions of the RBD. Experimentally validated classes of escape-competent
RBD variants will serve as targets for the design of small protein-based inhibitors. The overall impact of this
project will be the prospective identification of the space of possible variation in Class 1 and Class 2 epitopes
that can still be recognized by the prevalent immune response. This will aid therapeutic intervention and identify
candidate RBD variant immunogens for inclusion in next-generation vaccines. This project will also provide
potent inhibitors of the diverse highly substituted RBD variants. With further clinical development, these may
serve as off-the-shelf therapeutics for effectively stopping a new VOC in its tracks.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Intrathecal oxytocin (OT) is in clinical trials as an opioid alternative for chronic pain treatment. Our work in mice
suggests that coupling intrathecal oxytocin with manual therapies (i.e. massage) optimizes the analgesic
properties of oxytocin. This project provides the framework to support this combination therapy by concentrating
on the spinal cord circuit mechanisms by which oxytocin alleviates pain. Our preliminary studies suggest that
oxytocin-specific spinal cord circuits are embedded within a previously uncharacterized dorsal horn
nociceptive/affective touch circuit. We will carry out three complementary sets of experiments to test the overall
hypothesis that oxytocin alleviates pain by balancing excitation, inhibition, nociception, and affective touch to
sculpt the activity of spinal projections systems that carry both negative valences (associated with noxious
stimuli), and signals associated with positive valence (like the pleasurable properties of touch). Pharmacological
and behavioral studies in rodents suggest that spinal cord oxytocin receptors (OTRs) mediate intrathecal
oxytocin-induced analgesia. In Aim 1 we map the distribution of OTR+ interneurons within the dorsal horn of
female and male mice, rats, and humans. In Aim 2, we map the specific input/output profiles of OTR+INs. Here
we test the hypothesis that inhibitory and excitatory OTR+INs integrate peripheral nociceptive/affective touch
information with OT to differentially regulate the activity of molecularly defined Lamina I projection neurons. In
Aim 3 we assay the contribution of OT spinal cord circuits to both sensory-evoked reflexes and affective-
motivational pain. For Aim 3 we implement our recently developed computational approaches to scale sensory-
reflexive and affective-motivational pain. Results from our human tissue studies will inform how our
interpretations of our rodent studies may be applied to human therapies. Based on our unique expertise in touch-
specific spinal cord circuits, access to a large repertoire of spinal cord-specific tools, and behavior analytics that
match the granularity of our circuit dissection techniques, we are uniquely poised to provide the theoretical
framework for this combination therapy. In addition to informing context and condition for OT delivery, this work
may also be used in the clinic to adjust OT dosage and delivery method. This project is impactful for several
other reasons: 1) using computer vision/machine learning we will uncover the specific aspects of the pain
experience that are alleviated by spinal cord OT, and assess efficacy against other analgesics; 2) our
computational approaches to objectively scale rodent pain can be easily shared and implemented across
research groups, serving as a blueprint to standardize rodent pain assessment (see Resource Sharing); 3) our
general approach and model can serve as a basic blueprint for testing how other neuromodulators are
functionally integrated into spinal cord circuits of touch and nociception; and; 4) this type of foundational work
informs innovative approaches to disentangle the sensory from the emotional experiences of pain, inspiring new
therapies to treat each uniquely.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Down syndrome (DS), caused by triplication of human chromosome 21 (HSA21), is the most common genetic
origin of intellectual disability. Studying DS disease mechanism is challenging because functional human DS
brain tissues are scarcely available and transgenic mouse models of DS demonstrate incomplete/inaccurate
expression of HSA21 genes. The advent of human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) technology has led to
the generation of DS patient-derived hiPSCs, which presents an unprecedented opportunity for studying the
pathogenesis of DS with unlimited human brain cells in vitro. While using the hiPSC-based in vitro models, basic
aspects of the disease phenotypes can be examined, the disruption of neural circuits in the developing brain
under disease conditions remains to be studied with hiPSCs. Ultimately, specific developmental and disease
mechanisms can only be modeled in live animals to identify links between cellular phenotypes and behavioral
performance. Therefore, we propose to employ hiPSC-based chimeric mouse brain models to study the
neuropathophysiology of DS in vivo. Microglia play critical roles in brain development and are also an active
player in learning and memory processes. Surprisingly, very little information is available on how trisomy of
HSA21 alters the development and functions of microglia and what roles microglia play in the abnormal brain
development and cognitive deficits in DS. In addition, mounting evidence indicates that rodent microglia are not
able to fully mirror the properties of human microglia in normal and disease conditions. In this study, we will use
our recently created hiPSC microglial chimeric mouse model to unravel the role of microglia in DS pathogenesis
in an in vivo system with intact neural networks. We hypothesize that unlike engrafted normal human microglia,
engrafted diseased DS human microglia will show abnormal biological properties and functions, such as synaptic
pruning function in vivo. These abnormal properties of DS microglia will result in their negative regulation of the
synaptic activity and plasticity of the hippocampal neural network, critically contributing to the cognitive deficits
seen in DS. This hypothesis will be tested in three specific aims. Aim 1: we will determine the differences between
DS and control hiPSC-derived microglia in vivo in human microglial chimeric mouse brains. Aim 2: Using the
microglial chimeric mouse model, we will further examine the impact of integration of DS microglia on synaptic
plasticity of the hippocampus and learning and memory behavior of the animals. Aim 3: We will normalize the
expression of the HSA21 genes by CRISPR/Cas9 to examine how this will alter the properties of DS microglia.
Moreover, single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis of hiPSC microglial chimeric mouse brains will be performed to
compare gene expression profiles of control and DS microglia. Findings from our study using a powerful, new
hiPSC microglial chimeric mouse model will provide novel insights into the pathological roles of human microglia
in DS. Identifying the potential molecules that can be targeted to improve microglial function may provide a new
therapeutic avenue for the treatment of DS.

 Astrocytes are versatile glial cells that regulate diverse processes in the central nervous system (CNS).
Roles for astrocytes during disease are complex and include both protective and pathologic functions. Recently,
distinct astrocyte activation states have been described, though the molecular mechanisms that govern astrocyte
polarization during neurotropic viral infection are not well understood. Here, we propose that receptor-interacting
protein kinase-3 (RIPK3) is a previously unappreciated driver of inflammatory astrocyte activation during viral
infection of the CNS. While roles for RIPK3 in programmed cell death have been extensively characterized, our
published work has described pleiotropic, cell death-independent functions for this pathway in the coordination
of protective neuroinflammation during viral encephalitis. In preliminary studies, we now show that RIPK3
signaling in astrocytes is required for survival and virologic control following challenge with Zika virus, an
emerging neurotropic pathogen of global concern. Using a combination of novel mouse genetic tools, we will
elucidate roles for RIPK3 signaling in astrocytes by 1) Defining profiles of expression, activation, and antiviral
function for astrocytic RIPK3; 2) Determining roles for astrocytic RIPK3 signaling in coordinating
neuroinflammation; and 3) Defining key substrates and transcriptional outputs of RIPK3 signaling in astrocytes.
Together, our studies promise to identify new molecular mechanisms governing protective neuroimmune function
during viral encephalitis.

Our current understanding of chromatin transcription has been limited by our knowledge of the factors that are
involved in this process. In this regard, we have identified a novel nucleosome destabilization factor, termed
NDF, that can destabilize nucleosomes and facilitate transcription elongation through nucleosomes. In this
proposal, we will investigate the function of NDF in chromatin dynamics and RNA Polymerase II transcription
elongation using biochemistry, genomics, bioinformatics and structural biology approaches. In Specific Aim 1,
we will develop and employ new methods and strategies to study the molecular mechanism of NDF-mediated
nucleosome destabilization and RNA Polymerase II transcription. We will use ultra-high-resolution optical
tweezer as well as cryo-electron microscopy to characterize the dynamics of NDF-mediated nucleosome
destabilization. In Specific Aim 2, we will examine how NDF is recruited to the transcribed regions of active
genes in cells. We will assess whether other cellular factors, other than H3K36me3 histones, contribute to the
recruitment of NDF. In Specific Aim 3, we will determine how genes lacking NDF are transcribed, and
investigate protein factors that are related to NDF. The studies proposed here should significantly increase our
understanding of the mechanisms of Pol II transcription elongation through chromatin.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
Harboring active transposable elements (TEs) imposes a substantial mutational burden on the host genome. To
reduce this burden, most organisms have evolved sophisticated, and often multi-layered, mechanisms for
identifying and inactivating TEs. In spite of these defenses, active TEs are found in the genomes of almost all
eukaryotes. One explanation for the evolutionary persistence of TEs is that they are in an “arms race” with their
host genome: TEs are constantly evolving novels ways to block or evade host silencing while the host genome
is continuously evolving to re-establish TE suppression. While this theory is appealing, there is a gap in
knowledge because the mechanisms by which TEs could block or evade host defenses are largely unknown.
The long-term goal of this applicant’s laboratory is to understand the evolutionary dynamics of TE/host co-
evolution. The overall objective of this project is to understand and functionally validate a novel TE strategy,
discovered in the applicant’s laboratory, that involves TEs using their own piRNAs to target host silencing factors
for suppression. Preliminary data produced in the applicant’s laboratory suggests that the Drosophila
melanogaster telomeric transposon TART-A captured a portion of the host TE silencing factor nxf2, which allows
TART-A to produce piRNAs targeting nxf2 for suppression. The rationale for the proposed research is that it will
provide critical insight into the mechanisms of host-TE conflict and how TE counter-defense strategies can
impact host gene expression and fitness. The objective of this project will be achieved by pursuing three specific
aims: 1) Identify genes acquired by telomeric TEs across Drosophila; 2) Determine whether non-telomeric
transposons also use a piRNA-mediated counter-silencing strategy; and 3) Disrupt TE counter-silencing using
CRISPR in D. melanogaster. Telomeric TEs will be identified in 28 species of Drosophila and assayed to
determine whether they have acquired host gene fragments. The applicant’s laboratory has identified 45
candidate genes in D. melanogaster that share homology with TE-derived piRNAs and are known to play a role
in TE suppression. These genes will be tested to determine if they suppress the same TE with which they share
homology. Candidate TE/gene pairs will be validated using CRISPR genome editing to erase their shared
homology, which should result in upregulation of the gene in question. The proposed research is innovative
because it represents a substantial departure from the status quo: instead of the host-centric view of previous
studies, which examine how the genome responds to TE activity, this project will study the TE side of the equation
by investigating how TEs respond to and counteract host defenses. One of the major goals of the field is to
understand why host genes involved in TE silencing are rapidly evolving. The proposed research is significant
because it will support this goal by characterizing and functionally validating a specific TE counter-defense
strategy, which will provide empirical support for the arms race theory, while also increasing understanding of
the co-evolutionary dynamics between host genomes and their TE associates.

loci are present in almost all archaea and half of eubacteria. They protect prokaryotes from foreign
genetic elements. While highly diverse, all CRISPR-Cas systems function through three common steps:
1) adaptation, i.e., acquisition of short foreign DNA sequences (spacers) into CRISPR arrays; 2)
production of mature protective CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs), and 3) interference, when Cas nucleases
guided by crRNAs destroy nucleic acids containing complementary targets. Studies of the interference
part of CRISPR response have revolutionized the field of genomic editing. The less-studied adaptation
part limits global horizontal gene transfer and can be harnessed for creation of DNA-based recording
devices and control of the spread of antibiotic resistance genes. Initial CRISPR immunity is built in the
course of “naïve”, non-discriminate acquisition of short intracellular DNA molecules – prespacers - as
spacers into CRISPR arrays. It occurs very infrequently and can lead to suicidal self-interference. A
remarkable mechanism called “priming” operates in type I CRISPR-Cas systems: acquisition of spacers
from DNA with sequences matching pre-existing spacers is dramatically stimulated compared to naïve
acquisition from DNA devoid of such sequences. Primed adaptation is highly beneficial to the host: it
rapidly leads to specific acquisition of additional interference-proficient spacers from genetic parasites
and ensures that no self-targeting spacers are selected. The mechanistic relationship between
interference and adaptation during priming is not fully clear. The goal of this proposal is to dissect
interrelationships between interference and adaptation during priming and to identify cellular processes
that feed the adaptation machinery during naïve and primed adaptation. We will use FragSeq - an
innovative high-throughput approach that identifies short intracellular DNA fragments and that was
developed during the previous funding period - to determine the structure of prespacers and of other in
vivo adaptation intermediates generated during naïve and primed adaptation in diverse CRISPR-Cas
systems classes and types, and identify non-Cas cellular proteins essential for prespacer generation and
spacer acquisition. The understanding of CRISPR adaptation that will result from our work will allow us
and others to optimize the efficiency of the adaptation process, facilitating construction of strains with
desired spacer content/immunity profiles and, by revealing processes that limit adaptation, may help
control viability of bacterial populations by inducing adaptation from cell’s own DNA and self-interference.

PI: Darrin M. York, Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ 08854-8087 USA.
 RNA enzymes (ribozymes) are fundamental in biology, and have important applications in chemistry, biotech-
nology and medicine. The scientiﬁc community is still in early stages of discovery, and the full breadth of poten-
tially transformative RNA and related nucleic acid based technology and therapeutics have yet to be realized. A
critical barrier to progress toward this realization is the lack of a predictive understanding of ribozyme mechanisms
that can be used to guide design. This proposal addresses this critical barrier by the creation of new enabling
technology to study RNA enzymes (Aim 1) that will be applied to small self-cleaving (nucleolytic) ribozymes (Aim
2), and artiﬁcially engineered self-alkylating and methyltransferase ribozymes and a naturally occurring group I
intron ribozyme (Aim 3). Predictive insight gained from these studies will unveil general principles crucial for our
understanding of RNA catalysis and the rational design of new ribozyme-based biomedical technology.
 Aim 1 will create advanced tools for computational RNA enzymology, including 1) new fast/accurate quan-
tum+machine learning force ﬁelds for RNA catalysis, 2) integrated software for inclusion of nuclear quantum
effects, and 3) robust methods for determination of reaction paths and free energy surfaces (including corrections
to expensive high-level ab initio surfaces). These methods are signiﬁcant as enabling technology to study mech-
anisms of RNA catalysis. The goal of this aim is develop innovative technology designed to meet the needs of the
driving ribozyme applications in Aims 2 and 3, as well as many applications outside the scope of the proposal.
 Aim 2 will apply our computational enzymology tools to study the catalytic mechanisms of small nucleolytic
ribozymes (Psr, HHr and HDVr) and a related artiﬁcially engineered DNAzyme (8-17dz). These systems are
important as tools for chemical and molecular biology, and as tractable models for RNA/DNA catalysis. The
goal of this aim is to apply and further develop general principles for RNA-cleaving nucleic acid enzyme design,
building on our L-platform/L-scaffold framework for naturally occurring “G+A” and “G+M” ribozyme classes.
 Aim 3 will explore mechanisms of artiﬁcially engineered self-alkylating ribozyme (SAR) and methyl transferase
ribozyme (MTR1), and the naturally occurring Tetrahymena group I intron (THr) ribozyme. These systems have
far-reaching implications for biotechnology and medicine. The goal of this aim is to examine the extent to which
design principles can be extended and transferred to these systems to provide deeper insight into the diverse
array of catalytic strategies available to nucleic acid enzymes.
 Working together, these aims will accomplish the overarching goal to achieve a predictive understanding of
ribozyme mechanisms that can be used to guide the design of new technology and therapeutics.

 Cilia play essential roles in human development and health. Ciliary ubiquity and diversity are reflected
in multi-symptom ciliopathies caused by ciliary defects. The clinical severity of ciliopathy gene mutations varies
between cell types and includes cystic kidney disease, neurological and skeletal defects, retinal degeneration,
situs inversus, and male infertility. While the same basic intraflagellar transport (IFT) machinery constructs all
cilia and flagella, the mechanisms underlying ciliary specialization are poorly understood. For example, cilia
produce extracellular vesicles (EVs). Whether EV shedding is a general property of cilia or a specialized
feature of some cilia types is unknown. The functions of ciliary EVs and their contributions to ciliopathies are
also poorly understood. The long-term goal of this project is to identify molecular mechanisms regulating ciliary
specialization, remodeling, plasticity, EV biogenesis, and EV functions. Cilia of the C. elegans inner labial-type
2 (IL2) neurons display several specializations: they have unique microtubule ultrastructure, specialized IFT,
and shed EVs. The IL2 ciliary transition zone (TZ) and axoneme is structurally plastic and remodels from one
structure to another during animal development: from a canonical 9+0 to non-canonical 6+0 structure. While
cilia and flagella share a 9-fold microtubule doublet symmetry, variations in microtubule numbers are observed
in nature. Renal primary cilia do not conform to the 9 + 0 paradigm. This developmental plasticity suggests that
some ciliary defects (ciliopathies) may be corrected at later times. Our hypothesis is supported by the recent
discovery that autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease is reversible, and that the kidney displays
structural plasticity. Our simple C. elegans model allows us to uncover mechanisms that regulate ciliary
remodeling and plasticity. We found that TZ remodeling requires IFT and the tubulin code – combinatorial use
of tubulin isotypes, glutamylation, and microtubule-associated proteins. Nephronophthisis-related ciliopathies
(NPHP-RCs) are associated with defects in TZ-associated proteins. NPHP-RCs include nephronophthisis,
Meckel Gruber (MKS), Joubert (JBTS), and Senior-Løken syndromes. The clinical severity of loss of function of
NPHP-RC genes varies between cell and cilia types, thus it is imperative to understand ciliary and EV biology
in a variety of contexts. We will use C. elegans to identify mechanisms driving transition zone and axonemal
remodeling and plasticity in non-canonical primary cilia. Ciliary EV shedding is a conserved, yet little is known
about how and why cilia make EVs. We will test the hypotheses that ciliary remodeling and a non-canonical
structure impacts EV biogenesis and EV function.

Mental disorders, including major depressive disorder, schizophrenia, and others, all share a central feature –
cognitive impairment which results in individuals confronted with difficulty in memory, concentration, and
decision-making. Emerging evidence points to two key factors contributing to cognitive decline beyond the
underlying disease pathology - exposure to 1) environmental chemicals such as endocrine disrupting
compounds (EDCs) during development and 2) chronic stress in adulthood. The interaction of chemical
exposure and stress are unknown; but together may exacerbate cognitive impairment. First, EDCs exert their
toxicity by disrupting nuclear receptor signaling during sensitive brain developmental periods. Numerous EDC
studies have detected cognitive impairments in humans and animals. One group of understudied EDCs are
organophosphate flame retardants (OPFRs) acting on nuclear and steroid receptors linked with cognition. The
association between perinatal OPFR exposure and cognitive processing has not been explored. We previously
identified an association between perinatal OPFR exposure on neonatal and juvenile hypothalamic gene
expression and adult locomotor activity and approach/avoidance behaviors. Second, mental disorders share a
common feature: exposure to stress, which contributes to cognitive dysfunction by exacerbating symptoms. A
common paradigm to recapitulate chronic stressors in rodents is to apply mild stress for 6 weeks, known as
chronic variable mild stress (CVMS). Using CVMS, the neural circuits underlying maladaptive effects of stress
include corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) neurons. CRF is co-released with norepinephrine (NE), acetylcholine
(ACh), and dopamine (DA), which control key brain regions (hippocampus, prefrontal cortex), and all are involved
in cognition and mood. Based on our prior work and the literature, I hypothesize that perinatal OPFR exposure
can disrupt cognition, alone or when combined with adult chronic stress exposure. My central hypothesis is
that EDCs such as OPFRs influence the developing cognitive and stress neurocircuitry potentially
inducing long-lasting functional deficits in cognitive processing and sensitize adults to exposure to
chronic stress in mice. In Aim 1 (K99 phase), I will first determine if perinatal OPFR exposure disrupts adult
cognition on the behavioral level and through alterations in ACh synaptic transmission using electrophysiology.
In Aim 2 (K99), I will examine the effects of OPFR exposure on regional concentrations of NE and DA and CRF
and associated gene expression in adults, and the role of hippocampal CRF neurons using optogenetics. Lastly,
in Aim 3 (R00), I will combine my prior expertise in spine density analysis and immunohistochemistry, and new
training in electrophysiology, high-performance liquid chromatography, and optogenetics to determine if the
combination of perinatal OPFR exposure and adult CVMS alters cognition. The ultimate goal of my research
program will be to determine the interactions of perinatal EDC exposure and adult chronic stressors on cognitive
processing by influencing CRF and neurotransmitter signaling throughout the brain.

Transposable elements (TEs), like viruses, are genetic parasites. They use their host’s cellular machinery to
replicate and must replicate faster than their host to avoid extinction. Replication of TEs in host cells causes
damaging mutations: TE insertions can inactivate host genes and cause chromosomal rearrangements. Host
genomes have therefore evolved sophisticated silencing pathways to identify TEs and suppress their
replication activity. However, active TEs remain present in the genomes of almost all eukaryotes. One
explanation for their persistence over evolutionary time is that, like viruses, TEs evolve rapidly to escape host
silencing, which in turn selects for an adaptive response from the host, thus locking TEs and their hosts into an
evolutionary arms race. Unlike viruses, whose immune evasion strategies have been well-studied, the
mechanisms by which TEs are able to escape host silencing are relatively unknown. The overall goal of our
research program is to understand strategies used by TEs to escape host silencing and how such strategies
affect host phenotypes and/or disease states.
Our research is currently focused on three such strategies: (1) Permissive niches for TE mobilization: one way
TEs can escape host silencing is by preferentially mobilizing in vulnerable cell types and/or being transcribed
highly enough to overwhelm host defenses. Our goal for this research direction is to identify novel permissive
niches and understand the mechanisms TEs use to gain expression in these cell types. (2) Host gene capture
by TEs: Drosophila telomeres are composed of specialized retrotransposons that replicate onto the
chromosome ends. These elements likely evolve in conflict with their host despite serving an essential cellular
function. We have identified telomeric retrotransposons in over 100 species of Drosophila and found that these
elements have repeatedly captured fragments of host TE silencing genes. Our goal for this research direction
is to understand this gene capture phenomenon and how it is used by TEs to evade host silencing. (3) TE
derepression in species hybrids: hybrid dysgenesis occurs in F1 progeny when a TE is present in the paternal
genome but missing from the maternal genome. Small RNAs that target such a TE are therefore unable to be
supplied to the embryo by the mother and the TE becomes hyperactivated in the progeny, usually resulting in
DNA damage, sterility, and gonadal atrophy. We have discovered a novel exception to this phenomenon where
a gypsy family TE is massively upregulated in F1 progeny without an obvious effect on fertility. This situation
provides a unique opportunity for studying post-transcriptional regulation of TE activity.

 The current understanding of vitamin A metabolism in extrahepatic tissues is that hepatic retinoid stores are
mobilized as retinol bound to retinol-binding protein 4 (RBP4) and delivered through the circulation to the cells
where they are taken up and used for all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) synthesis and ATRA-mediated transcriptional
regulation. Our preliminary data challenge this paradigm and indicate that retinoids are delivered to the lung
predominantly via circulating lipoproteins, a previously ignored pathway for retinoid delivery involving the action of
lipoprotein-metabolizing proteins. We found from our novel studies employing single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-
seq) of cells possessing vitamin A fluorescence that lipofibroblasts (LFs), endothelial (ECs), and epithelial cells
(AECs) all accumulate retinoids in form of retinyl esters (REs) and all express key genes needed to allow for
postprandial lipoprotein-derived vitamin A uptake, storage, and intercellular transport. Moreover, our mouse model
studies compellingly establish that the mice lacking locally stored retinoids in the lung develop more severe acute
lung injury resulting in death due to the loss of alveolar barrier integrity and impaired surfactant production. This
occurs even though mice are fed a nutritional complete chow diet, circulating vitamin A levels are normal, and the
animals are not otherwise vitamin A-insufficient. These findings lead us to hypothesize that lipoprotein-derived and
locally stored cellular vitamin A is preferentially processed, as opposed to circulating or systemic retinol, for ATRA
synthesis and signaling via nuclear retinoic acid receptors (RARs). We are proposing in-depth studies to explore
the metabolic consequences of vitamin A transport and how local vitamin A stores are acquired, metabolized, and
processed to mount protective cellular responses. Aim 1 will delineate the mechanisms that allow ECs, LFs, and
AEC2s to take up, accumulate, and intercellularly transfer retinoids. We will determine how retinoids are taken up
by these cells from circulating lipoproteins and redistributed among them. This will be achieved by kinetic studies
employing tracer labeling of retinoids in mice lacking cell-specific expression of Lpl, Cd36, and Lrp1 as well as in
cultured mouse and human cells coupled with lipidomics analyses. Aim 2 will establish how alterations in vitamin
A stores, which are primarily located in intracellular lipid droplets of the LFs, define the transcriptional and
phenotypic identity of the LF population. Using scRNA-seq molecular profiling coupled with immunohistochemical
spatial analysis of labeled retinoid-containing LFs, we will characterize how exposure to lipoprotein-derived
retinoids defines quiescent and profibrotic LF identity in vivo. Aim 3 will determine the crosstalk mechanisms by
which LF-derived retinoids regulate ATRA-RAR-mediated cellular functions of ECs and AEC2s. Employing genetic
and pharmacological manipulations of retinoid signaling via RARs in AEC2s and ECs coupled with lipidomics
analyses, we will dissect the crosstalk mechanisms underlying the role of LF-derived retinoids in cell-specific ATRA
signaling to regulate endothelial barrier integrity and surfactant lipid production. To further define underlying ATRA-
RAR-mediated mechanisms, we will employ human AEC2s and ECs co-cultured with retinoid-containing LFs.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Ricin, one of the most toxic substances known and a type B biothreat agent, has the same mechanism of
action as Shiga toxins (Stxs) produced by E. coli (STEC) and Shigella dysenteriae, which are foodborne
pathogens responsible for significant morbidity and mortality around the world. Despite years of research there
are no effective small molecule inhibitors of ricin or Stxs and as of now only supportive care is available.
Modulation of ribosome interactions by small molecules has not been previously explored as a strategy for
inhibition. We showed that ricin toxin A subunit (RTA) and the A1 subunit of Stx2a (Stx2A1) bind to the C-
terminal domain (CTD) of the ribosomal P-stalk proteins to depurinate the sarcin/ricin loop (SRL) at a distant
site on the large subunit of the ribosome. We identified the critical residues at the P-stalk binding site of RTA
and Stx2A1 and reported the first X-ray crystal structure of Stx2a with a P protein peptide and the first cryo-EM
structure of Stx2a holotoxin with the purified P-stalk pentamer. Peptides mimicking the CTD of P proteins bind
at a hydrophobic pocket on the opposite face of RTA/Stx2A1 relative to the active site and inhibit the activity of
both toxins, identifying the P-stalk binding site as a new target for developing small molecules. We set up
fragment-based lead discovery (FBLD) by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and discovered two fragments
that bind at the P-stalk binding site of RTA. Using structure-based design (SAR) we improved these inhibitors
and obtained lead compounds that inhibit the activity and cytotoxicity of ricin and Stx2a holotoxin in
mammalian cells. In this revised application, we propose to use a new fluorescence polarization assay to
enable robust SAR evaluation and the design of second-generation lead compounds that inhibit the activity of
ricin and Stx2a. We will test the hypothesis that the hydrophobic pocket at the P-stalk binding site of RTA and
Stx2A1 can serve as a highly druggable site for developing small molecules that can be used to dissect the
depurination mechanism of the ribosome inactivating proteins. In aim one, we will design new analogs based
on trends in SAR revealed from our recent work, to improve binding interactions while improving physical
properties. We will use docking and binding site analysis by SiteMap, WaterMap and FEP+ to optimize our
leads. We will determine the affinities using a new fluorescence polarization assay, analyze potency in cell-free
and cell-based assays and identify the binding modes by X-ray crystallography and NMR. A supplemental
virtual screen against RTA will be used to identify new chemical scaffolds and new binding elements to
combine with our current leads. In the second aim, we will use NMR analysis to investigate the mechanism of
action of lead compounds to test the hypothesis that P-stalk binding indirectly influences the active site
residues to allosterically regulate depurination activity at the catalytic site of RTA and Stx2A1. The product of
our efforts will be chemical tools to elucidate P-stalk binding and activation mechanisms and may result in
advanced lead compounds for the development of post-exposure therapeutics against ricin and STEC.

Life and Death in the Nursery will analyze the emergence of a new subspecialty – neonatology – and the
medical technologies employed by neonatologists. The development of new sophisticated machinery
meant that clinicians were now able to keep infants alive who in earlier years would have died. In the
1960s, hospitals around the country established NICUs. Clinicians and parents approached this highly
technological world with worries over the health and lives of severely ill newborns and negotiated
significant medical ethics questions about life, death, and quality of life. They debated these questions
within the emerging bioethics’ movement and in a larger social and cultural context in which attitudes
about reproduction, disability, quality of life, and death and dying shaped their respective understanding
about the ethics surrounding life and death. I will investigate how health care providers and parents
experienced the NICU, how it shaped their identity, and what impact their personal position and
understanding of neonatology had on their clinical experiences. The book will focus on the impact that
changes in medical technologies, reproductive politics, our understanding of disabilities, and attitudes
about race had on clinical care and the ways these changes shaped medicine in the NICU. This analysis
not only sheds light on the history of neonatology itself, but also points to ongoing dilemmas in
medicine: decisions about the continuation/ discontinuation of therapies at the edges of life and death,
as well as the pervasive existence of health inequities. Clinical issues inside the NICU are embedded in a
larger context of women’s reproductive health care. Much happens to women, their pregnancies, and
fetuses before infants enter the NICU and these events determine the problems with which infants
present. How women become pregnant, what kinds of screening and prenatal care they receive, their
access to abortion care, and how they give birth has changed significantly over the course of the last six
decades, leading to concomitant shifts in the demographic characteristics and clinical problems of NICU
patients. Taking the NICU as a focal point, my study addresses larger questions about life, death, and
quality of life that continue to be of importance in clinical care – in the NICU and beyond: How do
therapies, treatments, and procedures in one medical specialty shape the clinical problems in another?
How should clinicians balance rapid technological and therapeutic innovation with the development of
standards of care? In an area of rapid innovation, where therapies quickly move from experimental to
innovative, routine, and outdated, how do researchers adhere to treatment protocols and informed
consent? And how do patients and family members understand and participate in clinical decision
making in a specialty where so much seems at stake and hopes are so high?

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Abstract: Tourette Syndrome (TS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by urges to perform tics
which are repetitive, stereotyped, and uncontrollable movements or sounds. The CDC estimates that TS and
related chronic tic disorders affect ~1 in 50 children. Despite the high prevalence, the underlying neuropathology
is poorly understood. A lack of preclinical animal models is a large reason for this current impasse in TS research.
This grant proposes a new way to overcome this barrier using novel mouse models generated in our lab that
express orthologous human mutations identified in a high-confidence TS gene, CELSR3. Preliminary data shows
these mice exhibit tic-like stereotypies in the open field, with sex-dependent variable expressivity, and also
changes to striatal dopamine. Leveraging these novel mice with construct and face validity, I will test the
hypothesis that tics are associated with changes to habit formation and dopamine signaling. Habits and tics are
highly similar: they are both repetitive, stereotyped, and automated actions that once formed are hard to break.
It is proposed in TS that a potentiation of sensorimotor inputs onto striatal circuits regulating habit formation
along with potentially weaker engagement of circuits controlling goal-directed behavior may predispose
individuals to develop ‘tic-habits’. Further, ‘tic-habits’ may be perpetuated by aberrant DA signaling, which
reinforces and motivates these learned behaviors. Human studies have demonstrated that TS probands develop
habits quicker, an effect not seen in medicated probands on DA stabilizers (aripiprazole). Additionally, habit
reversal therapy is proven to help decrease tics in ~40% of TS subjects, further suggesting a link between habits
and tics. However, these findings have yet to be tested and confirmed in animal models, and the
neurodevelopmental circuit changes regulating habit formation in TS remain uninvestigated. Similar to human
findings, my preliminary data suggests Celsr3 TS mice form habits faster and have difficultly breaking them (akin
to difficulty seen in ceasing to tic). Interestingly, some tic-like stereotypies are more pronounced in female mice,
suggesting sex-differences need to be explored. Thus, I hypothesize Celsr3 TS mice will demonstrate enhanced
habitual responding and changes to DA signaling during early stages of habit formation, which may be influenced
by sex. I also hypothesize that these phenotypes will be normalized with aripiprazole, as observed in human
subjects. In Aim 1, I will use instrumental learning paradigms to test if habit formation and goal-directed behaviors
are enhanced and/or weakened, respectively. Deciphering potential circuit imbalances between these two
systems will provide insight into neurodevelopmental circuit changes proposed in TS. In Aim 2, I will use in vivo
imaging and fiber photometry to investigate DA signaling while mice form habits. I will also administer aripiprazole
to test if I can normalize habitual behavior to control levels. These experiments will be the first to investigate
habit formation and DA dysregulation in TS using bona fide TS mouse models with true construct and face
validity. These results will help explain the neurobiological basis of tics, helping to improve treatment strategies.

Research into the mechanisms underlying methamphetamine craving, a key driver of relapse, is dwarfed in
comparison to other drugs of abuse (e.g., cocaine, opioids). Exacerbated drug craving can be modeled in rats
using the incubation of methamphetamine craving paradigm. The nucleus accumbens plays a key role in
mediating drug seeking which intensifies commensurate with abstinence duration. Approximately 95% of
accumbens neurons are GABAergic medium spiny neurons which can be distinguished by expression of the
D1 dopamine receptors (D1DRs) or D2 dopamine receptors (D2DRs), although a relatively small proportion of
these cells express both of these receptors. Canonically, D1DR-containing neurons were thought to project
exclusively to the ventral tegmental area, whereas D2DR-expressing accumbens efferents extended to the
ventral pallidum; however, recent evidence suggests that there is some overlap such that D1DR-containing
neurons also project to the ventral pallidum and modulate drug seeking. Generally, D1DR-containing neurons
promote drug-related behaviors, whereas D2DR-containing neurons inhibit drug-related behaviors. Importantly,
the influence of specific projections of these neuronal subtypes on methamphetamine seeking is unknown.
Specific Aim 1 will combine D1DR-Cre and D2DR-Cre transgenic rats, optogenetics, and electrophysiology to
dissociate the role of D1DR- vs. D2DR-containing striatopallidal and striatotegmental projections in the
incubation of methamphetamine craving. The time-dependent molecular adaptations within accumbens D1DR-
containing and D2DR-containing neurons that occur during abstinence from methamphetamine are also
unexplored. Very recent advances in single cell sequencing methodologies have enabled simultaneous
profiling of the transcriptome and chromatin accessibility in defined cell populations. This is particularly relevant
for the current proposal since it will allow us to differentiate in silico effects in accumbens neurons which
express either the D1DR or D2DR. Specific Aim 2 will define the landscape of accessible chromatin and gene
expression by coupling ATAC sequencing and RNA sequencing from the same single nuclei droplets in rats
following short or prolonged abstinence from methamphetamine. Functional validation of a candidate gene will
be performed by bidirectionally manipulating gene expression in selectively in D1DR-containing or D2DR-
containing neurons and assessing the incubation of methamphetamine craving. Collectively, the proposed
studies will elucidate the neurocircuitry and molecular mechanisms underlying the incubation of
methamphetamine craving.

This proposal is a renewal application of R01 (AI130197). In the previous funding cycle, we sought to identify
the mechanism(s) by which the small adaptor protein Crk controls NK cell activation and inhibition, using
human NK cells and NK cell-specific conditional knockout mice. We found that Crk phosphorylation plays a key
role in function and that Crk haploinsufficiency leads to NK cell deficits and impaired integrin signaling.
Importantly, we identified new small molecule inhibitors of pCrk (Patent #: 63/305,354). In the proposed
renewal, we use this new tool to further dissect Crk’s ability to integrate activating and inhibitory input at the
immune synapse (IS) of both NK and T cells in a variety of relevant settings: in high-resolution live human
primary cell imaging assays, in human Crk haploinsufficiency, and in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). We
test our central hypothesis that Crk functions as a master regulatory switch, fine-tuning activating and
inhibitory influences via interactions with downstream molecules and the actin cytoskeleton, and propose the
new hypothesis that pCrk inhibition can restore exhausted immune responses in cancer via novel signaling
pathways. Guided by strong preliminary data, we propose three Specific Aims: 1) How does Crk function as
a master regulatory switch to control NK cell function? Here, we use cutting-edge imaging systems, lipid
bilayers, live human primary cells, RNA-Seq, and our new CrkL inhibitors to determine where Crk, pCrk, and
their upstream and downstream partners localize in the cytotoxic, inhibitory, and exhausted IS, and how pCrk
inhibitors influence NK signaling in healthy and exhausted NK cells. 2) How does Crk influence immune
function and integrin signaling in pDGS T cells? Our previous program showed that NK cells from patients
with pDGS – a common genetic syndrome resulting from haploinsufficiency of CrkL-containing locus 22q11 –
exhibit functional NK cell deficiencies, as well as defective integrin activation at the IS. We expand these
studies to T cells, using primary pDGS patient cells and integrin conformation-specific antibodies to assess
how Crk functions as a two-way regulatory switch for CTL function. We present data that haploinsufficiency of
CRKL results in functional T cell deficits, and examine integrin signaling, T cell function, and IS quality with an
eye towards clinical application of small molecule LFA-1 agonists to restore pDGS-related functional immune
cell deficiencies. 3) Discover the role of pCrkL inhibitors in cancer immunotherapy. Our preliminary data
show that pCrk inhibitors significantly inhibit tumor growth, restore cytotoxicity of inhibitor receptor-dominant
immune cells, and enhance survival. We hypothesize that pCrk inhibitor-mediated solid tumor suppression
results from both direct tumor killing and restoration of exhausted immune cell function. In Aim 3, we use a
battery of TNBC mouse models to elucidate Crk’s molecular mechanisms in solid tumors, testing the impact of
Crk inhibition on tumor growth and cell death, immune cell function in the tumor microenvironment, and
metastasis. Our long-term goal is to develop new treatments for human immunodeficiencies and cancer.

Anxiety disorders such as panic disorders, generalized anxiety disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder
(PTSD) affect approximately 18% of the American population with a health care cost of more than $42 billion a
year, a significant burden to the US economy. Development and maintenance of anxiety disorders have been
attributed to persistent fear memories, inadequate fear extinction, and maladaptive avoidance behavior. Thus,
it is imperative to understand the neural mechanisms underlying aversive learning in order to be able to develop
efficacious treatments for these disorders. In this project, we will focus on understanding the involvement of the
insula, a brain region heavily involved not only in aversive learning in general but also processes determining
approach/avoidance behaviors. Specifically, using in-vivo single cell calcium imaging via miniscopes, we will
record activity patterns of insular single cell ensembles during fear learning when the aversive outcome
(footshock) is inescapable as well as when the aversive outcome is omitted (fear extinction; Aim1a) and when
it becomes escapable (avoidance learning; Aim1b). Finally, using a novel theoretical-computational approach
to functionally cluster fear learning single cell ensembles in the insula, we will predict whether mice will develop
extinction resistant fear or impaired avoidance learning (Aim2). Thus, in this proposal, we aim to investigate the
involvement of the insular single cell ensembles in aversive learning and develop a novel computational tool to
predict future maladaptive aversive learning phenotypes based on the neural signaling in the insula.

Replication protein A (RPA) is required for nearly every DNA repair and replication process. RPA binds single-
stranded DNA and interacts with dozens of proteins at sites of DNA maintenance. We are interested in the
protein complexes that form between RPA and other proteins when performing specific DNA repair tasks. The
current project examines RPA’s role as a central scaffold in uracil base excision repair. Our approach is to
manipulate the binding of RPA to Uracil DNA Glycosylase (UNG2) to examine the relevance of their
interaction. We have developed a strategy to covalently tether together RPA and UNG2 to form mini DNA
repair complexes that resemble the architecture of the two proteins when they interact in cells. Our Preliminary
Data demonstrates our success at forming RPA-UNG2 protein complexes in both cellular and recombinant
systems. This allows us to definitively determine how RPA functions as part of a protein complex with UNG2,
and complementary studies examine the effects of weakening their association. Specifically, Aim 1 uses
purified RPA and UNG2 constructs to examine the activity of the proteins alone or as part of a complex.
Binding and enzymatic experiments using synthetic DNA substrates will determine the structural nature of their
substrates in vivo. We focus specifically on the action of RPA and UNG2 at ssDNA-dsDNA junctions, their
known substrates, by preparing uracilated fork-like DNA structures that resemble replication forks found in the
nucleus. Aim 2 examines the RPA-UNG2 protein complex in human colorectal cells under conditions of uracil
stress that are induced by commonly used chemotherapeutic agents. The strength of RPA’s interaction with
UNG2 will be controlled and correlated with UNG2’s uracil excision efficiency at the replication fork. Finally,
additional cellular proteins that associate with RPA and UNG2 will be identified. The function of these proteins
will be examined in the context of multi-protein complexes that form during uracil base excision repair. The
targeted scope of this project examining RPA in base excision repair will facilitate our methodological
development, which will be widely adaptable for examining RPA-containing protein complexes in other DNA
repair processes.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), Lewy body disease, amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis (ALS), frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), and prion disease constitute a group
of neurogenerative diseases called proteinopathies. They are characterized by the accumulation
of aggregated and misfolded proteins in the central nervous system. The identities of the
aggregated disease proteins have been identified but how they work at a mechanistic level and
contribute to disease pathogenesis remains unclear. Moreover, despite having common co-
occurring pathology, little is known about the relationship between these proteinopathies,
complicating potential treatment options. Recent evidence has shown a link between the
mitochondrial-mediated clearance of aggregated proteins and the preservation of neuronal cell
integrity. Likewise, established model systems of proteinopathies have both demonstrated similar
results and carved a way to study the molecular details of these diseases. In this grant, we
propose to the budding yeast S. cerevisiae and mammalian cells including neurons to address
the role of mitochondria and cyclin C in the clearance of the aggregated disease proteins. Of
these proteins TDP-43, has emerged as a key player in AD, ALS, and FTLD. Studies in yeast
have revealed that cyclin C, a conserved member of the Cdk8 kinase module of the mediator
complex, plays a role in TDP-43 toxicity. Our studies point to cyclin C’s known interaction with

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Project Summary
Age of puberty is one the most reliable predictors of later mental health outcomes in girls, with early menarche
greatly increasing the risk of depression in early adulthood. Environmental exposure to endocrine disrupting
compounds (EDCs) has been linked with early puberty onset in girls. Despite this, the neurobiological
consequences of EDC exposure, and how they might predispose to depression, remain poorly understood. In a
series of preliminary studies, we showed that peripubertal exposure to a model EDC, bisphenol-A (BPA),
accelerates puberty onset in female rats, and predisposes to behaviors in early adulthood that are reminiscent
of anhedonia, a core symptom of clinical depression. These changes were associated with a persistent
impairment in the functioning of the orexin neuropeptide system, the activity of which is normally important for
translating motivational states into reward behaviors. Specifically, BPA was associated with reduced reactivity
of orexin neurons to reward-predictive stimuli, as well as reduced orexin terminals in ventral tegmental area
(VTA), a key region through which orexins initiate reward-directed actions. Based on these data, we hypothesize
that: at doses that promote early puberty onset, BPA produces a persistent impairment in the functioning of the
orexin-VTA circuit. We predict that these changes are causally linked to the anhedonia-like phenotype observed
in early adulthood in BPA-exposed rats. Here, we propose three distinct, yet interrelated aims to begin testing
our hypothesis. In Aim 1, we will characterize the baseline activity (using electrophysiology) of VTA-projecting
orexin neurons in BPA-exposed rats and determine how this is related to the expression of anhedonia-like
behavior in early adulthood. In Aim 2, we will use fiber photometry recordings of a novel orexin sensor to measure
orexin signaling in VTA in response to reward-predictive stimuli. Finally, in Aim 3, we will use chemogenetics to
stimulate the orexin-VTA circuit to test its causal role in the expression of anhedonia-like behavior following BPA.
These studies will be the first to determine the effect of EDC exposure on orexin neurons and their circuits, and
will determine their mechanistic involvement in depression outcomes in a model of early puberty onset. The
proposed project is thus highly relevant to the goal of NIEHS to understand the impact of environmental chemical
exposures on psychiatric illness. Moreover, these studies are a critical first step for developing novel strategies
to improve mental health outcomes in young women.

T cells play a central role in the anti-cancer immune response. Engineering and administrating tumor-specific T
cells have successfully treated some types of cancer. Compared to chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell
therapies, T cell receptor (TCR)-T cells engage tumor cells through engineered TCRs that bind peptides
presented by human leukocyte antigen (HLA). These peptides can be derived from tumor antigens in any
cellular compartment, making TCR-T an attractive approach to developing novel engineered T cell therapies.
Identifying suitable tumor-specific TCR is the most critical step for developing TCR-T therapies. However, only
a small number of TCRs that recognize shared tumor antigens have been identified, which is the major
bottleneck for developing novel TCR-T therapies. Here, we have identified two tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes
(TILs) from the sample patient that can be dramatically activated by three independent ccRCC cell lines,
indicating that these TILs contain T cells recognizing a shared tumor antigen. We further found that ccRCC-
TCR1 was dominant in these TILs and was shared by all activated T cells. This ccRCC-TCR1 is HLA-B0702
restricted, which is carried by ~26% of Americans. In vitro killing assays showed that these TILs are highly
cytotoxic to the ccRCC cell lines in an MHC-I-dependent manner. These data collectively suggested a high-
affinity TCR that potentially recognizes a widely shared ccRCC tumor antigen. We propose two aims to
develop TCR-T therapy with ccRCC-TCR1 to treat kidney cancer: 1) determine antigen specificity of ccRCC-
TCR1; 2) determine in vivo antitumor activity of ccRCC-TCR1 T cells. By identifying the antigen of ccRCC-
TCR1 and evaluating its antitumor activity in vivo, this translational project will pave the way for future clinical
applications. At the completion of the project, the expected outcomes are to have tumor-shared antigens
identified and move forward to conduct additional pre-clinical studies and prepare to initiate a clinical trial for
ccRCC-TCR1 T therapy.

The human body is composed of at least 400 different cell types, each distinguishable by distinct cellular markers.
Cancer cells also express distinct cellular markers, differentiating them from their precursor cell-type prior to
malignant transformation. Accordingly, the broad goal of oncology is targeted, tumor-specific therapies designed
to maximize therapeutic efficacy while avoiding undesired off-target effects. This is recognized as a major
obstacle for the application of current gene editing technologies. Proposed here is a strategy for tumor-specific
gene editing involving combined use of the chimeric adeno-associated virus / phage (AAVP) vector together with
the clustered regularly-interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) / CRISPR-associated protein (Cas) gene
editing system – collectively referred to as AAVP-CRISPR. The tissue-specific targeting aspect is carried out by
the phage capsid of AAVP, which can be modified to display a targeting peptide for ligand-directed delivery of a
desired transgene. AAVP, first introduced in 2006, is a well-characterized gene delivery tool that has been
explored in numerous tumor models. Here we plan to introduce two separate CRISPR/Cas systems with
previously demonstrated gene editing efficacy into the AAVP vector. The first construct will contain the
conventional CRISPR/Cas9 system, while the second construct will contain the more recently discovered
hypercompact CRISPR/CasΦ system, referred to as AAVP-CRISPR/Cas9 and AAVP-CRISPR/CasΦ,
respectively. The two constructs will be engineered to display RGD4C, a well-known, clinically viable tumor-
targeting peptide, and carry various gene editing guide RNA (gRNA) combinations. Gene editing using the two
constructs will first be performed in an in vitro setting, to confirm activity of the elements of each CRISPR/Cas
system, including receptor binding, cell internalization, Cas gene expression, and gene editing activity. Several
gRNA configurations will be tested in vitro and AAVP-CRISPR constructs containing the leading gRNA
candidates will be evaluated for tumor targeting, Cas expression, and gene editing activity in vivo. Successful
completion of the proposed studies will provide insight into the efficacy of AAVP-CRISPR for tumor-specific gene
editing and contribute to the development of much needed novel therapeutic strategies for cancer.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Project Summary
The lung is a major target of infections and allergies. Dendritic cells (DCs) in the lung function as sensors of
the immune system that detect and process pathogens and allergens to activate T cell-dependent adaptive
immunity. In addition, pathogens and allergens often stimulate airway sensory neurons either directly or
indirectly, leading to primary defense response such as coughing and sneezing. Recent studies highlighted
the role of neurons in immune responses, but the interaction between these two sensor modules, DCs and
sensory neurons, in inflammation in the lung is incompletely understood.
Infection with helminth parasites is a major health burden worldwide. Some helminth species such as
roundworms and hookworms in humans and Nippostrongylus brasiliensis (Nb), a commonly used model agent
to study hookworm infection in mice, traffic to the lung during their life cycle and cause potent type 2
inflammation. The larvae of these parasites stay in the lung only transiently before they get coughed up and
swallowed to migrate to the intestine, where they eventually mature and lay eggs. Thus, the cough-triggering
sensory neurons seem to play an important role in their life cycle, but their role in the regulation of inflammation
remains unclear.
We previously identified CD301b/Mgl2 as a marker for the migratory type 2 conventional DCs in peripheral
organs including the lung, and showed that CD301b+ DCs are required for the differentiation of Th2 cells. We
recently found that CD301b+ DCs are required for Nb-induced lung inflammation as well as for timely clearance
of the parasite. Interestingly, our data also suggest that CD301b+ DCs and sensory neurons suppress each
other to regulate lung inflammation during Nb infection.
Based on these data, we hypothesize that Nb parasites are sensed by CD301b+ DCs and sensory neurons,
which then mutually regulate each other to orchestrate type 2 inflammation in the lung. By using Nb infection
as a model, the long-term goal of this project is to understand how sensory neurons modulate type 2
inflammation in the lung. Since the lung is a major site not only for helminth infection but also for other type 2
inflammation disorders such as allergy, asthma and fibrosis, understanding the mechanism for the regulation of
type 2 inflammation is of clinical relevance.

The high mortality and morbidity of tuberculosis (TB), an infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium
tuberculosis (Mtb), calls for development of novel adjunct host-directed therapies (HDTs) to improve treatment
outcome and restrict the emergence of multi-drug-resistant Mtb strains. Knowledge of immunometabolism offers
new opportunities for controlling this deadly disease. We and others have characterized immunometabolic
changes in multiple animal models of TB and found that metabolic remodeling to the HIF-1-mediated Warburg
effect is a general response of host immune cells to Mtb infection. Through detailed analysis of immunometabolic
dynamics of the macrophage response to Mtb infection, we discovered that M1-like polarization at initial stages
of infection is accompanied by upregulation of ARG2, a type II arginase located in mitochondria. Given the critical
roles that mitochondria play in mediating the signaling and metabolic pathways during macrophage activation,
the upregulation of mitochondrial ARG2 suggests a little-studied role of this enzyme in M1-like polarization.
Indeed, macrophages from Arg2 KO mice showed a diminished proinflammatory response and dysregulated
mitochondrial dynamics. The identification of arginine metabolism-associated pathways, as well as upregulation
of a related set of genes that include Arg2, using metabolomics and transcriptomics studies of Mtb-infected
mouse lungs, also indicate that ARG2-mediated arginine and/or ornithine metabolism is an important regulator
of host immunity to control Mtb infection in vivo. Based on these observations, we hypothesize that mitochondrial
ARG2 activity contributes to M1-like polarization by regulating mitochondria dynamics and functions, including
generation of signaling molecules, activation of signaling networks, and changes in mitochondrial metabolism to
meet the biosynthetic and bioenergetic demands of activating macrophages. We will test the hypothesis 1) by
delineating ex vivo effects of ARG2-mediated arginine metabolism on mitochondrial biology and macrophage
polarization, using multiple approaches/assays that include stable isotope tracing metabolomics; and 2) by
characterizing the role of ARG2-mediated arginine/ornithine metabolism in regulating the expression of innate
and adaptive immunity during Mtb infection in vivo. We will also test an adjunct HDT through arginine or ornithine
supplementation to improve infection outcome. We expect to aid the development of urgently needed adjunct
HDTs with dietary supplementation of arginine/ornithine that should help clear the pathogen at an early stage of
infection, prevent reactivation from a latent infection, and/or shorten the duration of antibiotic therapy.

Breast cancer affects many women in their lifetime. A major challenge remains how to reduce breast cancer risk
as well as to understand what causes breast cancer. Two-thirds of breast cancer diagnosed in patients belong
to estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer. Many chemicals, with similar structure to estrogen, have been
suggested to mimic the biological functions of estrogen, potentially contributing to the initiation or progression of
breast cancer. Environmental estrogenic endocrine disruptor contaminants, such as bisphenols, phthalates and
zeranols, have been known to have estrogenic activity in cell culture and animal models. However, the impact
of endocrine disruptors on breast cancer development in humans remains unclear. We hypothesize that
endocrine disruptors, by increasing breast cancer stem cells and altering tumor metabolism, promote the
development of breast cancer. The objectives of this project are to determine impact of endocrine disruptors in
breast cancer development and to understand mechanisms of endocrine disruptors in alteration of cancer stem
cells and metabolome leading to accelerating ER-positive breast cancer. We propose two Specific Aims as
follows. In Aim 1, using the estrogen sensitive ACI strain, we will investigate the impact of endocrine disruptors
on the mammary gland proliferation in vivo. We will test three representative classes of common environmental
endocrine disruptors, bisphenols, phthalates and zeranols for this Aim. In Aim 2, we will determine endocrine
disruptors-induced alteration of breast cancer stem cells and cell metabolism in the ER-positive breast cancer
model. MCF-7 mammosphere culture and MCF-7 xenografted tumor models will be utilized to investigate the
role of endocrine disruptors in enhancing cancer stem cells and altering tumor metabolism in vitro and in vivo.
We will test three representative classes of endocrine disruptors, bisphenols, phthalates and zeranols in vitro.
Selected endocrine disruptors will be further evaluated for in vivo tumor studies. Endocrine disruptors have long
been suggested for its potential role in promoting cancer development and progression. This project seeks to
understand the mechanism of endocrine disruptors in the mammary tumorigenesis by focusing on cancer stem
cells and metabolism shift. Environmental factors and lifestyle have led to significant changes in breast cancer
risks. Our study with endocrine disruptors could provide the valuable link between environmental exposures and
human health.

All individuals with type 1 and >30% of those with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T1/2DM) require intensive insulin
therapy to manage their blood glucose levels. This therapy comes at a great price: increased incidence of
iatrogenic insulin-induced hypoglycemia. Insulin-induced hypoglycemia is not only acutely life-threatening,
repeated hypoglycemia (RH) impairs the ability of the brain to detect and correct subsequent hypoglycemia
allowing glucose levels to fall to dangerous, even lethal, levels. Declining glucose first triggers the hormonal
(e.g., glucagon, epinephrine) counterregulatory response (CRR) to stimulate gluconeogenesis. Further glucose
decline leads to the behavioral response known as hypoglycemia awareness which includes neurogenic (e.g.,
palpitations, anxiety) and neuroglycopenic (e.g., tiredness, confusion) symptoms that alert the individual of
hypoglycemia. RH impairs these hormonal and behavioral responses leading to hypoglycemia associated
autonomic failure (HAAF) and hypoglycemia unawareness, respectively. While the CRR and HAAF have been
studied extensively, little is known about the mechanisms underlying hypoglycemia awareness/unawareness.
This oversight was due to lack of an animal model. However, the Levin lab recently developed a rat model for
hypoglycemia awareness which we have translated into the mouse. This model enables us for the first time to
investigate how RH causes hypoglycemia unawareness. Our data suggest that orexin expressing neurons in the
perifornical hypothalamus (PFH) which are inhibited by glucose (glucose inhibited or GI) play a role in
hypoglycemia awareness. We find that RH blunts activation of PFH orexin-GI neuron in low glucose. Using our
mouse model of hypoglycemia awareness/unawareness we have shown that the dopamine reuptake inhibitor
modafinil restores hypoglycemia awareness after RH. Modafinil also restores glucose sensing by PFH orexin-GI
neurons. In this proposal we will test the hypothesis that RH increases the inhibitory effect of glucose on
PFH orexin-GI neurons leading to hypoglycemia unawareness. Modafinil, via the dopamine 1 receptor,
restores both glucose sensitivity of PFH orexin-GI neurons and hypoglycemia awareness. We will
determine how RH alters the glucose sensitivity of PFH orexin-GI neurons and how this is corrected by modafinil.
We will also determine the role of dopamine receptors in modafinil’s effect. Finally, we will determine the role of
diabetic hyperglycemia per se in hypoglycemia awareness/unawareness. These studies are the first to shed light
on the mechanisms of hypoglycemia awareness/unawareness and as such are of critical importance for patients
with T1/2DM.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the deadliest malignancies. Full transcriptome defines
clinically relevant “subtypes” of disease and the basal-like subtype of PDAC is associated with advanced
stage, metastasis, resistance to treatment, and poor patient survival. The mechanism by which the tumor
microenvironment drives PDAC subtype differentiation remains uncharacterized. Understanding the cancer-
extrinsic factors in the tumor microenvironment that promotes the basal-like state could uncover cancer
vulnerabilities and lead to the development of new therapeutic approaches. We found that inactivation of the
histone demethylase gene Kdm8 reprograms PDAC cells into a highly metastatic state. Morphologically, Kdm8
inactivation reduces the expression of genes defining the classical PDAC subtype and drives a profound loss
of differentiation in a genetically engineered PDAC mouse model. Importantly, the enzymatic function of Kdm8
requires molecular oxygen and hypoxia diminished the phenotypic changes induced by Kdm8 inactivation. We
noted a global upregulation of histone 3 lysine 27 (H3K27) trimethylation upon the inactivation of Kdm8,
supporting the involvement of its demethylase function in regulating the chromatin and cell state. In human
PDAC, KDM8-regulated gene signatures are an exceptionally good predictor of the disease subtype. Our
preliminary results suggest that hypoxia within the tumor microenvironment restricts the demethylase function
of Kdm8, thereby suppressing the classical PDAC subtype while promoting a basal-like state and metastasis
through epigenetic reprogramming. We hypothesize that a hypoxia-KDM8-chromatin axis plays a critical role in
PDAC subtype determination and metastatic ability.
In the proposed study, we aim to determine the mechanism by which Kdm8 controls PDAC subtypes and
metastatic progression and the mechanism by which hypoxia suppresses Kdm8 function to promote chromatin
reprogramming and PDAC metastasis. Overall, our study will fill the major gap in our understanding of how
hypoxia within the PDAC tumor microenvironment promotes the basal-like molecular subtype and metastasis.
Our mechanistic study will uncover fundamental insights into the role of KDM8 in subtype determination and
may discover novel vulnerabilities of the basal-like PDAC state. The long-term objective is to gain a better
understanding of the key cell-extrinsic factors in the tumor microenvironment that promote the aggressive or
basal-like PDAC subtypes.

T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is an aggressive hematologic malignancy that occurs
primarily in children but can also occur in adults. Despite recent advances in treatments, 20-50% of
patients do show primary resistance or relapse after treatment and ultimately die from their disease,
highlighting the need to discover novel targeted therapeutic approaches. The detection of highly
prevalent NOTCH1 activating mutations in T-ALL, seen in ~60% of patients, led to the discovery of
NOTCH1 signaling inhibitors such as gamma-secretase inhibitors (GSIs), that block a critical
proteolytical cleavage step required for NOTCH1 maturation and activation. GSIs are currently being
explored in clinical trials for relapsed/refractory cases, however, the responses observed as a single
agent treatment have been generally limited, such that the identification of novel targets and
combination therapies capable of delivering strong and synergistic antileukemic responses in patients
is one of the most urgent goals in the T-ALL field. Our lab has previously demonstrated the therapeutic
benefit of targeting metabolic routes in T-ALL. In this context, my preliminary results strongly
suggest that targeting the glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase (PKM) has strong antileukemic
effects on its own, and significantly synergizes with GSI treatment in vivo. Still, the role of PKM in T-
ALL remains largely unknown. Notably, PKM has two different isoforms, PKM1 and PKM2, and we
have already generated conditional knockout leukemias for each specific isoform, as well as for both
of them concomitantly, which will allow us to exquisitely analyze the effects of pyruvate kinase in
leukemia progression and response to therapy in vivo. Thus, the aim of this project is to
mechanistically dissect the function of PKM in T-ALL by using a combination of gene expression,
metabolomic profiling, epigenetic profiling and experimental therapeutics in vivo, taking advantage of
our unique genetic tools. Our results will shed light on the mechanisms by which NOTCH1 controls
cancer cell metabolism and will reveal PKM as a putative novel target for the treatment of T-ALL.

 Rapid and sensitive point of care tests that can detect all forms of drug resistance are urgently needed to
enable appropriate treatment for TB. Molecular drug susceptibility tests (mDSTs) which use nucleic acid
amplification techniques to detect mutations associated with resistance to the primary tuberculosis (TB) drugs
isoniazid (INH), and rifampin (RIF), and in a few rare cases fluoroquinolones (FQs) have demonstrated the
potential of this susceptibility testing approach. However, current mDSTs are unable to detect the large numbers
of mutations which encode for resistance to the critical new anti-tubercular drug, bedaquiline (BDQ), and linezolid
(LZD). These new drugs along with FQs and another new drug Pretominid (Pa) comprise the backbone of the
most promising TB treatments of the future. Yet, without the availability of companion mDSTs, the world risks
losing these new drugs to drug resistance within a few years of deployment. We propose to use innovative new
fluidic and assay designs to enable detection of hundreds of different mutations encoding FQ, LZD, and BDQ
resistance using the standard Cepheid assay cartridge. This new test would retain all the advantages of current
Cepheid TB assays, a robust manufacturing and instrument placement base enabled by the high volume of
assays currently produced. This research program will include 4 aims. Aim 1. Develop mis-match tolerant or
“sloppy” molecular beacons (SMBs) that identify mutations associated with FQ and LZD resistance that are
optimized for ultimate use in the new three-phase highly multiplex system to be developed in this grant. Aim 2.
BDQ assay development detecting mutations in atpE and a new SMB tiling approach that queries the entire Mtb
Rv0678 gene to identify mutations causal of BDQ resistance. Aim 3 Optimize three-phase cartridge fluidics for
highly multiplex mutation detection. Aim 4. Perform an initial laboratory and clinical validation study of the final
aim 1-3 assays using stored clinical samples.

 Rapid and sensitive point of care tests that can detect all forms of drug resistance in tuberculosis (TB) are
urgently needed to address the rise of drug resistance. We propose to develop a novel mutation detection system
that uses recently developed nanoreactor bead chemistry and the Blink Diagnostic’s testing platform to identify
both the presence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) and all of the clinically important mutations associated
with isoniazid (INH), rifampin (RIF), ethambutol (EMB), pyrazinamide (PZA), fluoroquinolone (FQ), linezolid (L),
bedaquiline (B), and pretomanid/delamanid (Pa/De) resistance. The new system will include integrated sample
processing and rapid thermal cycling technologies to produce results within 30 minutes at the point of care.
Mutations will be detected using digital and real-time PCR in novel addressable nanoreactor beads followed by
melting temperature analysis enabling robust detection of hundreds of different resistance mutations with the
sensitivity of current molecular diagnostics and the quantitation and hetero-resistance detection capacity of
digital PCR. This proposal will build upon an established partnership between Blink scientists and engineers who
previously developed highly successfully instruments and assays at Alere (currently Abbott Rapid Diagnostics),
and the academic team responsible for the suite of Xpert TB assays previously developed in collaboration with
Cepheid to perform the following specific aims: 1. Develop mis-match tolerant or “sloppy” molecular beacons
(SMBs) that identify mutations associated with INH, RIF, EMB and FQ resistance that are optimized to nanobead
format and fully functional on the Blink platform. 2. Finalize a SMB assay that queries the entire Mtb pncA gene
to identify mutations causal of PZA resistance specifically adapted for nanobead format in the BLINK system. 3.
Finalize development of cartridge based mechanical nucleic acid extraction process from sputum and other
matrixes for Mtb. 4. Expand the nanobead assay to test for all clinically relevant mutations causing with
resistance to Pa, B and L using the principals and chemistries developed in aims 1 – 2. 5. Perform initial
laboratory and clinical validation studies of the final aim 1-4 assays using stored clinical samples.

 Non-polio enteroviruses (NPEVs) are etiological agents for several human diseases including respiratory
infections, hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD), aseptic meningitis, encephalitis, neonatal sepsis,
myocarditis, conjunctivitis, and acute flaccid paralysis. Among the more than 100 serotypes of NPEVs, some of
the most significant pathogens are enterovirus D68 (EV-D68), enterovirus A71 (EV-A71) and coxsackievirus B3
(CV-B3). According to CDC, these NPEVs combined have caused 10 to 15 million infections and tens of
thousands of hospitalizations in the U.S. Clearly, NPEVs are a public concern for both U.S. and the world.
 No vaccines are available in the U.S. for the NPEVs such as EV-D68, EV-A71, and CV-B3. Three
inactivated EV-A71 vaccines are available in China. However, there are not broadly protective, and the efficacy
is limited to certain strains. There is no FDA-approved antiviral for any of these NPEVs. Thus, there is a
pressing need to develop orally bioavailable pan-enterovirus antivirals.
 This proposal focuses on targeting the enterovirus nonstructural 2C protein for the development of orally
bioavailable broad-spectrum NPEV antivirals. Specifically, in Aim 1, we will optimize the antiviral activity and
pharmacokinetic properties of three series of 2C inhibitors. In Aim 2, we will determine the high-resolution X-
ray crystal structures of EV-A71, EV-D68, and CV-B3 2C proteins with structurally disparate 2C inhibitors. In
Aim 3, we will evaluate the in vivo antiviral efficacy of 2C inhibitors in EV-D68 and EV-A71 infection mouse
models. Successful implementation of this proposal will provide orally bioavailable broad-spectrum NPEV drug
candidates for further development.

Early detection of tuberculosis (TB) disease to prevent transmission and disability is hampered
by the lack of precise biomarkers to diagnose and predict TB progression. The objective of this
study is to develop computational imaging tools to characterize and diagnose individuals
without TB symptoms who will progress to sputum culture-positive or symptomatic TB disease.
In Aim 1, we will combine computed tomography (CT) scans from existing and prospective TB
household contact studies to derive a high-resolution radiomic signature to predict and
characterize early disease pathology. In Aim 2, we will evaluate methods to enhance
performance of field-deployable chest-X-ray computer aided detection (CAD) systems to
diagnose early TB using transfer learning, image-to-image training, and integration of clinical
and epidemiologic variables. Our goal is to develop a fundamental toolbox for research,
diagnosis, and targeted preventive treatment of early TB to prevent transmission and
accelerate TB control.

Prostate cancer (CaP) is the leading non-cutaneous cancer in men, accounting for roughly 1 in 5 new cases and
1 in 10 deaths from cancer per year. Few modifiable risk factors have been identified for CaP, limiting
opportunities for primary prevention. In the US, Black men experience over twice the rate of mortality from CaP
compared to White men, disparities that are partly explained by differences in neighborhood environmental
context. Black men are often exposed to higher burden of environmental pollutants due to segregation and
neighborhood disinvestment, which may contribute to disparities. Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS)
are synthetic industrial chemicals of public health concern due to their ubiquitous presence and persistence in
the body and environment, as well as growing evidence of their adverse health impacts. Certain PFAS have
been classified as Group 2B (“possible”) carcinogens by the Institute of Agency for Cancer. Some studies in
populations with high occupational or community exposures to PFAS have shown elevated risk of CaP, but few
studies have examined these associations in large racially-diverse, population-based studies. I propose to study
three commonly measured PFAS (PFOA, perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), and perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA)
as potential risk factors for aggressive CaP and CaP disparities in New Jersey. I will develop a spatiotemporal
model of drinking water PFAS exposure using multiple geographic datasets capturing business, hydrology,
meteorologic, and census variables. Modeled PFAS exposure will be linked to masked residential address
histories collected from men diagnosed with CaP in the New Jersey State Cancer Registry to estimate the risk
of advanced CaP associated with increasing levels of PFAS. I will then conduct a pilot study among patients
seeking CaP treatment at the Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey. I will evaluate differences in PFAS souces
by different sociodemographic groups, and study associations between serum PFAS and risk of biochemical
reccurrence among men treated for CaP. This research will be complemented by a training program to develop
knowledge and skills in health effects of endocrine-disrupting chemicals, spatiotemporal modeling of
environmental chemicals, primary data collection and biospecimen collection, and molecular alterations involved
in prostate carcinogenesis. I have invited a multidisciplinary team of environmental and cancer researchers to
support my training. My short-term goals are to develop expertise in pathways through which PFAS and related
endocrine-disrupting chemicals influence CaP, and disseminate findings through conference presentations and
publications. My long-term goal is to become an independent scientist and expert in multilevel environmental
and biological pathways that influence CaP progression and outcomes. Preliminary data generated through this
project will support the development of an R01 proposal to clarify mechanisms through which PFAS and other
endocrine-disrupting chemicals influence tumor biology and risk of recurrence following treatment for CaP.

The purpose of this research is to assess the use and effects of a new generation of misleading descriptors
and imagery in combustible tobacco marketing. While regulatory efforts to date have made strides in restricting
the use of especially misleading terms in tobacco marketing (e.g., “mild”, “natural”), industry marketing has
evolved to utilize newer descriptors and imagery that are known to be associated with these restricted terms;
yet, research studying this evolution is quite limited. As the tobacco industry continues to mislead consumers
with attempts to skirt regulatory actions via implied reduced risk claims (e.g., “organic”, “tobacco and water”), it
is crucial to track their misleading marketing tactics and monitor effects on vulnerable youth and young adults
(YYAs), especially as this suggestive marketing for traditional tobacco products now exists alongside other
products actually authorized for designation as modified risk (i.e., Modified Risk Tobacco Products, or MRTPs).
Through a preliminary literature and marketing content review under Aim 1, this research will characterize
newer descriptors and imagery utilized in misleading marketing for combustible tobacco products (because
these products pose the greatest harms), focusing specifically on cigarettes and cigarillos. Aim 1 focus groups
with YYAs will assess attention, product appeal, and risk perceptions for products advertised/packaged with
these descriptors and imagery, as well as other products by the same brands and MRTPs. Results will inform a
discrete choice experiment (DCE) (Aim 2) that manipulates a series of target descriptors and images as well as
modified risk claims on cigarette and cigarillo packs, in order to isolate independent and joint effects of the
target features on product appeal and preferences. Under Aim 3, an eye-tracking study will examine young
people’s attention to ads and packs using salient descriptors and images (per focus group and DCE results),
and in combination with the prior activities, will provide preliminary data to inform research avenues for future
regulatory efforts. This K01 will support the pursuit of my long-term career goal of becoming an independent
tobacco control researcher at the intersection of tobacco policy, health communication, and tobacco misbeliefs;
it will develop my content expertise (i.e., trends in/effects of cigarette and cigarillo marketing) and cultivate new
methodological skillsets (i.e., focus groups, DCE, eye-tracking). The proposed research will allow me to work
towards research independence and an R01 grant to further study misleading tobacco marketing, with a new
focus on additional products and an emphasis on regulatory remedy.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
 Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are biologically and environmentally persistent anthropogenic
chemicals. Over 98% of the U.S. population has detectable levels of PFAS in their blood (serum). People may
be exposed to PFAS through contaminated drinking water and food, house dust, or consumer products. Some
populations may experience additional PFAS exposures from their jobs or hobbies. PFAS are of public health
concern because of their associations with numerous adverse health outcomes including dyslipidemia, an
imbalance of blood lipids such as high cholesterol. Dyslipidemia is a primary risk factor for ischemic heart disease
(IHD), the leading cause of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the U.S. and globally.
 Volunteer firefighters are community members who fill a critical public safety function, particularly in suburban
and rural areas. Firefighters can be exposed to PFAS through combustion products, firefighting foams, and
firefighter protective clothing. The association between PFAS exposure and dyslipidemia is of major concern in
this population because cardiac events are the primary cause of line-of-duty deaths among all firefighters.
However, the extent and pathways of volunteer firefighters’ PFAS exposures, and the ways these exposures
may affect their blood lipid levels, are unknown. While 65% of the over 1 million U.S. firefighters are volunteers,
they are understudied, creating critical knowledge gaps in evidence-based efforts to protect and improve the
health of volunteer firefighters and the communities they serve.
 To address these gaps, we will leverage existing data from the Rutgers Firefighter Cancer Assessment and
Prevention Study (CAPS), a cohort of volunteer firefighters from 8 U.S. states. This F31 fellowship builds upon
the applicant’s preliminary work with CAPS data using pilot funding. Two specific aims will be used to achieve
the objectives of identifying (a) predictors of serum PFAS concentrations including sociodemographic,
firefighting, and occupational characteristics, and (b) associations between PFAS and lipid concentrations in
volunteer firefighters. Aim 1: Assess the seroprevalence, predictors, and possible exposure sources of
PFAS among U.S. volunteer firefighters. We hypothesize that heterogeneous distributions and concentrations
of serum PFAS will be associated primarily with community-related exposure sources. Aim 2: Examine
associations between serum PFAS and dyslipidemia among U.S. volunteer firefighters. We hypothesize
that serum PFOA and PFOS (the most frequently detected and studied PFAS) will be positively associated with
total cholesterol and LDL. We will also assess associations between less commonly studied PFAS and seven
lipid measures. We will use single-pollutant and mixture models to characterize the effects of multiple
simultaneous PFAS exposures. This work will advance our understanding of the health impacts of this
environmental exposure in a critical population of community-based first responders.

Tuberculosis (TB) is a global health crisis. As the second leading cause of death due to infectious disease, it
claims roughly 1.5 million lives a year. Although TB can be treated, the curative regimen is complicated and
takes several months. Drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), including totally drug-resistant strains,
is steadily increasing in prevalence. Therefore, novel therapeutics with the potential to decrease treatment
duration and increase barriers to resistance are essential for disease eradication. Most TB drug discovery
programs have taken target-based approaches and largely ignored intrabacterial metabolism. However, several
first- and second- line antituberculars penetrate Mtb as prodrugs and are intrabacterially metabolized into their
active form. When faced with the markedly lipid-rich, hydrophobic environment of the Mtb cell envelope, prodrugs
have the ability to enter the cell and subsequently release more polar, Mtb-active moieties within the bacterium.
Most Mtb prodrugs are activated by non-essential enzymes, and, as a consequence, resistance develops
quickly. For example, pyrazinamide (PZA), a key first-line antitubercular that enables a shortened TB drug
regimen, is activated to pyrazinoic acid (POA) by the non-essential amidase PncA, and the vast majority of PZA
resistance is caused by mutations in this activating gene. Notably, several other Mtb amidases have also been
shown to metabolize amide antituberculars, thereby activating prodrugs and inactivating active drug compounds.
We hypothesize that we can harness Mtb amidases to design and activate amide prodrugs within Mtb that are
active in drug-resistant disease and that have increased barriers to resistance. Our proposal aims to 1) study
the amide-amidase interactions to identify amide prodrugs that are activated by more than one amidase and 2)
link POA to amine metabolites from parent compounds that demonstrate amide hydrolysis within Mtb to generate
potential POA-releasing conjugates that are activated by non-PncA amidases. The majority of amidases are
non-essential and likely have overlapping functions, enabling the discovery of amide-containing antituberculars
that are activated by multiple amidases. Furthermore, the release of POA by amidases other than PncA would
retain PZA-like activity in PZA-resistant strains, restoring the activity of a first-line antitubercular critical for shorter
TB regimens. This approach will introduce a novel framework for TB prodrug discovery that can be applied to
other classes of small molecules and their activating enzymes. In all, the proposed project and training plan will
greatly further my development as a researcher and independent scientific thinker by introducing me to new
scientific concepts and techniques and providing ample opportunity for me the integrate my research and clinical
experiences. Together, Rutgers New Jersey Medical School, the Public Health Research Institute, and the
Global TB Institute create a highly collaborative and highly translational environment that uniquely benefit my
training as an infectious disease physician-scientist.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Invasion is one of the most detrimental features of all cancers, including breast cancer, as it allows cells to
escape the primary site and form metastases at distant organs. Despite progress in prevention and early
lesions detection, the mortality associated with metastatic breast cancer is still extremely high. This is
especially true for patients presenting with triple negative breast cancer (TNBC, characterized by lack of
expression of ER, PR, and Her2 ), which is the most aggressive and deadliest subtype of breast cancer and
the one that so far lack specific targets for therapeutic intervention. Understanding the mechanisms that
facilitate the invasion of tumor cells will enable us to design more efficient therapeutic strategies to prevent or
reduce metastasis.
Our group has established a fundamental connection between GTP metabolism and tumor cell invasiveness;
we have unveiled GTP and its metabolic enzymes (GME) as key players in tumor progression and metastatic
potential. We have developed unique fluorescent reporters for intracellular GTP that have allowed us to
determine that, in live cells, the intracellular GTP distribution is not uniform, and brought forward the hypothesis
that local concentration of GTP can influence GTP-dependent processes. In particular, we have previously
shown that genetic or pharmacological modulation of the GTP metabolic pathway deeply affected the
activation status of small GTPases of the RHO-family and, with it, the tumor cells' invasive capability. Thus, in
Aim 1 we will explore a novel mechanism of G-proteins activation based on GME subcellular localization.
Our preliminary results showed that the rate-limiting enzyme for GTP de novo production, inositol
monophosphate dehydrogenase 2 (IMPDH2) enriches at cell membrane sites that are critical for cell migration
and invasion (namely focal adhesion, FA, and invadopodia). The role of IMPDH2 at these sites is virtually
uncharacterized. Thus, in Aim 2 we will assess the catalytic and structural role of IMPDH2 in FA and
invadopodia formation, as well as in focal adhesion kinase (FAK)-directed oncogenic motility.
The understanding of GTP metabolic enzymes transcriptional regulation is far from complete. Identification of
transcriptional master regulators of the GTP biosynthetic pathway that could be pharmacologically targeted
would offer a more efficient way of suppressing this pathway. Our preliminary results suggest that Kruppel-like
factor 9 (KLF9) and aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) play antagonistic roles in the transcriptional regulation of
GTP metabolic enzymes, with KLF9 suppressing, whereas AHR inducing GTP production. Thus, in Aim 3 we
will elucidate this regulation and explore pharmacological treatments to regulate the activity of these
transcription factors.

Major depressive disorder and other mood disorders are heterogeneous, debilitating illnesses that affect millions
of individuals worldwide. Antidepressants that target the serotonergic system (e.g., SSRIs) remain the most
effective treatment for these disorders and are widely used. However, emerging data show that maternal
antidepressant treatment affects the long-term health and neurodevelopment of offspring through, as yet poorly
understood epigenetic mechanisms. Recent pioneering discoveries from my lab have allowed us to develop the
model organism C. elegans to dissect the molecular mechanisms by which maternal stress, through the
serotonergic system, impacts chromatin in the pre-fertilized oocyte. Notwithstanding the differences between
the C. elegans and mammalian serotonergic systems (5-HT source being neurons, enterochromaffin cells and
maternal placenta in mammals and only neurons in C. elegans), an acute elevation of serotonin levels is a stress
signal in both mammals and C. elegans and acts through conserved receptor-mediated signal transduction
pathways to induce the ancient, conserved transcription factor, HSF1. Our working hypothesis, premised on
preliminary data, is that the stress-induced release of serotonin from maternal neurons in C. elegans enables
HSF1 to recruit chromatin remodeling proteins in a piRNA (21U-RNA)-dependent manner in the germline and
modify chromatin in pre-fertilized oocytes. The result is that threat perception by the mother alters the
development, behavior and physiology of future offspring. In Aim 1, we will identify the neural bases and
signaling mechanisms of the serotonergic defense survival circuit in the parent. In Aim 2, we will identify the
epigenetic changes in pre-fertilized germ cells caused by maternal serotonin, and understand how they impact
offspring neurodevelopment, behavior, and stress resilience.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Project Summary
Fibrotic liver disease is a growing public health concern significantly impacting the global population. Fibrotic
liver disease is often the result of sustained insults; chronic viral hepatitis B and C as well as NAFLD are the
most prevalent causes. While antiviral regimens for hepatitis B and C have decreased the viral cirrhosis burden,
other causes like NAFLD are increasingly prevalent, now affecting 14-27% of individuals in developed countries.
 Despite this high disease burden, there are currently no approved therapies. Rather, the lack of consensus
on optimal drug targets or strategies reflects a gap in our mechanistic understanding of disease drivers. Similarly,
the utility and clinical relevance of animal models is equally controversial. A multitude of models are currently
used, but each recapitulates only isolated aspects of human pathophysiology. There is an unmet need for
human-relevant systems that recapitulate key elements of fibrotic liver disease to enable mechanistic dissection.
 The measurable improvement in liver fibrosis in some but not all patients following successful antiviral
treatment reinforces the need for better understanding of fibrogenesis at a molecular level to aid development of
new treatments to prevent fibrosis or encourage regression. For NAFLD, despite identification of increasing
numbers of susceptibility-associated genetic variants and lifestyle-dependent risk factors, the mechanisms by
which they individually or synergistically contribute to disease progression remain largely unclear.
 The primary research goal of this proposal is to exploit a unique renewable and genetically manipulatable
human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived multicellular culture system to address the aforementioned gaps. In
this multicellular system, we coculture hPSC-derived hepatocytes, hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), and
macrophages in a manner that recapitulates the complexity of liver physiology in both health and disease.
Modeling hepatitis virus infection and NAFLD in the multicellular cultures, we found that both HCV infection and
a lipotoxic milieu induced inflammatory signals and stellate cell activation. A lipotoxic milieu also triggered other
features of NAFLD clinical phenotypes. Eliminating HCV reversed fibrosis-like phenotypes and treating with
obeticholic acid showed improvement in NAFLD-like features, as observed in the clinic.
 Across three aims, using cell and molecular approaches, we capitalize on the unique features of this novel
platform to address questions that cannot be adequately answered with any existing ex vivo human-relevant
system, including the roles of cytokines in HSC activation (Aim 1), the mechanisms of reversion after activation
(Aim 2) and the role of genetics and lifestyle-associated risk factors in NAFLD (Aim 3). Understanding the
molecular mechanisms of stellate cell activation and fibrosis development are critical for developing diagnostics
and designing new treatments to block fibrosis or promote regression. In addition, elucidating the mechanisms
of how genetic variants and risk factors contribute to liver disease progression may offer the opportunity to craft
targeted antifibrotic interventions optimized for particular patient subgroups.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Project Summary
The highly specialized intestinal immune system is charged with maintaining tolerance to harmless stimuli from
commensal bacteria and food, while providing protective immunity against pathogens. Dysregulation of this
critical balance can lead to inflammatory bowel disease, food allergy, or increased susceptibility to enteric
pathogens. CD4+ T cells are key players in intestinal homeostasis, finely tuning responses at the level of antigen
recognition and functional differentiation. In the intestinal epithelium (IE) and underlying lamina propria (LP),
tissue adapted pro-inflammatory (ie. Th17, Th1) and regulatory (Treg) and intraepithelial (CD8aa+ CD4IEL) CD4+
T cells coordinate immunity and tolerance to diverse intestinal stimuli. Nevertheless, it remains to be defined
how TCR repertoire and its specificity translate to function of both LP and IELs in response to microbial antigens.
Additionally, very little is known about the characteristics of dietary antigen-specific intestinal T cells. Oral
tolerance, a critical mechanism of gut homeostasis whereby oral administration of antigen results in both local
and systemic tolerance to that antigen, is known to depend on Tregs. However, the clonal dynamics of polyclonal
T cell responses in the setting of tolerance remain unclear. Finally, outside the context of immunization or allergy,
T cells that specifically recognize food protein have yet to be identified. Based on data recently published as well
as preliminary data obtained during the current funding cycle, we hypothesize that tissue cues combined with
TCR-driven signals from commensal microbes and food dictate intestinal T cell functional differentiation in steady
state, while disruption of normal T cell responses by infections or allergens results in inappropriate clonal
dynamics including expansion of pathological T cells. Aim 1 will define how stimulation by microbiota or enteric
viruses impact TCR repertoire and functional differentiation of intestinal CD4 T cells. Aim 2 will characterize the
role of dietary antigens in the context of tolerance, enteric infections, or food allergy, affect TCR repertoire and
functional differentiation of intestinal CD4 T cells. We combine single cell transcriptomics with a novel fate-
mapping strategy to selectively label peripheral T cells that are recruited to the intestine under various microbial
and dietary challenges. A recently developed LIPSTIC tool that allows intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) labeling
of interacting cells will be utilized to define potential mechanisms of IEL recruitment/expansion in response to
nonself stimuli. Recently generated murine strains with fixed TCR Vb chain, or that carry microbiota-specific
TCRs, combined with complementary tetramer and gnotobiotic strategies will be used to specifically track and
define recognition properties during T cell migration and differentiation in the gut. Novel “super-tetramer” and
dietary manipulations, combined with inflammatory challenges will be used to define food antigen-specific T cells
during steady state and how intestinal CD4+ T cell responses to dietary antigen are altered in a food allergic or
infection context. By combining these innovative approaches and concepts in mucosal immunology, this proposal
will help better defining the role of nonself antigen stimulation in T cell repertoire and function in the intestine.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：5-methylcytosine (m5C) is an important RNA modification studied mostly for its role in tRNA biology. However, its roles in other aspects of RNA biology remain understudied. Our preliminary results, using bisulfite treatment of RNA followed by high-throughput sequencing, show that the genomes of many RNA viruses are m5C methylated in a site-specific manner, including Sindbis virus (SINV), chikungunya virus (CHIKV) and Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3). The presence of m5C in diverse viruses, whose RNAs undergo many processes including translation, replication, transcription, and virion packaging, provides an attractive starting point for understanding the broader significance of this modification in regulating RNA function. A single dominant m5C site in SINV allowed us to generate an m5C-null mutant that exhibited cell-type dependent effects on virus replication. The host tRNA methyltransferase (MTase), NSUN2, which is important for host neuronal development and stem cell differentiation, appears to be the “writer” required for m5C modification of SINV. NSUN5, an MTase of ribosomal RNA is required for CVB3 methylation. We hypothesize that m5C plays a role in regulating viral RNA functions impacting virus-host interactions and viral life cycles. In three aims, using virologic, molecular, biochemical, high-throughput sequencing, and small animal model approaches: i) SINV will be exploited to learn how m5C is deposited and how it regulates RNA functions and viral infection and pathogenesis; studies of the related alphavirus CHIKV will allow conserved and virus-specific features to be uncovered, ii) how m5C regulates CVB3 RNA and what effects the modification has on virus replication and CVB3-associated myocarditis will be determined, and iii) SINV and CVB3 will be leveraged to characterize unknown functions of the NSUN2 and NSUN5 MTases, respectively, and as probes to discover novel m5C binding proteins that can exert their effect by direct binding (“readers”) or by removal of the m5C mark (“erasers”). This work will contribute to our understanding of human biology by revealing fundamental principles and functions of this widespread mark in the epitranscriptome with implications for its roles in maintaining cellular homeostasis. Since m5C methylation is a cellular process exploited by numerous viruses, this study could yield new targets for antiviral intervention.

 The current pandemic has highlighted fundamental gaps in our knowledge about the replication strategies
of coronaviruses, and how these are affected by the host at both the organismal and cellular level. There is a
pressing need to understand how SARS-CoV-2 infection and host-cell responses trigger such a diverse set of
pathologies, and the roles played by viral variation, host genetics and underlying preconditions. As studies of
SARS-CoV-2 frequently utilize population-based assays that look hours to days post infection, information on
cellular and spatial variability are lost. Furthermore, host responses are communicative spatial processes subject
to signaling gradients that vary between cells. Thus, averages over populations obscure heterogeneity and
spatial separations, and miss the earliest viral and host behaviors due to lack of sensitivity.
 To fill this gap, we developed experimental and computational approaches to quantify individual virion
entrance, establishment of the first replicative events, and production of viral RNAs and host responses in single
cells, all while maintaining sample spatial integrity. This project’s long-term objective is to apply this novel
approach to gain insights into SARS-CoV-2 biology distinct from those gleaned using traditional strategies. This
knowledge will provide new insight into the spectrum of COVID-19 disease outcomes and help guide future
therapeutic strategies.
 To this end, single-molecule in situ analyses, including single molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization
(smFISH) and multiplexed error-robust FISH (MERFISH) will be applied to the study of SARS-CoV-2. Aim 1 will
quantify SARS-CoV-2 entry, replication and spread, and host transcriptional responses in cells of varying tissue
origin. These data will be used to develop a stochastic computational model to address the determinants of early
viral replication and the resulting cellular response. Aim 2 will examine the effect of host mutations or pre-existing
conditions that affect the type I interferon (IFN) response and have been associated with severe COVID-19, as
well as emerging viral Variants of Concern. Aim 3 will model patient comorbidities in vivo using mouse models
of SARS-CoV-2 infection, identifying the functional and spatial consequences of host responses, including IFN
and other cytokine expression, in the respiratory tract and lung. We will further utilize these in vivo models to
understand why pathogenesis and disease outcome differ depending on the inoculum dose and the age of the
animal. Together, our multidisciplinary approach utilizing techniques and information from systems-level virology,
spatial transcriptomics, host genetics, computational biology, and innate immunity provides a powerful means of
probing questions central to understanding clinical outcome and informing life-saving interventions.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Encephalitic flavivirus infections affect thousands of people globally every year causing acute encephalomyelitis and placing significant burden on healthcare systems. Currently, no virus-specific treatments are available for these life-threatening conditions. The central nervous system (CNS) encompasses dozens of cell types with diverse properties and functions. Limited by a lack of adequate tools that combine throughput, depth and resolution, the interactions between viruses and this complex environment remain largely a mystery. To complicate matters, the CNS is also extensively connected to the periphery by both physical neural projections and peripheral immune signaling. Our preliminary studies demonstrate that tropism of the important encephalitic virus West Nile (WNV) within the CNS after direct intracranial inoculation of mice differs from that seen after spread to the CNS following peripheral infection. We hypothesize that CNS tropism is largely determined by resident neural and glial innate immune profiles, which can be readily modified by immune signals generated during peripheral infection. To address this hypothesis, we will utilize WNV to study immune interactions between cell types in an in vivo mouse model and in vitro using human induced pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) models. Tissue clearing techniques and whole mount imaging will be used to visualize viral antigens across the entire brain and spinal cord using light sheet microscopy, creating a complete time-resolved 3-dimensional map of infection. Responses of single cells will be examined using a combination of cutting-edge nuclear RNA sequencing and microscopy-based spatial transcriptomics. Co-cultures of hPSC-derived neurons and glia will be interrogated using high-throughput microscopy and sequencing to identify resistance factors and responses in human cell types. Hits will be mechanistically studied using blocking antibodies and CRISPR-mediated knockouts. Lastly, by using systemic and cell-type specific knock out animals or cytokine neutralizing antibodies, we will investigate the role of type I interferon in modulating CNS tropism and disease. This project will provide new data on flaviviral encephalitis at unparalleled resolution to help bridge current information gaps and improve fundamental knowledge by defining cellular tropism and CNS inflammatory responses at the single cell level and evaluating how changes in peripheral signaling influence infection of the brain. Identified peripheral factors restricting CNS infection are possible targets for immunomodulatory therapy, thus promoting research that may improve treatment for other forms of viral encephalitis. Finally, the resulting experimental pipeline will be broadly applicable to the study of CNS stress and inflammation, with relevance to other diseases like Lyme neuroborreliosis or chronic debilitating conditions like traumatic brain injury.

 More than 250 million people are chronically infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV), living at increased
risk of liver failure, cancer, and early death. Though there is a vaccine to prevent HBV infection, it does not
prevent vertical transfer, nor does it help the millions of people already infected. While there are therapies (e.g.
nucleoside analogs) to suppress virus replication, treatment is life-long and rarely leads to cure. Achieving a
functional cure for chronic HBV infection therefore represents a major global unmet medical need.
 Fortunately, new classes of HBV inhibitors are being developed and some have already entered clinical
trials, but many fundamental (and clinically-relevant) aspects of HBV biology remain unanswered. The broad
long-term objectives of this project are to address knowledge gaps in the field using a new cell culture-based
method we developed to initiate HBV replication with RNA. Specifically, we capitalize on the most unique
features of this technology to (i) address a practical problem of drug development—antiviral resistance, (ii) to
fill gaps in our fundamental knowledge of HBV protein translation and genome replication, and (iii) as a
discovery tool to identify host factors that restrict or promote the HBV lifecycle.
 There is currently no way to assess antiviral resistance with existing HBV cell culture-based systems.
With our RNA approach, we take advantage of the fact that phage polymerases (e.g. T7) commonly used to in
vitro-transcribe RNA are error-prone. As such, initiating HBV replication with RNA rather than DNA (like most
systems) allows a diverse population of viral variants to be sampled. As we show with compelling preliminary
data, this sequence diversity coupled with deep sequencing technology makes it possible to select for and
detect rare HBV drug-resistant viral variants. Aim 1 of this proposal is to further develop this technology.
 Initiating HBV replication with RNA largely eliminates the background signal that contaminates HBV
qPCR reactions, and since not all viral RNAs are required to initiate replication, some viral proteins are made
only if the viral lifecycle progresses and the viral DNA template—covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA)—is
established. We capitalize on this in Aim 2 to study fundamental aspects of HBV protein translation and
genome replication, and in Aim 3 to discover virus-host interactions. Specifically we use the method in Aim 2 to
study mutations that frequently arise in chronically infected individuals and differences in HBV genotypes. We
use the method in Aim 3 as the basis for a genome-wide CRISPR knockout screen to identify HBV host factors.
 Until we have a solution for eliminating chronic HBV, continuing and new fundamental studies of HBV
biology are needed to identify new strategies that can be explored for therapeutic intervention. The new RNA-
based system we developed to study HBV biology and assess antiviral resistance align well with the NIH's
strategic plan to cure chronic HBV and the work we propose will contribute significantly to this ongoing effort.

 A functional immune system is central to human health and, at the same time, alterations of normal lymphoid
developmental programs can lead to immune deficiencies, autoimmune diseases and a variety of lymphomas.
Germinal centers (GCs) are microanatomical structures formed in secondary lymphoid organs during antigen-
stimulated immune responses. GCs are the sites of B cell maturation through clonal expansion, somatic
hypermutation, and affinity-mediated selection -- and therefore play a critical role in differentiation of antibody
secreting cells and memory B cells. OCA-B is a unique transcriptional coactivator that is highly expressed in GC
B cells and GC-derived lymphomas such as diffuse large B cell lymphoma and Burkitt’s lymphoma. In vivo
studies have demonstrated that OCA-B is essential for both antigen-dependent B cell differentiation (including
GC formation) and normal expression of secondary immunoglobulin genes. However, little is known about the
exact role of OCA-B in normal GC formation and GC-derived lymphoma progression. In addition, the mechanism
by which OCA-B regulates its target genes is also unclear. In addressing these issues, our preliminary studies
have demonstrated (i) a functional occupancy of OCA-B on distal enhancers, in particular the large locus control
region (LCR) of the BCL6 gene that encodes a master regulator of GC formation; (ii) direct interactions of OCA-
B with the MED1 subunit of the Mediator coactivator complex and with a GC-specific transcription factor (MEF2B)
important for BCL6 expression and (iii) a B cell-intrinsic Oca-B dependency for GC B cell differentiation in vivo.
 Based on our previous OCA-B studies and recent preliminary data, we hypothesize that a predominant role
of OCA-B in GC formation involves activation of BCL6 through its distal enhancer region by recruiting and
concentrating transcription factors and cofactors, including chromatin/epigenetic factors, that facilitate enhancer-
promoter interactions. We also hypothesis that OCA-B plays a critical role in GC-derived lymphomagenesis. To
address these issues, we will investigate (i) the function and mechanism of action of OCA-B, through interactions
with MED1/Mediator and MEF2B, on the BCL6 LCR/super-enhancer in both ex vivo GC B and lymphoma cells,
(ii) the mechanism of action of OCA-B-dependent transcriptional coactivation through rigorous biochemical in
vitro transcription assays; (iii) the mechanism of action of OCA-B in GC B cell differentiation in vivo, including
identification of key target genes and regulatory networks; (iv) the role of OCA-B in B cell lymphoma progression
in vivo. We will use complementary biochemical, genomic, bioinformatic, genetic, gene-editing, cell-based and
in vivo (mouse model) approaches. Completion of these aims will advance our understanding of the molecular
mechanism of action of OCA-B in GC-specific transcriptional regulation, GC B cell differentiation, and GC-
derived B cell lymphomagenesis. Notably, it also will provide clues to new therapeutic strategies for treating B
cell lymphomas.

Epidermodysplasia verruciformis (EV) was the first described primary immunodeficiency (PID). By 1946, it was
shown by Lutz to be an autosomal recessive (AR) predisposition to skin-tropic viruses, prior to the description of
congenital neutropenia by Kostmann (1950). Its lack of associated immunological phenotypes long prevented its
recognition as a PID. EV is characterized by disseminated and persistent flat warts, which often evolve into skin
cancer. The lesions are caused by E5- and E8-deficient members of the β genus of human papillomaviruses
(HPVs), which exclusively reside in keratinocytes and remain silent in the general population. EV typically strikes
otherwise healthy individuals (“isolated EV”), or rarely occurs in the context of other infectious diseases
(“syndromic EV”). In 2002, bi-allelic mutations in TMC6 and TMC8, encoding EVER1 and EVER2, were found in
patients with isolated EV, whose T cells were normal. Bi-allelic mutations in CIB1 were reported in 2018 in other
patients with isolated EV. Remarkably, CIB1, EVER1, and EVER2 form a complex that binds to E5 and E8. This
complex operates as a restriction factor governing keratinocyte-intrinsic immunity to β-HPVs. From 2012 onward,
mutations in RHOH, STK4, and other T cell genes were found in patients with syndromic EV. We hypothesize
that other, related single-gene inborn errors of cutaneous immunity against β-HPVs, underlie EV in other patients.
The goal of this application is thus to analyze in greater depth the molecular and cellular basis of isolated and
syndromic EV. First, we will discover new genetic etiologies of EV thanks to the ongoing recruitment of unrelated
EV families, by combining genome-wide linkage (GWL) and whole exome sequencing (WES). Second, we will
functionally characterize the novel genotypes by studying the mutant proteins in isolation and in the patients’
cells, including their relationship with the products of the known EV-causing genes, such as the EVER-CIB1
complex in keratinocytes and RhoH or STK4 in T cells. Third, we will model HPV infection of keratinocytes in the
presence of T cells in vitro, with viral proteins and particles, using keratinocyte cell lines, foreskin keratinocytes,
the patients’ keratinocytes, or induced pluripotent step cell (iPSC)-derived keratinocytes, which will be edited by
CRISPR/Cas9. Our project is highly innovative yet supported by strong preliminary data. Indeed, we have
recruited 52 novel families, identified three novel genetic etiologies, underlying isolated (mutations in RBPJ) or
syndromic EV (ITGAL and OX40), and began elucidating their mechanistic connection with keratinocytes and T
cells, respectively. Our research provides novel insights into the mechanisms of cutaneous immunity to β-HPVs,
highlighting the dual contribution of keratinocyte-intrinsic immunity and T-cell adaptive immunity. Our research
benefits EV patients and families, with the development of novel diagnostic approaches, including genetic
counseling, and facilitating the development of novel therapeutic approaches based on a rational understanding
of the pathogenesis. Finally, the study of EV is a fruitful model to analyze other mucosal and cutaneous illnesses
caused by other HPVs.

Chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis (CMC) is characterized by lesions of the nails, skin, and oral and genital
mucosae by the fungus Candida albicans. Autosomal recessive (AR) IL-17RA, IL-17RC, and ACT1 deficiencies,
and autosomal dominant (AD) IL-17F deficiency underlie ‘isolated CMC’, while AR CARD9, ROR-g/gT, ZNF341,
IL-12p40, and IL-12Rβ1 deficiencies, AD STAT3, IL6ST/GP130, and JNK1 deficiencies, and AD STAT1 gain-of-
function (GOF) underlie ‘syndromic CMC’. Cells with IL-17RA, IL-17RC, ACT1, or JNK1 deficiency respond poorly
to IL-17A and IL-17F. Cells with IL-17RA or ACT1 deficiency also respond poorly to IL-17E (IL-25). Patients with
ROR-g/gT, ZNF341, STAT3, IL6ST, or JNK1 deficiency, or STAT1 GOF, display low proportions of IL-17A/IL-17F
(IL-17A/F)-producing T cells. Since 2008, we have made major contributions to these discoveries that causally
connected inborn errors of IL-17 immunity with CMC. Three outstanding enigmas are (i) the mechanisms by which
STAT1 mutations can be GOF and by which they impair the development of IL-17 T cells, (ii) the mechanisms by
which inborn errors of STAT3 that impair IL-17 production underlie CMC, while inborn errors of STAT3-activating
cytokines IL-6, IL-21, and IL-23 apparently do not, and (iii) the genetic etiology of about half of the patients with
isolated or syndromic CMC. We first intend to test the hypotheses that (a) STAT1 GOF mutations impair the
dephosphorylation of nuclear STAT1 by disrupting the formation of antiparallel dimers, thereby preventing the
accessibility of specific phosphatases, and that (b) excessive responses of T cells to IFN-a, IFN-g, and IL-27
collectively impair the development of Th17 cells. We then intend to analyze the production of IL-17 cytokines by
leukocytes from patients with IL-6R, IL-21R, or IL-23R deficiency, in comparison with known etiologies of CMC,
testing the hypothesis that the isolated disruption of IL-6, IL-21, or IL-23 only weakly impairs the development of
Th17 and related IL-17-producing lymphocytes. We finally intend to discover novel CMC-causing genes using
genome-wide (GW) approaches, based on GW linkage (GWL), and whole-exome or whole-genome sequencing
(WES/WGS). On the three fronts, we have exciting preliminary results. We found (i) that all STAT1 variants tested
are GOF due to impaired dephosphorylation by the tyrosine phosphatases TC-PTP and PTP1B, by disruption of
antiparallel dimers formation; and the concomitant addition of STAT1-dependent cytokines IFN-a/b, IFN-g, and
IL-27 inhibits the development of IL-17 T cells from naïve CD4+ T cells with STAT1 GOF; (ii) patients with AR IL-
6R or IL-23R deficiency and CMC, implying incomplete penetrance; and (iii) patients with syndromic CMC and
mutations of cRel, RelB, MAP3K6 (also known as ASK2), ZNF375 (zDHHC5), or UBASH3B (TULA-2). From a
biological standpoint, this research will provide new insights into the mechanisms of mucocutaneous immunity to
fungi, while dissecting the molecular and cellular control of human IL-17. From a clinical angle, this work will
provide new molecular diagnoses for patients and genetic counseling for families, while paving the way for new
cytokine-based approaches in patients with CMC.

Generating an appropriate antibody response is critical for protection against reinfection and for the effectiveness
of vaccination, particularly in the context of viral diseases. In addition to well-studied quantitative parameters
such as antibody titer and affinity, other, more qualitative parameters related to the clonal composition of the
response also play critical roles in antibody-mediated protection. These include antigen and epitope specificity,
which is key to viral neutralization capacity and antibody breadth, and overall clonal diversity, which strongly
influences the degree of immunodominance and therefore the ability of viruses to escape immunity by mutation.
Despite their importance, such “ecological” aspects of GC biology remain poorly understood and systematically
understudied at the mechanistic level.
Our long-term goal is to develop a mechanistic understanding of how the competitive waxing and waning of B
cell clones at the various stages of the immune response shapes the ultimate composition, specificity, and
protective efficacy of serum antibody. In our previous studies, using multicolor “Brainbow”-based B cell fate-
mapping models, we focused on the germinal center (GC) and memory phases of the response, revealing how
highly diverse early responders are funneled towards oligoclonality, first progressively by GC selection (including
in chronic gut-associated GC) and then dramatically by secondary boosting. We now propose to extend our work
using these same tools to investigate the clonal dynamics of prolonged selection in long-lived virus-induced GCs
(Aim 1) and of the progressive differentiation of plasmablasts and plasma cells from GC precursors (Aim 2). We
also propose a new “molecular fate-mapping” system to determine how clonal dynamics impact the ultimate
composition of serum antibody (Aim 3). This allows us to investigate the B cell biology of serum-level phenomena
such as antigenic imprinting/original antigenic sin, immunodominance, and viral escape.
We expect our findings will provide greater mechanistic understanding of how the composition and protective
effectiveness of serum antibody is determined by the dynamics of B cell clonal competition, with implications for
the design of effective vaccination strategies for influenza, HIV, and SARS-CoV-2.

Insects are the primary vectors for many deadly diseases. Mosquitoes and other biting insects rely on their
exquisite sense of smell to identify and hone in on their human hosts. Consequently, one strategy to control the
transmission of insect-borne diseases is to target insect olfactory receptors, disrupt the initial detection of
human volatiles, and prevent insects from locating humans. The goal of developing potent insect repellents that
cripple host-seeking behavior is greatly facilitated by the unique molecular nature of insect olfactory receptors.
Insect olfactory receptors form a novel class of heteromeric ion channels comprised of two distinct subunits—a
highly divergent odorant receptor (OR) subunit that confers odorant specificity and a common Orco subunit,
that is virtually invariant amongst diverse insect species, reflecting its essential role in olfactory transduction.
Given the conserved and critical role that Orco plays in odor detection, it forms an ideal molecular target for a
much-needed new generation of insect repellents with the potential to halt the transmission of insect-borne
diseases. Unfortunately, as these receptors represent a unique specialization of insects and lack structural
homology to any other ion channel family, many of their most elementary structural and functional properties
have remained elusive, precluding sufficient mechanistic understanding to guide repellent design. To fill this
important void in the field, my lab recently determined the structure of an Orco homomeric channel using cryo-
electron microscopy, providing the first structural snapshot of an insect olfactory receptor. Building on this
advance and our expertise in odorant receptor biochemistry, we propose to elucidate the structure of Orco in
conditions that replicate its native environment: embedded within a lipid membrane (Aim 1) and assembled
with an OR to form a heteromeric channel (Aim 2), alone and in complex with synthetic agonists and odorants.
Revealing multiple structures of insect olfactory receptors in both apo and ligand bound states will provide
direct insight into the structural and mechanistic basis for their allosteric modulation. Together, the proposed
studies offer a unique and powerful inroad to the rational design of small-molecule repellents that disrupt odor
detection and host-seeking behavior in insect vectors of human disease.

Adult neurogenesis is emerging as an important player in maintaining brain homeostasis and normal functions.
The dysfunctions of neurogenesis have been associated with aging and neurological disorders, including
Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The ability to systematically map the molecular dynamics of neurogenesis at single-
cell resolution could serve as a foundation for a systematic effort to better understand the molecular events that
give rise to abnormal cell states in aging and diseases. While the rapid advances in single-cell genomics are
creating unprecedented opportunities to explore molecular heterogeneity in mammalian brains, nearly all such
methods are restricted to low throughput and fail to recover the heterogeneity and dynamics of the profoundly
rare cell states in adult neurogenesis (e.g., less than 0.1% of the cell population in the brain). Herein, we propose
to develop novel methodologies that enable a comprehensive view of temporal-spatial dynamics of neurogenesis
during aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD) in both human and mouse brains. Specifically, we will first develop a
novel high-throughput, low-cost single-cell genomics approach, sciNext1000, to profile the molecular
heterogeneity of four million cells from post-mortem human hippocampal samples. This approach will be powerful
because we can not only quantitatively characterize the frequency of human adult hippocampal neurogenesis at
single-cell resolution, but also identify the transcriptome features associated with impaired neurogenesis in aging
and AD at isoform resolution. In addition, we will develop another novel single-cell genomic technique, sci-Div-
seq, to enhance the detection of newborn neurons, and identify the cellular differentiation trajectories and
associated transcriptomic features of adult neurogenesis in young and aged mouse brains. The resulting dataset
will advance our understanding of gene regulation in neurogenesis across different neural lineages and
constitute a significant step towards a comprehensive characterization of the molecular mechanism underlying
neurogenesis impairment in aging. In addition to the internal molecular programs, the neurogenesis process is
controlled by aspects of environmental signals from the neural stem niche. We will apply a high-throughput
spatial transcriptomic strategy to identify the cellular interactions and local microenvironment involved in adult
neurogenesis in both human and mouse brains. These multi-pronged approaches will open a new paradigm for
understanding the global molecular programs and environmental regulation of adult neurogenesis, thereby
informing potential therapeutic targets to restore cell population homeostasis in aging and brain disorders.

Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a chronic psychiatric disorder with severe societal consequences that impacts
over 15 million adults in the USA and 76 million worldwide. Ethanol exposure early in life, particularly in utero,
strikingly alters fetal brain development and increases the risk for AUD. Even exposure to low concentrations of
ethanol can produce the most prevalent, milder forms of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder. Our recent studies in
the rat demonstrate that prenatal exposure to low levels of ethanol, in addition to increasing ethanol consumption
and anxiety in the offspring, stimulates neurogenesis with negligible cytotoxic effects. Interestingly, prenatal
ethanol stimulates the density of neurons expressing hypocretin/orexin (Hcrt), an orexigenic neuropeptide
located almost exclusively in the hypothalamus that has a major role in promoting AUD-related behaviors. These
compelling effects observed in our rodent model led us to seek a simpler vertebrate model to investigate in real-
time, at cellular and anatomical levels, the mechanisms involved in ethanol’s effects on embryonic development
of Hcrt neurons. The zebrafish (ZF) is a perfect vertebrate model system for our studies, due to its optical
accessibility and external development, its small size and low cost, and its comparable CNS that develops early
and rapidly alongside a relatively sophisticated behavioral repertoire. With our recent publications showing a
conservation of ethanol’s effects across species, we established in our laboratory a variety of techniques
particularly suited for comprehensive studies of the ZF brain, including time-lapse live imaging, optogenetics,
calcium imaging, and in vivo targeted laser ablation, and obtained preliminary results revealing robust and
unexpected changes in Hcrt neurons and neuroimmune systems that may lead to the formation of specific
asymmetric Hcrt subpopulations. Based on these new findings, we propose to test the following hypothesis:
Embryonic exposure to ethanol at low doses has diverse effects on the development of Hcrt neurons, which are
mediated by dynamic changes in local inflammatory chemokine systems and contribute to the formation of
asymmetric, abnormally-located Hcrt subpopulations that exhibit altered neural activity and are causally related
to disturbances in ethanol consumption and associated behaviors. In 3 specific aims, we plan in ZF embryonically
exposed to low-dose ethanol: 1) to thoroughly characterize Hcrt neuronal development along with behavior,
under normal conditions and after ethanol exposure, and directly test the behavioral functions of these neurons;
2) to precisely determine, at a single-cell level, if Hcrt neurons in specific subpopulations are unique in their birth
date, site of origin, migratory path, and signaling activity, and if they are causally related to behavioral
disturbances; and 3) to test the possibility that effects of embryonic ethanol on Hcrt neuronal development and
behavior are mediated by local neuroimmune systems, specifically CXCL12a/CXCR4b/CXCR7b and
CCL2/CCR2. This research aims to elucidate in depth the dynamic and diverse neuropeptide, neuroimmune and
behavioral changes caused by low levels of in utero ethanol exposure that increase the risk for AUD.

Squamous cell carcinoma is a major cause of death worldwide. Despite advances in cancer genetics, alterations
in post-translational modifications are poorly understood. Protein glycosylation is the most abundant PTM and
altered in cancer. Glycans are not directly encoded in the genome but rather are comprised of up to ten
monosaccharides in various linkages to form thousands of structures, making their structural and functional
characterization challenging and largely unknown in SCC. To address this, I propose to use murine skin as a
highly tractable model system to study altered glycosylation, downstream consequences, and identify novel
therapies. In the K99, I will use glycan binding proteins, metabolic labeling, advanced microscopy, MALDI
imaging, glycomics, glycoproteomics, and single cell transcriptomics to spatially map glycosylation and identify
specific glycan and glycoprotein changes in a genetic, multi-hit, histologically progressive model of SCC from
papilloma to SCC, before chemotherapy, and after recurrence (Aim I). Next in the K99, I will use our in utero
lentivirus technology to transduce epidermis and perform a large-scale, unbiased, in vivo, functional genomics
screen of the ~700 glycogenes to define the role of glycosylation in SCC (Aim II). Lastly in the R00, I will combine
glycoproteomics, single cell transcriptomics of the tumor and microenvironment, protein-specific glycan editing,
and high-throughput drug screens to identify mechanisms of glycan-driven tumorigenesis and novel therapeutic
candidates (Aim III). My background in glycobiology, medical oncology, and mentorship from leading skin and
cancer biologist Dr. Elaine Fuchs at the outstanding training environments at Rockefeller University and
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, as a postdoctoral and medical oncology fellow, will position me to
tackle these important questions and learn techniques, knowledge, and leadership to establish a career as a
leading independent investigator and physician-scientist in cancer glycobiology.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The long-term goal of our research is to decipher the essential molecular mechanisms underlying successful cell
division. Errors in this process have been linked to developmental defects and diseases such as cancer. We
now know essentially every protein needed for cell division. However, analyzing the precise molecular
mechanisms needed for error-free division has continued to be very challenging for at least three reasons. First,
cell division in human cells is a highly dynamic process that can be completed in <1 hour, with key steps such
as chromosome-microtubule attachments and nuclear envelop reformation taking only a few minutes. Second,
the microtubule-based structures that dynamically self-assemble and function in dividing cells can be ~1000-
times larger than their nanometer-sized protein components. Third, this multi-step process depends on several
distinct protein-protein interactions that can be transient and mitosis-specific. To address these challenges and
fill gaps in our knowledge we have: (i) Discovered and characterized cell-permeable chemical inhibitors of key
mechanoenzymes (e.g. AAA, ATPases associated with diverse cell processes). These chemical probes can be
used to rapidly (typically, within minutes) inhibit or activate (through relief from inhibition) protein function in
dividing human cells. We combine these fast perturbations with state-of-the-art microscopy (e.g. lattice light-
sheet microscopy) and quantitative image analysis to dissect mechanisms underlying cell division dynamics in
human cells. To identify target-specific phenotypes we carry out parallel inhibitor dose-dependent analyses in
matched cell lines that are either inhibitor-sensitive or -resistant. (ii) Deciphered how micrometer-sized features
(e.g. microtubule length or overlap length) can effectively be measured by nanometer-sized proteins to generate
proportionate outputs (e.g. tags or force). For these studies we have generated a biochemical ‘toolbox’
comprised of recombinant forms of the augmin complex, isotypically-pure human tubulin, key microtubule-
associated motor and non-motor proteins and g-TuRC (g -tubulin ring complex), the major microtubule nucleator
in human cells. (iii) Developed and applied chemical proteomics approaches to ‘capture’ and profile direct,
transient and context-dependent protein-protein interactions in living cells. The research proposed benefits from
our expertise and will combine chemical, structural and cell biology approaches to answer long-standing
questions, including: (a) What are the functions of different AAA mechanoenzymes during cell division and how
are their activities regulated? (b) What is the structural basis of g-TuRC-dependent microtubule nucleation and
how does this complex contribute to centrosome-dependent and -independent microtubule formation during
mitosis? Our research should provide new insights into fundamental mechanisms, uncover general principles
that inform on other cellular processes (e.g. microtubule organization in neurons), and may provide starting
points for developing new therapeutics.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), is an ongoing global health crisis. The WHO
reports 10 million active cases and over 1.5 million deaths annually. RNA polymerase (RNAP), the enzyme
responsible for all transcription in bacteria, is the target for rifampicin, a first-line treatment for TB. RNAP is thus
a proven and attractive target for developing new drugs. These facts highlight the importance of our recent
structural and functional characterization of Mtb RNAP, and the essential transcription factors required for full
transcriptional activity and intrinsic antibiotic resistance. In addition, we have found that studying diverse clades
of bacteria deepens our understanding of general principles of transcription. Therefore, we study Actinobacteria,
as the biophysical and molecular mechanisms of transcription in this clade are relatively understudied and
because it includes important pathogens.
We determined high-resolution cryo-EM structures of several Mtb initiation transcription complexes with essential
transcription factors and important antibiotics in the previous funding period. Here my vision is to complete the
characterization of initiation regulation and expand our focus to the post-initiation steps throughout the
transcription cycle. These steps include elongation, pausing (a regulatory step where the RNAP temporarily halts
at specific sequences, permitting input from diverse signals), and termination. We will also continue
characterizing new RNAP inhibitors.
To complete our understanding of initiation, we will continue our studies of the WhiB factors, focusing on the
essential factor WhiB1, which is required for Mtb viability and response to stress. To characterize post-initiation
steps, we plan to study the mechanisms of mycobacterial NusA and NusG. NusG in Mycobacteria increases
transcriptional pausing and termination, yet it suppresses both in the well-characterized E. coli. This difference
in activity emphasizes the need to study these factors in other clades of bacteria. Most of these studies will
involve single-particle cryo-EM, but we plan to extend our studies in situ by using cryo-electron tomography to
investigate cellular processes and organizations, such as ribosomal coupling to RNAP. To rigorously study how
transcription factors act genome-wide, we will finish developing cell-free genomics: using genomic DNA as a
substrate for purified RNAP and transcription factors, and quantifying resultant transcripts with RNA-seq. This
method is necessary to identify native DNA sequences regulated by essential factors WhiB1, NusA, and NusG,
whose regulons have remained elusive due to pleiotropy upon perturbation in cells.
In sum, I envision using a multidisciplinary approach that includes structural, genetic, biochemical, genomic, and
in situ experiments to understand the roles and mechanisms of each step in the transcription cycle and how they
are regulated by cis and trans-acting elements. The results from this proposal have the potential to elucidate the
molecular and biological mechanisms of the entire transcription cycle.

A major challenge in understanding how organs take shape is addressing how increases in morphological
complexity arise. Over the past half-century, our understanding of such symmetry-breaking has been
predominantly developed through molecular, genetic, and cellular frameworks. However, symmetry-breaking in
developing organs occurs at scales far larger than their individual molecular and cellular constituents, prompting
the question of how events at the molecular and cellular scale relate to the physical self-organization of organ
structure. To address this question, my lab centers its studies on the behavior of cell collectives, an understudied
nexus that serves as a mediator between subcellular processes and functionally relevant organ morphology. Our
prior work in considering collective cell, or supracellular, material properties has led to the hypothesis that the
role of key signals, known as morphogens, in sculpting organs is to influence cells and extracellular matrix such
that tissue material properties or “phase” are modulated. Thus, a key functional role of morphogens may be to
create diversity in supracellular mechanical behavior by fluidizing or solidifying tissue domains that result in the
increase of complexity in organ form. Here we will use a unique set of supracellular behavioral assays to
investigate new roles for signals in shaping emerging morphologies. We will first link where and when
morphogens are expressed in the forming follicle to the transcriptional profiles and multicellular architectures
that accompany morphogen activity (Aim 1). We will then leverage a constellation of novel collective cell
mechanics platforms to probe the functional consequence of morphogen activity at the supracellular scale. (Aim
2). Finally, through the integration of theory and experiment, we will explore the hypothesis that interacting
supracellular phases generate a mechanical instability in the skin that is sufficient to shape the organ (Aim 3).
Together these studies stand to highlight the need to consider supracellular properties necessary for tissue
symmetry breaking that are not reducible to the properties of individual cells. At the same time, our studies will
identify the molecular and cellular component parts that enable the diversification of emergent supracellular
material properties. Our investigations will pave the way for a generalizable paradigm for how morphogens can
create adjacent material phases within a single tissue, thereby generating the potential for mechanical self-
organization at the tissue scale. Finally, these studies will shed light on the multi-scale nature of organ formation
and serve as a foundation for future work aimed at addressing congenital defects, engineering stromal tissues
of specific material properties, and the rational channeling supracellular self-organizing potential in regenerative
medicine.

Innate behaviors are hard-wired and shared among most mammals, however, it is still not fully understood how
these behaviors arise and what neuronal mechanisms control behavior selection. The goal of this proposal is
to study feeding behavior as a typical innate behavior to determine the fundamentals of a circuit that connects
sensing of the body’s energy state to motor centers for food consumption. This will be done using an
integrative approach at behavior, circuit, neuron and synapse level that takes advantage of my existing
and proposed training in neuroscience. Results will shed light on the neuronal computations that
transform sensations of energy state into motor sequences of chewing and biting and will advance our
understanding of behavior selection.
Feeding behavior is elicited by changes in bodily energy state (fasted vs. fed) that result in jaw movements of
chewing and biting. In contrast to other behaviors, the motor and premotor neurons for jaw muscles are located
in the brain and not the spine. Thus, the arc from hunger sensation to motor control is fully brain-based. I
previously identified a simple circuit for food consumption that connects neurons sensitive to signals of bodily
energy state via only one intermediate node to premotor areas controlling biting and chewing. Building on this
data, the mentored phase aims to delineate the role of premotor neurons and their activity patterns with
respect to the hypothesis that premotor neurons are structured in a motor map for bite purposes. This aim
aligns with my training plan to gain expertise in RNA profiling and single cell calcium imaging through my
advisory committee and the high-quality scientific core and support opportunities at Rockefeller University.
Additionally, I will also take advantage of the career development and lab management training opportunities
offered locally and by the Tri-Institute area. Next, during the independent phase, I will use these skills to
elucidate the computations that lead to the behavior selection of feeding and the effect of internal sensations of
energy state change. Specifically, it will be determined how competing behaviors (social interactions, fear) can
suppress feeding and how integration of food-derived sensations (sight, smell) and bodily signals causes food
consumption. This phase is the logical extension of my extensive training in neuroscience and my career
objectives to lead my own research group for which this proposal forms the basis of my research direction.
Results from this study will shed light on the conceptual principles of how innate behaviors are encoded along
a simple sensory to motor circuit. Additionally, results will also provide insight into the mechanisms of energy
state coupling with food intake which has important implications for obesity and eating disorders. Finally, this
proposal will equip me with the training and initial data needed to start an independent research program that
is different from my mentors and aligned with my career goals of studying innate behavior in the context of
interoception.

Liver cancer is the third leading cause of cancer-related death and is associated with diverse range of oncogenic
alterations. These driver mutations impact clinical outcomes, disease prognosis and response to therapy.
Treatment options for liver cancer include a few multi-kinase inhibitors and surgical resection, providing only
limited survival benefits. To this end, genotype-guided therapeutic approaches are urgently needed in clinics.
Metabolism-focused approaches have recently gained interest to be explored as anti-cancer therapy. However,
it is poorly understood how specific oncogenic alterations impact tumor metabolism and which tumors would
benefit from metabolism-based therapies. Given the complex cellular and nutritional composition of tumors,
studying tumor metabolism at cellular resolution is quite challenging. In this study, I propose a way to overcome
this challenge by employing an organelle pull-down technology and profiling mitochondrial metabolites of cancer
cells from highly heterogeneous tumor tissues. In my preliminary work, I focused on mitochondria, a central
biosynthetic hub for cellular metabolism, applied the mitochondrial immunoprecipitation method (mito-IP) to
capture cancer cell mitochondria from in vivo transformed liver tumors driven by different oncogenic alterations,
including c-MYC; p53-/- and KrasG12D; p53-/-. This approach enabled mitochondrial metabolite profiling by LC/MS
and identified metabolite changes specific to each oncogenic alteration. In particular, I found enrichment of
creatine metabolism intermediates; guanidinoacetate, creatine (Cr) and phosphocreatine (P-Cr), specifically in
KrasG12D tumors. Mitochondrial proteomics corroborated these findings, revealed upregulation of Gatm, the rate
limiting enzyme in creatine biosynthesis, in KrasG12D tumors. Building upon these findings, in this proposal, I will
test the central hypothesis that oncogenes impose distinct metabolic alterations in mitochondria, which can be
exploited as targeted therapies. I will first test the essentiality of creatine metabolism for KrasG12D -mutant liver
tumor growth. Then, I will determine the precise mechanisms by which creatine metabolism contributes to
KrasG12D-driven tumorigenesis. Finally, given the success of my in vivo mito-IP approach, I will model frequent
liver cancer mutations to map differentially regulated mitochondrial metabolites and proteins, and identify limiting
metabolic reactions through unbiased genetic screens. By addressing the aims of this proposal, we will gain
mechanistic insight into downstream metabolic effects of oncogenic alterations and potential of genotype-
targeted metabolic therapies for targeting liver cancer. Collectively, these aims will provide foundations of my
future research program committed to understanding how oncogenes (genetic determinants) alter cancer cell
metabolism in vivo, with the goal of exploiting such alterations for genotype-targeted metabolic therapies.

The eukaryotic cell has evolved to compartmentalize DNA within the nucleus, surrounded by the barrier of the
nuclear envelope (NE), providing protection to the DNA and a means to control information flow to and from the
genome. This flow, namely the passage of small molecules, RNAs, and proteins across the NE, is mediated by
large, 8-fold symmetrical structures known as nuclear pore complexes (NPCs). Arranged as a stack of rings, the
NPC scaffold braces open pores within the NE, yet preserves its barrier function with a dense network of
disordered protein domains, rich in repeating phenylalanine-glycine motifs (FG repeats), known as the NPC
central transporter. The largest NPC cargoes, including pre-ribosomal subunits, mRNPs, and proteasome
subcomplexes, approach the width of the ~55 nm NPC channel in size, yet are able to transit the NPC central
transporter. That such large cargoes can traverse the NPC suggests that organized mechanisms and alternate
structural states of the NPC are required to transport large cargoes through the FG repeat network of the central
transporter. To address these questions, our multi-investigator, multi-site collaborative team recently determined
structures of the affinity isolated S. cerevisiae budding yeast NPC at 8-11 Å resolution and the in situ yeast NPC
at 30-40 Å resolution (Akey et al., 2022). Comparison of “ground state” (isolated) and “active state” (in situ) NPCs
revealed that radial dilation of the NPC scaffold may accommodate changes in cargo flux or size. We now aim
to investigate the dynamics of NPC transport function of model large cargoes that can be targeted for import into
the nucleus and arrested during transport, allowing us to quantify cargo transport dynamics (function) and map
the location of the transiting cargo within the NPC (structure). We will dissect NPC transport’s energy-
dependence on nuclear Ran-GTP into separate studies of passive, Ran-insensitive cargo targeting to the NPC
(Aim 1) and active, Ran-dependent cargo transport through the NPC (Aim 2). Using well-characterized NPC
transport mutants, we will examine the behavior of actively transporting large cargoes by perturbing specific
stages along the transport path (Aim 3). This level of control will allow us to map transport functions not only to
specific Nups, but to specific regions of Nups. Quantitative fluorescence microscopy and cell fitness assays will
screen for functionally important phenotypes to selectively pursue NPC-cargo interactomics by mass
spectrometry and visualization of NPC structural changes by cryo-electron microscopy. Our functional and
structural data will inform each other in a synergistic but non-dependent fashion to reveal how the NPC adopts
distinct and discrete structural states to perform its transport functions for native (mRNPs, pre-ribosomes) and
non-native (viral capsids, nanocarriers) large cargoes. This comprehensive research strategy will advance our
understanding of (i) constitutive large cargo transport processes and malfunction of this process in disease states
(ii) interactions between viral capsids and NPCs during infection and (iii) nuclear-targeting for nanocarriers in
drug delivery and gene therapy.

 This application is designed to address the scientific goals of FOA-PA-19-112. Coronary microvascular
disease (CMD) is major sequelae of chest radiotherapy in cancer survivors. Blockade of the larger coronary
arteries can be treated by stents or surgical bypass; however, there are no effective therapies currently available
to target CMD. This project aims to investigate the novel and previously unexplored mechanisms of ionizing
radiation (IR)-induced coronary microvascular injury, and test the beneficial effects of a small molecule, N-acetyl-
ser-asp-lys-pro (Ac-SDKP), to counteract these effects. The scientific premise of this proposal is based on our
recent studies demonstrating profound endothelial cell injury with marked increase in coronary vascular
permeability, and fibrosis, after thoracic radiation exposure in rodents. We also found that radiation-induced CMD
was dose-dependently associated with the transcriptional inhibition of claudin-1 (cldn1) expression. Importantly,
administration of Ac-SDKP, a thymosin β4-derived endogenous peptide, normalized endothelial cell
permeability, reconstituted cldn1, and reduced cardiac fibrosis.
 Despite its cardioprotective potential, therapeutic application of Ac-SDKP has been challenging due to
its short half-life (T1/2 of 4.5 mins) in serum. Therefore, we have developed a stable, liposomal Ac-SDKP (Lip-
Ac-SDKP) formulation, which we intend to test for sustained systemic effects. We hypothesize that Ac-SDKP
mitigates radiation-induced coronary endothelial damage, and prevents microvascular leakage by
inhibiting IR-mediated cldn1 loss. In Aim I, we will examine the uptake efficiency and bioactivity of Lip-Ac-
SDKP in the heart and in coronary microvascular endothelial cells. In Aim II, we will examine the effects of Ac-
SDKP on endothelial barrier integrity after radiation and study the role of cldn1 in this process. In Aim III, we
will determine the effects of Ac-SDKP treatment on radiation-induced coronary blood flow and regional and
global cardiac function.
 We will accomplish these aims by using advanced molecular biology and imaging approaches. We have
developed a novel genetically engineered mouse model of endothelial cell-specific cldn1 gain-of-
function. We have also developed a cldn1 loss-of-function model using a next generation in vivo siRNA
delivery technology. Additionally, we will utilize tumor-bearing syngeneic and xenograft models to examine
Ac-SDKP effects after multi-dose thoracic irradiation. This project will provide mechanistic insight on the
protective effects of Ac-SDKP against radiation-induced CMD, and will have important therapeutic implications
for timely and targeted interventions in cancer patients susceptible to radiotherapy-induced CMD and cardiac
ischemia.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：ABSTRACT Epidemiological evidence suggests that environmental exposures during development may play a
role in disease susceptibility later in life, and researchers have hypothesized that epigenetic changes induced
by common toxicants such as pesticides, herbicides, endocrine disruptors, and heavy metals may be
facilitating this link 1,2. The mechanisms by which these changes are induced and propagated remain
challenging to dissect, largely because environmental toxicant induced changes are often 1) subtle when
assayed across the bulk cell population, 2) transient in nature and therefore difficult to reproducibly detect,
and/or 3) randomly distributed throughout the genome, making reproducibility and measurement of statistical
significance challenging. In fact, most studies trying to link toxicant exposures directly to frank cellular
transformation, including our own, have been relative failures. In virtually all cases, in order to see overt
transformation, exposure studies need to be conducted in cell or animal models that already have baseline
genetic or epigenetic changes that facilitate the progression to malignancy.
 We have exciting preliminary data that demonstrates that Ewing sarcoma cells demonstrate a
significantly elevated level of transcriptional and replication stress (RS), and we propose that environmental
exposures may not only induce RS and activate the RSR, but also cause epigenetic changes that precondition
cells to allow for survival following expression of driver fusion proteins despite elevated levels of RS. This
proposal will focus our efforts on understanding the downstream effects of TCDD exposures in mesenchymal
stem cells (MSC) when paired with 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T and investigate the role of STAG2 in modulating
downstream molecular events associated with environmental toxicant exposures. Our overall hypothesis is
that environmental toxicant exposures cooperate with STAG2 loss to increase replication stress, ultimately
leading to genomic and epigenomic instability, and creating a permissive epigenome for fusion gene
expression. Three Specific Aims are proposed:
SPECIFIC AIM 1: To determine whether environmental toxicant exposures increase baseline levels of
replication stress in iMSC and cooperate with STAG2 loss to lead to epigenomic remodeling.
SPECIFIC AIM 2: To determine whether environmental toxicant exposures cooperate with STAG2 loss to lead
increased clonal genetic and epigenetic heterogeneity.
SPECIFIC AIM 3: To determine whether environmental toxicant exposure leads to a permissive epigenome for
survival of pre-malignant cells following fusion protein expression.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：In pediatric health care non-adherence to medications is a significant driver of avoidable suffering and death.
Over half of children do not adhere to prescribed medications, and non-adherence is the leading cause of
treatment failure in pediatrics. Non-adherence can lead to worsening illness, death, preventable hospitalization,
increased health care cost, and morbidity. Even in pediatric cancer, when the consequences of non-adherence
to chemotherapy are potentially life threatening, over 40% of patients have clinically significant non-adherence.
For the most common pediatric cancer, Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL), children who miss just 10% of
chemotherapy doses have a nearly 4-fold risk of cancer relapse. Despite decades of research we do not have
effective strategies to meaningfully increase pediatric medication adherence. The goal of the proposed
research is to reduce preventable pediatric morbidity and mortality through testing a novel target – behavioral
parenting skills – as a modifiable mechanism to improve medication adherence in young children (ages 3-9).
Based upon our preliminary data we have begun to develop CareMeds, a parenting skills-focused adherence
intervention. The goal of this project is to use stages 0 and 1 of the NIH Stage Model to further develop and
evaluate the feasibility of the CareMeds intervention. Evidence is converging on family functioning and
parenting style as critical factors that shape child medication adherence. Yet, previous studies typically rely on
one-time global measures, making it difficult to discern the precise parenting skills that improve medication
adherence. For example, we know very little about what exactly “supportive” or “cohesive” families are doing to
promote medication adherence. In Aim 1 we will use direct observation of medication administration at home to
understand common episode-level barriers and identify the behavioral parenting skills that are most successful
in achieving medication administration in young children. In Aim 2 we will use daily diary data collection to
examine how daily parenting experiences influence the risk of medication non-adherence. We will use data
from Aims 1 and 2 and input from diverse parents to refine the final CareMeds intervention package. In Aim 3
we will conduct a pilot RCT of the intervention versus usual care with 100 families of young children ages 3-9
with ALL within 1 month of initiation of oral chemotherapy prescription. Findings from this program of research
will make significant conceptual contributions through providing nuanced understanding of the aspects of
parenting at the episode and daily levels that shape medication adherence in young children. It will make
innovative methodological advances through use of direct observation of medication administration, daily diary
data on transient parenting experiences, and rigorous measurement of adherence through objective behavioral
measures (electronic pill bottle monitoring) and pharmacological measures (validated biomarkers of drug
metabolites). Finally, it will have significant translational impact through setting the stage for a full-scale, multi-
center, RCT to examine the efficacy of the CareMeds intervention.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：1 Squamous cell skin cancer (SCC) is the second most common cancer in the US. There are methods available
 2 to prevent SCC but are not appropriately used because we lack methods of evaluating their effectiveness in a
 3 timely manner. Ultraviolet light (UV) from the sun induces genomic damage which is the most important cause
 4 of skin cancer. Early in the process of cancer formation UV causes mutations in cells which result in small
 5 clones, clusters of mutated cells. The early mutations that result in the growth of these clones are called
 6 clonogenic mutations (CM). CMs are early changes during SCC formation, which appear decades before
 7 clinically detectable cancer. Based on previous evidence CMs may signal skin cancer risk and evaluate the
 8 efficacy of preventative treatment strategies and sun protection. CM are in low abundance in the skin which
9 make them challenging to detect. However, recent advances in genomic sequencing technology and
10 computational tools allow accurate identification and quantitation of CMs in the skin. Preliminary data has shown
11 that CMS can be accurately detected and used to evaluate sun damaged skin areas. Many of the CMs found in
12 normal sun exposed skin are also common in SCC. The central hypothesis for this application is that CMs are
13 biomarkers of sun induced skin damaged and that CMs can measure how well strategies for skin cancer
14 prevention and preventative treatment work. In the first set of studies we will refine the previously developed
15 panel of sun induced CMs by identifying the most common CMs in sun exposed versus non-sun exposed skin.
16 Subsequent studies will examine the impact of UV exposure on changes in the CM panel and development of
17 skin cancer. These studies will evaluate patterns of CMs and the risk of developing skin cancer. Next, the
18 refined panel of CMs will be used to examine how well treatments designed to prevent skin cancer in heavily
19 sun damaged skin areas reduce CMs and skin cancer formation. In the final set of studies, CMs will be used to
20 evaluate the efficacy of sun protection strategies, such as sunscreens. Sun protection factor (SPF) is widely
21 used to evaluate sunscreens. However, SPF measures reduction in redness of the skin instead of the actual
22 DNA damage. Genomic DNA damage contributes to skin cancer, not “redness” in the skin. Genomic damage
23 can be caused by long term sun damage that does not cause a sunburn. In the final set of studies, CMs are used
24 to evaluate the effectiveness of sunscreens to protect against genomic damage and skin cancer. These studies
25 will change how we evaluate a patient’s risk of developing skin cancer and how we determine the effect of skin
26 cancer prevention. These studies have the potential to shift the focus from treating cancer to preventing the
27 occurrence of skin cancer. This would result in an improvement in cancer care outcomes, improve treatment
28 strategies and ultimately improve the life of individual with a history of sun damage and pre-cancerous lesions.
29 This work focuses on skin cancer but as CMs play a crucial first step in cancer growth in most human cancers
30 our findings and the framework of this study will have implications for the wider field of preventative oncology.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Triple negative breast cancers (TNBCs) do not express estrogen receptor-α (ERα), progesterone receptor (PR),
or human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), and therefore, none of the targeted drugs currently in use
for breast cancer are effective against them. Approximately 60-80% of TNBCs express estrogen receptor-β
(ERβ). However, pro- versus anti-tumorigenic capabilities of ERβ remains controversial. Another key molecular
characteristic of TNBC is the high frequency (80%) of p53 mutation. In addition to losing tumor suppressor
properties and exerting dominant-negative regulation over any remaining wild type p53 (WTp53), mutant p53
also acquires oncogenic gain-of-function. Increasing evidence suggests that not all mutant p53s function
similarly. Although ERβ and p53 have been implicated in TNBC pathology, whether p53 has a role in the pro-
versus anti-proliferative functional duality of ERβ remains an open question. The long-term goal is to understand
and exploit the role of ERβ-p53 crosstalk in breast cancer for the development of better therapeutic strategies.
The objective is to study how specific mutations in p53 impinges upon ERβ function in TNBC, with the prediction
that specific p53 mutation will determine its role in the ERβ-mutant p53-p73 signaling axis impacting multiple
aspects of tumor progression and metastasis. The hypothesis is that ERβ binds to and inhibits both WTp53 and
mutant p53, leading to opposite effects on progression and therapeutic response of TNBC to agents such as
Tamoxifen (Tam). The rationale for the proposed research is that understanding how ERβ elicits opposite
functions in a p53 status-dependent manner will be critical to stratify TNBC patients to repurpose established
therapeutic agents such as Tam to treat large percentage of TNBC patients. The specific aims are: (1 Determine
the interaction of different p53 mutants with p73 and ERβ in TNBC cells; (2) Analyze the differential effects of
p53 mutants on tumor progression, metastasis and therapeutic response in vivo; and (3) Evaluate the clinical
significance of the ERβ-p53-p73 signaling axis. In specific aim 1, Isogenic TNBC cells expressing different
combinations of ERβ and WT and p53 mutants generated using CRISPR technology and shRNA-mediated
conditional knockdown will be used for analyzing the mechanisms underlying the interaction and its impact on
cellular functions in vitro and tumor progression in vivo. In specific aim 2, the effect of different p53 mutations on
tumor growth and metastasis will be analyzed in vivo. The clinical relevance of these studies will be evaluated
using well-characterized patient derived xenografts (PDXs); patient tumor-derived organoids (PDOs); and patient
tumor tissues with linked clinical database (specific aim 3). The contribution of this research is expected to be
better understanding of the mechanisms by which ERβ-p53-p73 axis in the context of different p53 mutations
affects the disease progression and therapeutic response. The proposal is innovative because analyzing the
differential effects of different p53 mutations as part of an integrated ERβ-mutant p53-p73 signaling axis is a
departure from the status quo and has the potential of developing novel therapeutic strategies against TNBC.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Durable outcomes in subsets of solid cancer patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) or adoptive
cell transfer (ACT) immunotherapy has driven interest in gaining a better understanding of resistance
mechanisms that could identify novel druggable targets. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) have
emerged as one such barrier based on their ability to inhibit innate and adaptive immunity. While elevated blood
MDSC are recognized as a poor prognostic indicator in cancer patients, it is widely thought that the main effector
site for MDSC is within the tumor microenvironment (TME). This is in line with the well-documented contact-
dependent mechanisms involving short-lived intermediates that underlie known mechanisms of T cell
suppression by MDSC. Our published and preliminary studies enlarge on this view, showing that MDSC also
function outside the TME through an unprecedented mechanism of intravascular immune suppression. The
proposed study builds on our discovery that circulating MDSC initiate contact-dependent cleavage of the L-
selectin homing receptor on target T cells that substantially reduces antigen-driven expansion of cytotoxic T cells
in lymph nodes. We further found that L-selectin loss coincides with the formation of stable MDSC clusters in the
blood of murine tumor models and advanced cancer patients. We term these new structures circulating myeloid
cell (CMC) clusters. These observations led us to hypothesize that CMC clusters are an unrecognized functional
niche for systemic immune suppression in cancer. To test this hypothesis, we will first determine if blood-borne
MDSC target not only naïve T cells, but more broadly attack stem cell memory and central memory T cells and
natural killer cells that each require L-selectin for their antitumor activity. Secondly, we will determine if CMC
clusters are the active site of L-selectin cleavage by using a multipronged genetic approach to examine L-selectin
fate following disruption of MDSC-T cell conjugate formation in vivo. These mechanistic studies center on β2
integrins that are highly expressed by MDSC but are normally inactive on leukocytes in fast-flowing blood under
non-pathological conditions. Thirdly, we will examine the translational relevance of CMC clusters during ICI or
ACT therapy in a preclinical model in which blood is the primary effector site for MDSC due to their exclusion
from the TME (by blocking chemokine-directed trafficking) and spleen (by splenectomy). We will deplete
circulating MDSC in this model using antibodies or a clinically relevant liver-X-receptor agonist that induces
MDSC-intrinsic apoptosis to establish if blood-borne MDSC contribute to therapeutic resistance. Complementary
studies will test the hypothesis that combining the analysis of circulating MDSC with CMC clusters and/or T cell
L-selectin will formulate an immunosuppressive signature that predicts response to first-line therapy in metastatic
cancer patients. The proposed studies will provide new insights into an unprecedented function of circulating
myeloid cells and could lead to the consideration of CMC clusters as a functional biomarker for prognostication
or preselection of patients that would benefit from MDSC-depleting regimens during cancer immunotherapy.

determinants of the response to endocrine therapy as well as targeted therapies that are frequently employed
in the treatment of ER+ metastatic breast cancer. Here we will focus on the RB-tumor suppressor pathway as
a central node controlling proliferation downstream of multiple pathways of relevance to therapy of ER+ breast
cancer (e.g. endocrine therapy and CDK4/6 inhibitors). While RB is required for the effective cytostatic
response to a range of targeted therapies employed in ER+ breast cancer, multiple pathways can contribute to
“cell cycle plasticity” and therefore represent distinct means for generating therapeutic resistance. Here we will
delineate the processes underlying this form of resistance, means to elicit durable cell cycle arrest, and
approaches to target resistance as observed clinically (Aim 1). Our data and newly published studies indicate
that RB loss occurs in ER+ breast cancer as a means to escape from cytostatic therapies. Analysis of the RB
locus in ER+ breast cancer indicates loss of one copy of 13q occurs in a significant fraction of ER+ breast
cancers, suggesting that such tumors are primed for RB loss. How to subsequently treat tumors that are
heterogeneous for RB or are solely RB deficient represents a significant challenge. Using drug screening and
organoid approaches we have defined several regimens that are particularly effective against RB-negative
tumors and could represent a general means to target ER+ tumors that progress on CDK4/6 inhibitors (Aim 2).
Together these aims will interrogate means to further leverage the RB tumor suppressor for a precision
approach to the treatment of ER+ breast cancer.

Head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) are aggressive neoplasms that result in debilitating
changes in speech, appearance, and quality of life in humans. Response rates in HNSCC patients have
remained relatively unchanged over the years, especially in patients with human papillomavirus (HPV)
negative HNSCC highlighting the critical need for novel strategies to meet the therapeutic needs of this patient
population. As recognized by PAR-17-245, a critical step in discovering novel therapies for HNSCC patients is
the development of tumor models that can reliably recapitulate human disease biology, heterogeneity and
therapeutic response. The overall goal of this application is to validate and credential a panel of patient-
derived and immunocompetent models of HNSCC. Systematic and in-depth comparison of histopathologic,
genomic, and therapeutic response profiles will be performed across multiple preclinical platforms in vitro
(organoids) and in vivo (allografts/xenografts). Paired in vitro and in vivo models across these platforms will be
used to assess their response to standard of care chemoradiation and immune checkpoint blockade. The
models will also be used to screen the activity of novel and FDA-approved agents (‘drug repurposing’)
targeting critical pathways implicated in the pathogenesis of HNSCC. The application builds on an existing
collaboration between several investigators at Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center with extensive
experience and expertise in mammalian models, head and neck cancer, cancer imaging, tumor immunology,
genomics, bioinformatics and cancer therapeutics. The project will employ innovative multimodal functional
imaging methods to better define and enhance the true translational utility of mammalian models. The proposal
will establish a robust panel of credentialed mammalian models of HNSCC and enable development of an
integrated preclinical pipeline to assess efficacy of novel therapeutics, identify resistance mechanisms and
enable biomarker discovery in HNSCC.

This proposal describes a 5-year research career development program focused on a non-canonical role of RB1
loss in bladder cancer. Dr. Qiang Li is an Assistant Professor of Oncology at Roswell Park Comprehensive
Cancer Center in the Department of Urology. The proposal builds on the candidate’s previous experience and
current research projects using genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) and organoids. The proposed
experiments and training will enable his transition to independence as a physician scientist in bladder cancer
translational research. He will be mentored primarily by Dr. David Goodrich. Dr. Goodrich is an expert in RB1
cancer biology, genetically engineered mouse models, acquired drug resistance and cancer cell plasticity. The
training plan includes the following goals: (1) Enhance expertise in preclinical cancer modeling (GEMM and
organoids); (2) Probe the molecular mechanisms of bladder cancer cellular plasticity and drug resistance; and
(3) Gain expertise in bioinformatic analysis.
RB1 mutations are predictive of pathologic response after neoadjuvant chemotherapy in bladder cancer. Other
clinical observations suggest that the basal type of bladder cancer is more likely to respond to chemotherapy
than the luminal type. However, the biological impact of RB1 loss on molecular subtypes of bladder cancer
pathogenesis and chemotherapy response has not been investigated. Newly discovered features of the RB1
pathway in other cancer types suggest that RB1 loss promotes lineage plasticity and acquired therapy
resistance. Thus, we hypothesize that RB1 loss promotes bladder cancer progression, metastasis, and cellular
plasticity (luminal to basal, and therapeutic resistance). We use two transgenic mouse systems (Uroplakin II
driven reverse tetracycline trans-activator, TRE-Cre) to investigate the role of RB1 loss in bladder urothelium by
facilitating deletion of tumor suppressor genes (Trp53, Pten, Rb1) under control of doxycycline administration.
We engineered doxycycline inducible triple knockout mice Trp53-/-: Pten-/-: Rb1-/- (referred as TKO) and double
knockout mice Trp53-/-: Pten-/- (referred as DKO). We propose the following Specific Aims: (1) Define the function
of RB1 loss in accelerating tumor progression, metastasis, and cellular plasticity in bladder cancer GEMMs; (2)
Dissect the impact of cell-of-origin on bladder tumorigenesis, metastasis and response to chemotherapy in TKO
tumors derived from basal cells versus luminal cells. Successful completion of this proposal will allow the
candidate to gain valuable technical knowledge and expertise in preclinical modeling of advanced bladder cancer
and further his development as an independent physician scientist. The work will also establish experimental
models and analysis pipelines that will provide the foundation for the candidate’s independent research program.

While several innovative and creative immuno-oncology (IO) strategies have shown promising results, a
significant expansion of their clinical use will require collaborative efforts to elucidate the resistance mechanism,
discover new immune targets, identify predictive biomarkers, evaluate combination therapies, and develop
preventive approaches. Utilizing a multi-disciplinary team approach, we will support Immuno-Oncology
Translation Network (IOTN)-funded components to discover new immune targets and evaluate novel immune-
based therapies and combination approaches that eliminate established cancers in adults or to prevent
cancers before they occur. Our DMRC strategy is to serve as an administrative and analytic hub at every step
of the IOTN’s translational studies, focusing to reduce the barrier for access to analytic expertise, improve the
productivity of IOTN investigators, maintain a high standard for data collection and management, design and
perform rigorous analytical strategies, and foster a collaborative and supportive research community.
An experienced, multidisciplinary team has been assembled to pursue four specific aims: First, we will provide
a centralized administration infrastructure to coordinate IOTN activities, building upon the NRG Oncology
Statistical and Data Coordinating Center’s experience of coordinating over 450 translational cancer studies
across hundreds of participating sites. Second, we will provide multidisciplinary analytic expertise to support
IOTN collaborative research, leveraging five of RPCI CCSG’s shared resources: Biostatistics, Bioinformatics,
Biomedical Data Science, Data Bank and BioRepository, and Immune Analysis. Our analytic support will be
armed with professional IT staff and informed by an experienced IO researcher team. Third, we will develop
innovative data integration methods to enhance IOTN research capacity, capitalizing on the well-respected
Bioconductor project and the independent research programs of the RPCI department of Biostatistics and
Bioinformatics. Fourth, we will actively promote the IOTN and engage in trans-consortium interactions, where
we will leverage Bioconductor’s decade-long experience in community engagement and the NRG data center’s
rich expertise in project coordination. Leveraging our active NCI-funded RPCI-committed resource to support
the proposed multi-institutional trans-disciplinary IO research is not only cost-effective, but also flexible in its
study-dependent scalability. Taken together, we envision that our DMRC, in close collaboration with the IOTN,
will allow us to conduct highly effective and innovative translational studies to address the significantly unmet
clinical needs related to IO.

Over half of children do not adhere to prescribed medications, and non-adherence is the leading cause of
treatment failure in pediatrics. Non-adherence can lead to worsening illness, death, preventable hospitalization,
increased health care cost, and morbidity. Even in pediatric cancer, when the consequences of non-adherence
to chemotherapy are potentially life threatening, over 40% of patients have clinically significant non-adherence.
For the most common pediatric cancer, Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL), children who miss just 10% of
chemotherapy doses have a nearly 4-fold risk of cancer relapse. Despite decades of research we do not have
effective strategies to meaningfully increase pediatric medication adherence. The goal of the proposed
research is to reduce preventable pediatric morbidity and mortality through testing a novel target – behavioral
parenting skills – as a modifiable mechanism to improve medication adherence in young children (ages 3-9).
Based upon our preliminary data we have begun to develop CareMeds, a parenting skills-focused adherence
intervention. The goal of this project is to use stages 0 and 1 of the NIH Stage Model to further develop and
evaluate the feasibility of the CareMeds intervention. Evidence is converging on family functioning and
parenting style as critical factors that shape child medication adherence. Yet, previous studies typically rely on
one-time global measures, making it difficult to discern the precise parenting skills that improve medication
adherence. For example, we know very little about what exactly “supportive” or “cohesive” families are doing to
promote medication adherence. In Aim 1 we will use direct observation of medication administration at home to
understand common episode-level barriers and identify the behavioral parenting skills that are most successful
in achieving medication administration in young children. In Aim 2 we will use daily diary data collection to
examine how daily parenting experiences influence the risk of medication non-adherence. We will use data
from Aims 1 and 2 and input from diverse parents to refine the final CareMeds intervention package. In Aim 3
we will conduct a pilot RCT of the intervention versus usual care with 100 families of young children ages 3-9
with ALL within 1 month of initiation of oral chemotherapy prescription. Findings from this program of research
will make significant conceptual contributions through providing nuanced understanding of the aspects of
parenting at the episode and daily levels that shape medication adherence in young children. It will make
innovative methodological advances through use of direct observation of medication administration, daily diary
data on transient parenting experiences, and rigorous measurement of adherence through objective behavioral
measures (electronic pill bottle monitoring) and pharmacological measures (validated biomarkers of drug
metabolites). Finally, it will have significant translational impact through setting the stage for a full-scale, multi-
center, RCT to examine the efficacy of the CareMeds intervention.

determinants of the response to endocrine therapy as well as targeted therapies that are frequently employed
in the treatment of ER+ metastatic breast cancer. Here we will focus on the RB-tumor suppressor pathway as
a central node controlling proliferation downstream of multiple pathways of relevance to therapy of ER+ breast
cancer (e.g. endocrine therapy and CDK4/6 inhibitors). While RB is required for the effective cytostatic
response to a range of targeted therapies employed in ER+ breast cancer, multiple pathways can contribute to
“cell cycle plasticity” and therefore represent distinct means for generating therapeutic resistance. Here we will
delineate the processes underlying this form of resistance, means to elicit durable cell cycle arrest, and
approaches to target resistance as observed clinically (Aim 1). Our data and newly published studies indicate
that RB loss occurs in ER+ breast cancer as a means to escape from cytostatic therapies. Analysis of the RB
locus in ER+ breast cancer indicates loss of one copy of 13q occurs in a significant fraction of ER+ breast
cancers, suggesting that such tumors are primed for RB loss. How to subsequently treat tumors that are
heterogeneous for RB or are solely RB deficient represents a significant challenge. Using drug screening and
organoid approaches we have defined several regimens that are particularly effective against RB-negative
tumors and could represent a general means to target ER+ tumors that progress on CDK4/6 inhibitors (Aim 2).
Together these aims will interrogate means to further leverage the RB tumor suppressor for a precision
approach to the treatment of ER+ breast cancer.

metabolic enzymes. It is quite evident from current literature that many of the mitochondrial enzymes are
localized to the nucleus, more so in diseased conditions such as cancer. However, there is a significant gap in
knowledge about their spatial distribution in the nucleus and biological function. We believe nuclear localization
of mitochondrial metabolic enzymes is not random, and there is specific necessity coupled to critical biological
functions that regulate this process. In this study we wish to perform a comprehensive functional
characterization deciphering the spatial and temporal role of mitochondrial enzymes in the nucleus. Our
preliminary findings identified Kreb’s cycle enzymes such as aconitase (ACO2), α-keto glutarate (AKG), and
citrate synthase (CS); and glycolytic enzymes such as pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) and ATP-citrate lyase
are enriched in the nucleus of cancer cells. We hypothesize these mitochondrial enzymes form complex in the
nucleus based which is yet to be characterized. We hypothesize that they function as a large-multi enzyme
complex which is recruited to chromatin by transcription factors and coregulators to sustain metabolic stress
encountered during gene transcription. Using metabolomics, proteomics, chromatin immunoprecipitation and
gene expression analysis, we envision detailing the sequential events driving their recruitment by nuclear
factors on chromatin, and their role in reprogramming transcription machinery to drive aggressive cancer. This
is a novel concept supported by isolated reports from various groups, yet remains relatively unexplored and a
comprehensive mechanistic study is lacking. We envision findings from our study will have a major impact on
broad important problems in biomedical research including metabolic disorders and cancer.

Given the high mortality of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) as a result of relapse after androgen
deprivation therapy (ADT), novel treatment strategies are urgently needed. Tumor suppressor gene-
phosphatase and tensin homolog (
PTEN) is mutated in approximately 20% of primary prostate cancers, and in
as many as 40~60% of CRPC. In addition to activation of PI3K oncogenic signaling pathway, loss of PTEN is
also associated with cytokine and chemokine signaling that creates an immunosuppressive microenvironment.
Both defects in antigen presentation in tumor cells and the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME)
have been implicated in CRPC progression after ADT and therapeutic resistance in prostate cancer in the clinic.
Genetic or pharmacologic inactivation of β isoform of PI3K (p110β) in PTEN-deficient prostate cancer has been
reported to significantly inhibit tumor growth and progression. Ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related (ATR)
exhibits essential functions in controlling DNA replication stress and DNA damage response in cancer cells.
PTEN-deficient cells have been reported to be more sensitive to ATR inhibition. PI3Kβ is also functionally
associated with DNA damage response and genomic integrity in tumor growth. By using a syngeneic genetically
engineered mouse model of CRPC driven by co-deletion of PTEN and TP53 (PP-CRPC), we found that addition
of p110β inhibitor significantly reduces the viability of ATR inhibitor-treated PP-CRPC cells. Moreover, our
preliminary data show that inhibition of p110β or ATR alone significantly increases MHC class I antigen
presentation in mouse or human CRPC cells. Based on these novel preliminary data, we hypothesize that p110β
inhibitor in combination with ATR inhibitor will show promising anti-tumor activity in PTEN-deficient CRPC via
inducing cell death in cancer cells and anti-tumor immunity in the tumor microenvironment. We also hypothesize
that inhibition of p110β will increase DNA replication stress and sensitize PTEN-deficient CRPC cells to ATR
inhibition. In this study, we will
1)
evaluate the therapeutic efficacy and antitumor immune responses of combined
ATR inhibition and p110β
inhibition i
n syngeneic PTEN-deficient CRPC mouse models; 2) investigate the
molecular mechanisms of the combined effect of ATR inhibitor and p110β
inhibitor in replication stress and DNA
damage-induced cell death in PTEN-deficient CRPC cells.
Our study will not only provide fundamental
information for translational research of p110β inhibitors and ATR inhibitors in cancer treatment, but also provide
a novel treatment strategy for patients with PTEN-deficient advanced CRPC.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：A developing body of preclinical evidence suggests that the integrity and composition of the tumor immune
microenvironment (TIME) is highly plastic and is modulated by host lifestyle exposures. Unhealthful exposures
including obesity, inactivity and a high fat diet can lead to a loss of CD8+ T cell effector function and tumor
progression in preclinical breast tumor models, while healthful exposures, such as voluntary wheel running, can
offset tumor growth and dysregulated conditions in the TIME leading to increased trafficking and enhanced func-
tion of CD8+ T cells. Although emerging pre-clinical evidence is compelling, several gaps in epidemiological
knowledge regarding the link among lifestyle factors, tumor immunity and BC outcomes remain.
 First, despite a suggestion to adhere to The American Institute for Cancer Research (AICR) and The Ameri-
can Cancer Society (ACS) cancer prevention lifestyle guidelines after a cancer diagnosis, which lifestyle factors
and whether they work together to impact BC outcomes has not been well established. Second, research on the
role of lifestyles and immunity in BC patients has primarily focused on immune cell subsets in the circulating
peripheral blood. To our knowledge, whether lifestyles are associated with distinct immune cell phenotypes in
the breast TIME, the site most relevant for treatment response and BC prognosis, has remained uninvestigated.
 Building off the extant preclinical evidence and multiple lines of published and preliminary evidence from our
group, we designed the current study to address these critical gaps in knowledge. Leveraging data from 1160
primary invasive BC patients enrolled in the Data Bank and BioRepository (DBBR) at Roswell Park, we devel-
oped a composite lifestyle index score (LIS) reflecting adherence to seven cancer prevention recommendations
from The AICR and The ACS including: 1) maintaining a healthy weight; 2) being physically active; 3) eating a
variety of fruits and vegetables; 4) limiting red and processed meats; 5) limiting or avoiding sugar-sweetened
beverages; 6) limiting or avoiding alcohol consumption; and 7) avoiding smoking. Our preliminary analyses re-
veals that patients with the highest versus lowest LIS (e.g., tertiles) experience striking survival advantages.
Based on these and other preliminary data, we formulated our central hypothesis that CD8+ T cell composition
in the breast TIME mediates the observed association between the LIS and BC outcomes. To test this hypothesis,
we will link detailed lifestyle data with multispectral immunohistochemical immune profiling from 1160 BC patients
enrolled in DBBR with available FFPE tumor tissue to execute formal mediation pathway analyses via three
Specific Aims. In aim 1, we will define associations of the LIS with CD8+ T cell composition in the breast TIME
(cell densities, ratios and clusters of total CD8+ T cells, exhausted CD8+ T cells and activated CD8+ T cells).
Next, in aim 2, we will identify associations of CD8+ T cell composition in the breast TIME with BC outcomes. In
aim 3, we will delineate the contributions of CD8+ T cells in the TIME as biological intermediaries underlying the
observed association between the LIS and BC outcomes.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：ABSTRACT
Breast cancer (BC) is a complex and heterogeneous neoplastic disease with a high incidence and mortality. BC
can be divided into clinical, histopathologic, and molecular subtypes. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC)
accounts for approximately 15% of all breast cancer cases and is characterized by tumors that do not express
the estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2).
TNBC is thought to be the most aggressive subtype and is associated with a poor prognosis, as well as a high
risk of distant recurrence and death within the first 3–5 years of follow-up. The absence of these receptors
renders TNBC resistant to treatments targeting those pathways. Thus, TNBC still remains a neoplastic disease
with unmet clinical challenges. Our laboratory has previously demonstrated an integral tumor-intrinsic role of
TAZ (transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif; also known as WWTR1), which is a key component of
the Hippo signaling pathway found in TNBC progression/metastasis. New preliminary data in our laboratory
indicate that tumor TAZ expression inhibits tumor progression in mouse models of TNBC cells in immune system
intact mice, thus indicating that TAZ expression also plays an underappreciated extrinsic role in TNBC biology.
We further revealed that TAZ regulates the recruitment and/or function of immune suppressive cells, such as
myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), macrophages and regulatory T cells (Tregs). The overall objective
of this proposal is to understand the underlying molecular mechanisms by which TAZ expression in tumor cells
regulates immune suppressive cells in TNBC. Our central hypothesis is that tumor TAZ expression regulates the
TME landscape via cross-talk between cancer cells with non-cancer immune suppressive cells. Our long-term
goal is to decipher TAZ regulated crosstalk between breast tumor cells and the immune components within the
tumor microenvironment (TME) to uncover new prognostic or therapeutic targets for TNBC. To achieve these
goals, we propose the following two aims: 1) To determine the impact of tumor-intrinsic TAZ expression on the
immune-TME; and 2) To understand the molecular mechanisms of TAZ expression driven immune suppressive
cells recruitment in TME. A major impact of this study is to identify previously undescribed TAZ-mediated
mechanisms that will unveil new biomarkers or inform novel therapeutic interventions for advanced TNBC.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Summary
Patients with extrabronchial tumors that induce malignant central airway obstruction (MCAO) face significant
morbidity and only 1-7 months median overall survival. An estimated 20-30% of patients with lung cancer will
have MCAO during the course of their disease, but other malignancies that metastasize to the airway can induce
central airway obstruction. We have recently reported, in a Phase I study, that Photofrin® mediated image-
guided interstitial photodynamic therapy (I-PDT) with our novel treatment planning and light dosimetry platform
is safe, with promising outcomes. Three out of 10 treated patients are alive at 26.5, 12 and 8.3 months. Our
image-based treatment planning was used to guide the administration of the light dose rate (irradiance) and light
dose (fluence) to the target tumor while sparing adjacent normal tissue.
Our goal is to improve the rate of complete and partial tumor response of extrabronchial MCAO to I-PDT. To that
end we propose to increase tumor blood oxygenation that will increase laser light transmission and oxygen
supply known to improve the efficacy of PDT. Murine studies reported that palliative x-ray radiotherapy (p-XRT)
can increase tumor oxygenation and alter vasculature. We therefore explore the use of p-XRT to improve tumor
response to I-PDT. Our preliminary data demonstrate that p-XRT followed by I-PDT (p-XRT/I-PDT) significantly
increases (p<0.05) complete response of locally advanced mouse tumors, in comparison to either I-PDT or p-
XRT. Under compassionate care exemption we showed that I-PDT delivered 48 ± 4h after 8Gy x1 p-XRT can
provide control of extrabronchial MCAO in two patients. There are no effective treatments for extrabronchial
MCAO. Thus, the overriding significance of our proposal is its responsiveness to an unmet clinical need.
We hypothesize that standard of care p-XRT (8Gy x1) followed by I-PDT is safe and will improve treatment
outcomes in patients with extrabronchial MCAO, and that this improvement is due to changes in the
tumor microenvironment. To test our hypothesis, we propose to accomplish the following aims.
Aim 1. To conduct a Phase I/II study to test the safety and efficacy of p-XRT followed by I-PDT in patients
with extrabronchial MCAO. We define success as demonstrating that this treatment is safe and result in ≥50%
of participants having partial or complete tumor response and/or significant improvement in quality of life and
physical performance at 3 months post treatment. We will

evaluate the relationship of changes in light
Aim 2. To define the mechanisms by which p-XRT improves tumor response to I-PDT in mouse models.
We will define how changes in tumor microenvironment impact light transmission and tumor response, as well
as the contribution of anti-tumor immunity to tumor control and tumor-free survival.
These data will inform the design of a future randomized Phase II trial of p-XRT/I-PDT versus standard of care.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Abstract. DNA-targeting drugs are a mainstream therapy for cancer, but it is becoming clearer that some of their
anti-cancer activity is due not only to DNA damage, but also chromatin decondensation, which we call chromatin
damage (CD). Moreover, it has been shown that some drugs cause only CD without DNA damage, and these
"CD-only" drugs are as potent anti-cancer drugs as compounds causing both CD and DNA damage, but lack the
toxicity associated with DNA damage. The focus of our study is to understand how CD activates IFN, and how
this property can be used in the clinic to gauge the potency of CD drugs. Our ultimate goal of our research is to
show that CD is a superior mechanism to DNA damage for the next generation of anti-cancer chemotherapy,
which is more effective, less toxic, and more powerful in activating an anti-tumor immune response.
 To achieve this goal, we have developed a new group of "CD-only" chemicals, curaxins. The anti-cancer
activity of curaxin clinical lead, CBL0137, has been demonstrated in multiple mouse models. Phase I trial has
shown manageable toxicities and evidence of antitumor activity. These studies confirmed induction of IFN
signaling by CBL0137 in mice and humans. Notably, curaxins cause stronger and faster IFN induction than DNA
damaging agents, DNA methyltransferase inhibitors, and HDAC inhibitors. It is well established now that IFN
induction significantly improves their anti-cancer efficacy of DNA damaging therapy. CD causes IFN induction
via different mechanisms, but our data showed that IFN activation enhances anti-cancer efficacy of CD.
 Therefore, we propose that anti-cancer activity of CD agents is mediated in vivo via two complementary
mechanisms: direct killing of tumor cells and engagement of anti-tumor immune attack. This proposal focuses
on the hypothesis that IFN signaling in tumor and/or non-tumor cells is induced by CD via a mechanism different
from DNA damage and potentiates the anti-cancer activity of CD drugs.
 We will focus on triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), a challenging disease to treat due to its aggressive
behavior and lack of actionable targets. Our specific aims are: 1. Determine the impact of the IFN activation
in tumor and non-tumor cells on the anti-tumor activity of CD therapy. 2. Define the mechanisms of IFN
activation by CD agents. 3. Develop strategies for reversing the immune suppressive environment in
triple-negative breast cancer using CD agents.

Novel deep learning frameworks for predicting nucleosome-binding proteins
Nucleosome-binding proteins (NBPs) such as pioneer transcription factors play an important role in cell fate
changes during organogenesis, cell differentiation, and reprogramming. The ability of nucleosome binding is
encoded within their DNA-binding domains. However, experimental identification of the NBPs is expensive and
time-consuming with low sensitivity. The proposed research aims to develop novel deep learning frameworks to
predict the NBPs. In Aim 1, we will develop a novel two-stage transfer learning framework. In the first stage, the
knowledge of the protein language model ProtT5 will be extracted as feature embeddings to represent the amino
acid sequences of the proteins. The information from the 1-D sequences will be combined with that from their 3-
D structures, which will be processed by a state-of-the-art Graph Neural Network (GNN) for 3-D molecules. In
the second stage, the GNN model will be first initialized by annotated DNA-binding proteins (DBPs) and then
fine-tuned on a NBP dataset. In Aim 2, we will design and implement a novel transfer learning-continual learning
framework to predict the NBPs in a species-specific manner. The transfer learning module initializes a novel
Bayesian online inference model with the knowledge acquired from the DBP prediction model of Aim 1 through
a prior for generative probabilistic neural networks. The continual learning module based on probabilistic
inferences will be able to constantly update learned neural network parameters with the DBPs of a given species
without forgetting the previously acquired knowledge. Lastly, the trained DBP prediction model will be fine-tuned
to make predictions of species-specific NBPs. Overall, this proof-of-concept study aims to gain technical
knowledge on the proposed frameworks and evaluate their feasibility for predicting the nucleosome binders.
These frameworks, if successful, will have a potential to broadly advance biomedical research by being
generalized to other types of intermolecular interactions, e.g., protein-RNA interactions and protein-protein
interactions.

will include important serotypes, their impact and cost-effectiveness will likely be less than what was
achieved with introduction of PCV7, PCV10 and PCV13 because, in recent years, prevalent serotypes
causing infections have changed and continue to change. Here we propose a clinical study,
vaccinating children with a low cost-to-produce, serotype-independent, killed, non-capsulated avirulent
whole-cell Streptococcus pneumoniae (wSp) vaccine that elicits Th17 cell-mediated immunity and
antibodies against all pneumococcal serotyypes, and which has been tested in adults and toddlers.
Nasopharyngeal (NP) colonization is a prerequisite to pneumococcal diseases and transmission. We
will evaluate the efficacy of wSp vaccination in young children on pneumococcal NP colonization at
times of health and onset of acute otitis media. Notably, prevention of pneumococcal NP colonization
may be a surrogate for prevention by wSp of pneumococcal infections. In addition, we will confirm the
safety and immunogenicity of wSp. Demonstration of a reduction of NP colonization, safety,
immunogenicity of wSp would engage the scientific and public health community and
commercialization support for additional licensure studies to next test for protection against various
pneumococcal diseases, to determine whether wSp could complement PCVs or even replace PCVs
as an inexpensive, serotype-independent vaccine.

This project proposes to revolutionize image-guided surgery (IGS) technology by tracking surgical modiﬁcations
in real time. IGS has profoundly changed modern endoscopic surgical techniques by allowing surgeons to
visualize pathologies that are not visible by endoscopy, to direct surgical instruments through the patient's
anatomy. However, revcurrent IGS is a static mechanism and can neither dynamically track surgery nor update
IGS reference images by CT or MRI in real time. The reference images easily deviate from the actual anatomy
and pathology during surgery, and surgeons must rely on memory to ensure the correctness and completeness of
the resection. This is more pronounced when the surgery covers a big area or involves soft tissue. In endoscopic
sinus and skull base surgery (ESSBS), for example, the surgery involves the wide sinus and skull base area,
which is a honeycomb-shaped structure surrounded by dense blood vessels and nerves. revDriven by ensuring the
safety of the patient during the operation, there is a reluctance to avoid more eﬀective but riskier resections.
This results in a currently accepted revision rate of ESSBS of up to 28%. By real-time tracking and guiding,
the precision of surgery would be dramatically increased, leading to far greater success in surgery, with a vastly
reduced percentage of required revision surgery.
This design approach will focus on the ability to track modiﬁcation and update images in real-time through
system optimization and advanced algorithms. revThe project will use a novel deep causal learning (DCL)
framework to break the bottleneck that results from the current unpredictable adverse factors in operating
rooms. The framework will use invertible nets to learn from data and clinical knowledge and identify, isolate,
and compensate for the adverse factors, leading to a realistic solution to this problem. A research team has been
assembled including surgeons, and computer scientists, to identify the limitations and challenges to formulate
a research plan to redesign the utility of IGS information to track surgery in real-time. The team will rely on
years of previous collaboration together to verify the feasibility of motion-based modiﬁcation tracking. More
speciﬁcally, this project will use motion and endoscopic videos (Aims 1 and 2) to independently track surgical
modiﬁcations. The two methods are based on the DCL framework, and the tracking results not only have
accuracy and estimated conﬁdence but will include the impacts of adverse factors as well. Moreover, the project
will fuse the two methods and verify clinical usability in the operating room environment (Aim 3).
revThis project will achieve reliable real-time updates of IGS in real clinical environments, and directly improve
the reliability of ESSBS surgical navigation. The project will pioneer tracking of surgical modiﬁcation when both
deformation and modiﬁcation are present, and extend the application of IGS to a broader array of endoscopic
surgeries. The use of causal learning to solve the medical modeling problem will be explored, thus paving the
way for using current and prior medical knowledge to formulate critical new learning of IGS procedures.

ABSTRACT
Over the past several years, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), especially deep learning (DL),
has been the most prominent direction of tomographic research, commercial development, clinical translation,
and FDA evaluation. Recently, it has become widely recognized that deep neural networks often have
generalizability issues and are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, deliberate or unintentional. This critical
challenge must be addressed to optimize the performance of deep neural networks in medical applications.
In January this year, FDA published an action plan for furthering the oversight for AI/DL-based software as
medical devices (SaMDs). One major action underlined in the plan is “regulatory science methods related to
algorithm bias and robustness”. The significance of ensuring the safety and effectiveness of AI/DL-based
SaMDs cannot be overestimated since AI is expected to play a critical role in the future of medicine. In this
context, the overall goal of this academic-FDA partnership R01 project is to generate diverse training and
challenging testing datasets of low-dose CT (LDCT) scans, prototype a virtual CT workflow, and establish an
evaluation methodology for AI-based imaging products to support FDA marketing authorization. The technical
innovation lies in cutting-edge DL methods empowered by (a) adversarial learning to generate anatomically
and pathologically representative features in the human chest; (b) adversarial attacking to probe the virtual CT
workflow in individual steps and its entirety; and (c) systematic evaluation methods to better characterize and
predict the clinical performance of AI-based imaging products. In contrast to other CT simulation pipelines, our
Adversarially Based CT (ABC) platform relies on adversarial learning to ensure diversity and realism of the
simulated data and images and improve the generalizability of deep networks, and utilizes adversarial samples
to probe the ABC workflow to address the robustness of deep networks.
The overarching hypothesis is that adversarial learning and attacking methods are powerful to deliver high-
quality datasets for AI-based imaging research and performance evaluation. The specific aims are: (1) diverse
patient modeling (SBU), (2) virtual CT scanning (UTSW), (3) deep CT imaging (RPI), (4) virtual workflow
validation (FDA), and (5) ABC system dissemination (RPI-SBU-UTSW-FDA). In this project, generative
adversarial learning will play an instrumental role in generating features of clinical semantics. Also, adversarial
samples will be produced in both sinogram and image domains. In these complementary ways, AI-based
imaging products can be efficiently evaluated for not only accuracy but also generalizability and robustness.
Upon completion, our ABC workflow/platform will be made publicly available and readily extendable to other
imaging modalities and other diseases. This ABC system will be shared through the FDA’s Catalog of
Regulatory Science Tools, and uniquely well positioned to greatly facilitate the development, assessment and
translation of emerging AI-based imaging products.

 Bone fractures, due to aging and disease, contribute significantly to healthcare cost
affecting the quality of life of 32.6 million adults in the US. Clinically, fracture risk can be
predicted by dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) or the fracture risk assessment (FRAX) tool.
Because type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients exhibit high bone mineral density, both of these tools
fail to correctly predict fracture risk, leading to a significant increase of fragility fractures in
diabetic subjects. Therefore, there is a need to investigate how modifications in collagen and
other organic components in bone can forecast diabetic fractures. Pentosidine (PEN), a
fluorescent Advanced Glycation Endproduct (AGE) that forms in bone by reaction between
sugars and proteins, is the only established marker of bone fragility. However, it does not
consistently predict T2D and fragility fractures. Here, for the first time in bone, we demonstrate
the formation of carboxymethyl-lysine (CML), a non-fluorescent AGE associated with
glycoxidative damage and hyperglycemia. We further show that it forms in abundance in bone
and is highly correlated to loss of bone toughness. Preliminary data presented in the proposal
demonstrate that, in contrast to other AGEs, CML is upregulated >60% in T2D human bone
compared to their age-matched controls. We then provide evidence that CML promotes
formation and growth of additional hydroxyapatite (HA) crystals, similar to human T2D condition,
and forms a ‘molecular link’ between the organic and inorganic components of bone (collagen-
HA interface) impairing bone quality. CML could therefore be a ‘new and relevant’ biomarker
of T2D fracture that captures the effects of hyperglycemia and oxidative stress in bone
and explains why diabetic bone is susceptible to fracture during overt T2D. Using an
obese and a non-obese mouse model of T2D, that mimic both causality and impact of human
T2D on bone, we provide evidence that T2D increases AGEs, with CML explaining bone
fragility. Similarly, we show that higher serum CML levels are associated with increased risk of
incident clinical and prevalent vertebral fractures in T2D, independent of BMD. Thus, our overall
goal is to establish CML as a new and relevant biomarker of bone fragility and determine how it
contributes to bone fragility in T2D. Using a combination of in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo models
we will pursue the following three aims: Aim 1: Evaluate CML as a putative new biomarker of
bone fragility and determine the mechanism(s) by which it reduces energy dissipation in bone;
Aim 2: Determine the contribution of CML and other AGEs to alterations in bone matrix and
energy dissipation in human T2D vertebrae and cortical and cancellous bone from hip fracture
patients.; Aim 3: Validate CML as a biomarker of T2D bone fragility using obese and non-obese
mouse models of T2D and data from the Health, Aging and Body Composition (ABC) study. Our
findings will provide a new understanding of the mechanism and the effects of CML and other
AGEs on bone fractures leading to new strategies to predict, manage and mitigate T2D and
fragility fractures.

Regulation currently relies heavily on machine-generated emissions to predict harmful and potentially harmful
constituent (HPHC) exposure from using products under review, without a good understanding of how the
product will impact public health under real-world conditions. This study addresses the question of whether
ecig users who currently choose to use lower nicotine eliquids are actually consuming less nicotine compared
to those who choose to use higher nicotine eliquids. We will provide evidence on the extent to which using low
nicotine eliquids reduces one’s overall exposure to HPHC. We will monitor N=120 pod and pen-style regular
ecig users in their natural environment for one week, collecting ambulatory topography data using RIT’s
wPUMTM monitors along with daily salivary cotinine, subject effects and exposure and health effect biomarkers.
Data will be evaluated in the context of the joint effect of product characteristics and behavior on product
emissions and, ultimately, on public health. Aim 1: Evaluate HPHC exposure using the traditional approach of
salivary cotinine, a well-accepted biomarker for nicotine exposure, and other urinary and salivary biomarkers of
exposure and adverse health affect. Aim 2: Evaluate HPHC exposure using a novel alternative outcome
measure we call behavior-based yield, which incorporates one-week of intensive puff-by-puff topography and
product-specific emissions, Aim 3: Add pharmacokinetics to improve the predictive utility of the behavior-
based yield model by incorporating personalized reaction kinetics, which will then be applied to predict the
time-course of salivary cotinine for one-week of natural use. We expect the outcomes to support the
premise that exposure to both nicotine and total particulate matter are important in risk assessment,
and the potential to inadvertently increase one by decreasing the other must be considered when
making product choices and regulatory decisions. This project will; (1) Provide evidence that regulating
nicotine concentration alone does not reduce nicotine uptake, nor reduce adverse health effect; (2) Provide
device-independent evidence that users of lower nicotine eliquids do not consume less nicotine and may
consumer more total particulate matter compared to users of higher nicotine eliquids; (3) Provide evidence
supporting the need for rigorous accounting of behavior when reporting HPHC exposure in PMTA and MRTP
applications; and (4) Provide evidence in support of establishing a causal relationship between tobacco
product characteristics and health effect.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Cerebral cortical development is a highly orchestrated process, with production of neurons destined for the cortical layers produced in order, deep to superficial, followed by glial generation. The timing of this process is very different between species. For example, mouse corticogenesis occurs over approximately a week of gestation, while in humans the process takes several months, resulting in a much larger and more complex cortex. Lineage studies have functionally defined the major types of neural progenitor cells (NPCs) contributing to corticogenesis, including stem cell-like radial glial cells (RGCs) and intermediate progenitor cells (IPCs). However, much remains to be discovered regarding how RGCs and IPCs are specified over time. We have discovered that during asymmetric RGC-IPC cell divisions, the RNA binding protein Stau2 segregates a complex cargo of coding and non-coding RNA specifically into the IPC daughter. Analysis of this cargo at different embryonic stages by RNA-sequencing has revealed networks of genes that are candidates for controlling proliferation and temporal specification of the IPC fate. Here we propose to test these candidates in functional studies, using high-throughput automated time-lapse image analysis for in vitro studies, as well as a novel lentiviral in vivo screening method, to define their roles in specifying IPCs and timing corticogenesis. In contrast to the progress made in understanding the characteristics of mouse cortical progenitor cells, less is understood regarding human cortical progenitors. Fundamental knowledge about how human RGCs and IPCs produce diverse progeny over time, their division mode, cell cycle times and lineages, remains unknown. Here we will address these gaps in knowledge using long-term time-lapse lineage analysis in vitro. In addition, by identifying genes expressed in human cortical progenitor cells, including at the single cell level and via analysis of the Stau2 cargo, we will reveal human cortical progenitor subtypes and heterogeneity. Further, a comparison of human and mouse cortical progenitor cell data will help illuminate key differences to address a major mystery: the difference in timing of mouse and human cortical development. Our lab continues to explore the interaction of environmental factors on cortical progenitor cells, aided by the ability to rapidly quantify changes in proliferation, division mode and differentiation using time-lapse analysis. Soluble factors released by structures in the germinal niche such as vascular endothelial cells and the choroid plexus, act on cortical progenitors to regulate the numbers and types of progeny they produce. Our recent work has identified a panel of candidate niche molecules secreted by the choroid plexus that could interact with receptors expressed on neural progenitors, which we propose to examine in vitro and in vivo, in mouse and human. Defining niche factors and their specific actions paves the way to address diseases that involve degeneration of stem cell zones which are normally active throughout life. Furthermore, defining environmental factors that act on human NPCs is important for translation towards regenerative therapy development.

Decades of study have demonstrated that adult human retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells have strong
proliferative capacity in vitro, which indicates that the RPE layer has the possibility of self-repair. We have shown
that adult RPE from elderly donors or donors with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) can proliferate in
culture and produce a near-native, renewed RPE monolayer. Despite this, RPE cells in vivo do not regenerate
the damaged cobblestone RPE layer in patients with degenerating cells, such as those with dry AMD. The
environment in vivo must effectively prevent repair of the cobblestone RPE monolayer, either through lack of
mitogens or inhibitory molecules or a combination of both. The overarching goal of these studies is to achieve
safe, controlled proliferation of endogenous RPE cells to enable self-repair of the RPE layer in patients with
AMD. The objective of this proposal is to characterize the environmental factors that positively and negatively
control the proliferation of adult human RPE cells. The first specific aim is to characterize the adult human RPE
cell surfaceome on dividing and non-dividing cells using an innovative mass spectrometry and bioinformatic
platform. This will provide the first comprehensive analysis of the molecules on the RPE plasma membrane and
reveal cell surface receptors and secreted proteins that respond to environmental factors impacting cell division.
Investigating both normal and AMD RPE will provide a greater understanding of how RPE cells change with
disease. The second specific aim is to examine a transcriptional network we have identified that is associated
with adult human RPE cell proliferation to determine which molecules are critical. To do this efficiently, we will
first employ CRISPRi, then additional functional screens. The third specific aim will examine whether exogenous
factors can activate proliferation of quiescent, cobblestone human RPE, including those in situ on Bruch’s
membrane explants, and those from patients with AMD. In addition to the main objective, this study will generate
new knowledge about RPE molecules that can be used to target RPE in vivo. The proposed work also has the
potential to improve RPE cell proliferation ex vivo for more efficient cell manufacturing. Most importantly, this
study will create a foundation for safely stimulating RPE cell proliferation in vivo. Endogenous activation of RPE
cell proliferation to counteract RPE cell loss in AMD has the potential to avoid surgery and immunosuppression
involved in RPE cell transplantation, which would greatly benefit the elderly AMD patient population.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Abstract. Given the very limited success in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) drug development over the past decades
an extended search for therapy beyond the amyloid-b and tau hypotheses is needed. According to one promising
and underexplored hypothesis, in AD the key pathophysiological events are linked with brain insulin resistance.
This hypothesis, referred to as Type 3 Diabetes (T3D), is supported by many lines of evidence including altered
insulin pathways in AD brains and cognitive benefits of anti-diabetic drugs. The mechanisms of T3D
pathogenesis remain unknown, however. Extensive research demonstrated that suppression of different nodes
in the growth hormone (GH)/ insulin-like growth factor (IGF)/ mechanistic target of the rapamycin (mTOR)
cascade slows down aging and aging-associated cognitive decline in a range of model organisms. Insulin and
IGF hormonal cascades have a common ancestry and the two axes of hormonal signaling are not fully separated.
Their negative feedback loops overlap, so that activation of IGF-1 receptor (IGF1R) results in suppression of
insulin receptor substrate (IRS) a key node in insulin signaling. Following this evidence, we hypothesize that
chronic activation of a molecular cascade downstream of IGF1 results in a negative feedback
suppression of insulin signaling (Fig. 1) in the brain and T3D development. Additionally, IGF1R negatively
regulates autophagy and positively regulates NF-kB-mediated inflammation providing bridges between T3D,
misfolded proteins, and inflammatory mechanisms of AD and AD-related dementias (ADRD). Informed by this
hypothesis, we have conducted preliminary proof of a principle longevity experiments with mice in which small
molecule IGF1R inhibitors orally administered starting 13 months of age (~45 human years) prevented the
decline of short-term memory, prevented the development of insulin resistance, improved grip strength,
decreased frailty, and increased lifespan. Capitalizing on these results the current proposal will allow us to make
further steps toward the development of AD therapy based on IGF1R inhibition via the following aims: (1) to
optimize drug-candidate molecules via computational modeling and subsequent testing of their target affinity
and selectivity, toxicity properties, absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion characteristics; and (2) to
characterize neurodegeneration prevention by optimized molecules using two mouse models: wildtype
mice naturally developing cognitive decline with age and 3xTg-AD mouse model of AD. The ability of optimized
drugs to improve cognitive function and improve markers of insulin signaling, autophagy, inflammation, Aβ, and
tau pathology in their brains will be analyzed. This project will result in a candidate drug(s) for AD and ADRD,
targeting novel molecular mechanisms and ready for preclinical development.

Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are complex disorders manifested by qualitatively atypical social
communication skills and an aberrant behavioral repertoire that vary in severity across individuals. We lack
neurobiologically-grounded predictors of autism in the general population. Our studies seek to fill this critical
gap in our knowledge about neurobiologically-grounded quantitative signatures that precede manifestations of
ASD in toddlers recruited from the general population. We aim to (i) apply advanced computational analytic
techniques to formally chart the emergence of atypical developmental trajectories, and (ii) uncover and validate
neurobiologically-grounded, clinically meaningful subtypes predictive of future risk for atypical development,
revolutionizing brain imaging in young children. In our previous work we have discovered that head
movements during functional MRI provide an abundant source of useful movement data whose statistical
features are linked to clinical and cognitive outcomes in children and adults diagnosed with ASD. Our recent
studies have revealed that quantitative signatures of atypical learning trajectories can be detected as early as
1-2 months in infants at high familial risk for developing ASD. Atypical functioning of the sensorimotor system
has deleterious functional consequences across diverse domains of learning and development and may
contribute to ASD manifestations, in toddlers screened prospectively in the general population. Using data from
the NIH-funded National Database for Autism Research (NDAR) we will test whether atypical movement
variability during MRI scans during the 2nd year of life in N=212 toddlers from the general population is
predictive of ASD or non-ASD outcomes (vs. typical development, TD) ascertained during the 3rd year. We will
rigorously quantify key kinematic parameters during MRI scans acquired in toddlers ages 12-24 months
according to different conditions, including sleeping or resting, while language is presented to sleeping
toddlers, and also during a socially-orienting scan. We hypothesize that deleterious, context-incongruent
signatures during the 2nd year of life in toddlers will be related subsequently to greater ASD manifestations at
36-48 months. Machine learning algorithms will be used to classify ASD, non-ASD, and TD toddlers. The
overall goal of these studies is to illuminate the neurobiological basis of sensorimotor variability in toddlers from
the general population and to establish that sensorimotor signatures are part and parcel of the child’s future
ASD diagnosis, a finding which will have profound, transformative implications for neuroimaging methods in
young children. This knowledge will provide new, early mechanistic insights into the basis of such associations
recently established in children, adolescents, and adults with and without ASD, as well as in human infants,
and advance Research Priorities of the NIMH.

Nearly all modern drug discovery efforts begin with a virtual screening campaign, and there are
now several drugs available on the market that were originally identified through computational
efforts. Small molecule drug discovery, in particular, has benefited from the integration of
computational chemistry tools that have become capable of the necessary throughput due to
advances in computational power and algorithmic development. Binding free energy
calculations have enhanced the practice of small molecule lead optimization and have helped
expedite the development of effective drugs to transform the healthcare landscape.
Peptide drugs are widely considered to be a promising, yet currently underutilized, class of
drugs due to their high level of tunability with modern synthesis methods. Their large exposed
surface area relative to small molecule drugs supports an increased level of specificity and the
roughly 80 peptide drugs currently available on the market represent some of the highest
therapeutic indices of known drugs. Peptide drugs even offer the opportunity to address targets
that were previously thought to be undruggable.
Peptide drugs are situated to similarly benefit from computational lead optimization strategies,
but the application of existing tools for accelerating discovery efforts is less established than for
small molecule drugs. The barrier for achieving widespread success in computational peptide
lead optimization is two-fold: the increased size of peptide drugs makes the necessary
conformational sampling more challenging, and the diversity in chemical character among
different peptide drugs makes it difficult to fit a reliable classical simulation model. The former
challenge can be overcome through efficient conformational sampling approaches, while the
latter can be addressed by quantum mechanical calculations that avoid the need for a restrictive
fit to analytical models. Overcoming both of these challenges simultaneously requires an
innovative approach, because the solutions to each of them independently have been, until
recently, mutually exclusive.
The objective of the proposed research is to make computational lead optimization reliable for
peptide drug discovery by developing a machine learning-based peptide simulation model that
simultaneously overcomes both of the aforementioned challenges. We will achieve this by
training a machine learning potential on the basis of quantum mechanical simulation data, which
will be implemented on our QSP Life molecular simulation platform for efficiently calculating
peptide binding free energies.

Bathrooms are extremely hazardous for older adults and wheelchair users. Bathroom injuries, many related to
toileting, occur at a rate of 266.6 per100,000 among persons aged ≥85 years and result in costly, injurious falls
and numerous cascading adverse health consequences. Transfer assisting technologies are important tools that
can be used to promote wellness, independence, community participation, and quality of life. New, easy-to-use
technologies that enable more efficient and safer toilet transfers for patients and caregivers are desperately
needed. This SBIR Phase II project proposes to refine and evaluate PPAL®, an assisted toileting device that
enables persons at risk for toileting-related falls to safely transfer with less physical assistance from a caregiver.
The proposed Phase II activities will refine and test theproof-of-concept prototype developed under an NIH
Phase I project by QUA, Inc. PPAL is a patented, motorized, height adjustable bedside commode with integrated
transfer boards. PPAL incorporates a transfer board that moves up and down as the Chair seat is raised or
lowered so that the user can always perform a downhill transfer. This innovation will allow individuals with limited
mobility who currently rely on caregiver assistance to transfer more independently. It will also decrease the risk
of falls and injuries for users and caregivers. Phase I results show that to improve manufacturability and
commercial potential, the initial prototype should offer more appropriate height levels for wheelchair users
(WCUs), added seating and positioning features, and a more maneuverable, sleeker base that can be kept at
bedside. The proposed Phase II study is organized around three aims. In Aim 1, we will develop a pre-production
prototype that enables level and downhill transfers between a wheelchair or bed and the PPAL, is suitable for
institutional and home use, and is designed for manufacturability. This will be accomplished by conducting design
reviews with stakeholders, designing for manufacturability, conducting engineering testing in accordance with
standards, performing in lab evaluations with stakeholders, and revising the prototypes based on feedback
received. In Aim 2, we will assess the usability and utility of PPAL in real-world home settings and short-term
impact on fall/near fall incidence, level of toileting assistance, fear of falling and caregiver burden. The PPAL will
be placed in residences of WCUs and their formal or informal caregivers. Outcomes will be assessed at baseline
and at the conclusion of a 6-week device trial. Aim 3 will develop and validate clinical guidelines for PPAL use.
An interdisciplinary stakeholder group of expert clinicians and Safe Patient Handling and Movement (SPHM)
professionals will be convened to assist with identifying clinical parameters for the safe prescription of the PPAL.
The long-term commercial goal of the project is to provide a toileting solution that will increase user independence
and decrease both user and caregiver injury. The PPAL will be suitable for deployment in homes, skilled nursing
and rehabilitation facilities as well as hospitals.

The goal of the current study is to complete IND enabling studies to develop a therapeutic based on
D6PV, a novel ApoC-II peptide mimetic, by conducting toxicology studies and manufacturing GMP drug
substance and drug product for future Phase 1 trials in normal healthy volunteers. Successful
completion of aims proposed here will result in the development of a novel peptide mimetic as an
intravenous formulation with a rapid onset of action for the treatment of hospitalized patients with acute
pancreatitis to rapidly reduce triglycerides to prevent or treat hypertriglyceridemia, and therefore will
reduce the length of stay in the hospital and reduce or eliminate the morbidity and mortality. A safety
assessment will be completed in IND enabling studies and a NOAEL (no adverse effect load)
determined to support first-in-human dosing. This will enable Protean Bio to advance D6PV for Phase
1 clinical trials in normal healthy volunteers to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of
D6PV after single and multiple ascending dosing regimens. Once completed and demonstrated to be
safe in humans, D6PV is anticipated to progress to Phase 2 trials in hospitalized AP patients for proof-
of-concept (i.e., efficacy) for reducing triglycerides in < 4 hours after administration as an intravenous
dose. AP is one of the most common diagnosis for GI-related hospitalization with significant morbidity
and at an annual cost of $2.6B. Severe Hypertriglyceridemia (SHTG) is a leading cause for AP and is
known to occur in up to 38% of patients with plasma triglyceride (TG) levels of 3000-5000 mg/dL.
Although there are several approved products (e.g., Vascepa®, Epanova®) and new modalities
(nucleic acid drugs, antibodies) in Phase 2/3 trials for the treatment of SHTG, they have a delayed
onset of action, rendering them unsuitable for rapidly lowering triglycerides in hospitalized AP patients.
Therefore, there is a clear unmet need for rapidly addressing elevated TG in AP patients in an acute,
hospitalized setting to reduce pain and progression of pancreatic necrosis, organ failure and mortality.
Superior ex vivo results were confirmed in in vivo studies in mice models of HTG, demonstrating a
~80% reduction of plasma HTG in 3 hours post dosing and ~85% decrease in plasma ApoC-III; the
latter due to displacement by D6PV and subsequent clearance. In this Direct to Phase II grant, we
propose to complete engineering validation of the non-GMP manufacturing process, complete IND-
enabling studies in rat and dog, and manufacture GMP drug substance and drug product.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Recently, WHO and CDC designated Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) a Priority 1 ‘critical
superbug’ and an ‘Urgent Threat’, and warned that new treatments for superbugs, which kill nearly 50,000
Americans and Europeans a year, are unlikely to be developed in time if left to market forces alone. Few
therapeutic options are left to treat CRE, and the fear of ‘pan-resistant’ CRE has emerged. Currently, most CRE
infections occur in a hospital setting, but the potential spread of CRE in the community also exists. Entirely new
agents with novel mechanisms of action languish; completely novel antibacterials with a new mechanism of
action and lacking clinical cross-resistance to existing drug classes are urgently needed. Our proposal aims to
develop a mechanistically novel, IV and PO administered agent to treat uncomplicated and complicated UTI
cases caused by antibiotic susceptible and multidrug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, including extended spectrum
beta-lactamase producers and CRE. Using an innovative overexpression-based co-culture screen in Escherichia
coli (Ec), we identified four structurally distinct series of small molecule inhibitors targeting MsbA, an essential
and broadly conserved Gram-negative (GN) ABC transporter responsible for lipopolysaccharide (LPS)
biogenesis and construction of the Gram-negative outer membrane (OM). A prioritization of the four series
through our current R21AI146541-supported program has enabled selection of a series to enter the Lead
Identification (ID) phase of development. We propose the following aims to develop this series:
Aim 1 (2 years) - Lead ID to select a single lead series with WT activity and efficacy for Aim 2 Lead
Optimization (Op): 1.1) exploratory med chem to improve WT activity, 1.2) obtain high resolution MsbAi-MsbA
X-ray co-crystal structure to guide structure-based drug design (SBBD) using the Schrodinger Discover Suite,
1.3) monitor whole cell (MIC) activity, 1.4) track in vitro IC50 potency, 1.5) test ppb, mammalian cytotoxicity, and
P-gp inhibition/stimulation, 1.6) FOR, time kill curves, and LpxC inhibitor synergy studies, 1.7) measure PK, 1.8)
determine Enterobacteriaceae MIC90, 1.9) synthetic scale up, 1.10) dose-ranging mouse PK/formulation studies,
and 1.11) demonstrate in vivo efficacy in a mouse peritonitis model of WT Ec infection.
Aim 2 (3 years) - Lead Op to prepare a Pre-Clinical Candidate (PCC) for subsequent safety studies: 2.1)
med chem optimization of drug-like properties, 2.2) track MIC, IC50, and cytotoxicity, 2.3) conduct in vitro ADME,
2.4) single mouse (IV, IP, PO) PK, 2.5) validate MOA and FOR, 2.6) test in vitro mammalian off target-activity,
2.7) expanded Enterobacteriaceae MIC90, 2.8) dose-ranging mouse PK, 2.9) synthetic scale up, 2.10) efficacy
in murine UTI model, 2.11) identify PK/PD index, 2.12) expanded off target-activity as in 2.6.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Project Summary Abstract
Mosquitoes infect hundreds of millions of people with deadly pathogens every year. Since mosquitoes
identify humans and other important resources primarily via their sense of smell, the disruption of
mosquito olfactory systems has long been recognized as a potential strategy for controlling these
pathogens. For example, repellants that scramble or block the detection of odors may be used to push
mosquitoes away from humans and the areas where we live and work. Conversely, irresistibly attractive
blends of volatile chemicals may be deployed to pull mosquitoes into lethal traps. Despite some
advances in this area over the past decade, progress has been limited by the fact that the olfactory
systems of our most important vector mosquitoes remain largely uncharacterized. We know that
mosquitoes detect odors using tens to hundreds of ligand-specific olfactory receptors expressed in
approximately 60 different types of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) found on their antennae and
maxillary palps. But we don’t yet know exactly which neurons mosquitoes rely on for detecting humans,
flowers, and oviposition sites, nor which receptors are expressed in those neurons. Moreover, exciting
preliminary data from our lab and others indicates that the 1-to-1 matching between receptors and
sensory neurons observed in Drosophila vinegar flies does not apply in mosquitoes. Instead, mosquito
sensory neurons appear to express multiple, ligand-specific receptors. This means that the tuning of the
neurons that drive behavior cannot be equated to the tuning of individual receptors and thus helps to
explain why previous receptor-focused studies have largely failed to unlock the logic of mosquito host
attraction. Here, we propose to characterize the molecular and functional properties of all major OSN cell
types on the antennae of the arbovirus vector mosquito Aedes aegypti. In Aim 1, we will conduct single-
nucleus RNA sequencing of antennal neurons to identify putative OSN cell types and the receptors
expressed therein. In Aim 2, we will use CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing to generate OSN type-specific
expression drivers that can be used to match OSN types to their target glomeruli in the antennal lobe of
the brain. In Aim 3, we will use in vivo antennal lobe imaging to characterize the tuning of a subset of
OSN types to a panel of 200-300 biologically relevant odorants and natural blends. Taken together we
expect to generate a receptor-neuron-glomerulus map for this important disease vector and a library of
genetic tools with which to manipulate it—facilitating the identification of the neurons that drive behavior
and opening the door to the efficient and rational design of chemical repellants and attractants for use in
vector control.

Dynamin GTPases have critical roles in mediating endocytosis by wrapping around the neck of budding vesicles
to catalyze membrane fission necessary for the release of nascent vesicles from the plasma membrane.
Recently, we discovered a novel role for dynamin in bundling numerous actin filaments, which has implications
for actin-mediated processes, such as cell-cell fusion and migration. While structural and biophysical studies
have elucidated the mechanism of dynamin assembly and constriction of membranes, several unanswered
questions remain including how dynamin is actually organized and mediates fission within cells, how dynamin
forms the final pre-fission state where it wraps around lipid tubules in a superconstricted state, how dynamin
binds substrates via the proline rich domain (PRD), and how substrate binding regulates dynamin activity. The
long-term objective of this application is to elucidate the mechanism of dynamin-mediated membrane fission
from in vitro and in vivo studies, and to define the mechanism of dynamin interaction with actin and SH3 domain-
containing proteins that recruit dynamin to sites of endocytosis. These objectives will be addressed by the
following specific aims: (1) determine the atomic model of dynamin in the superconstricted prefission state
and define the structure of the PRD; (2) investigate the assembly of the dynamin helical polymer on membranes
within cells; and (3) Elucidate the mechanism of PRD interaction with actin filaments and SH3 domain-containing
binding partners. The rationale for these aims is that: (1) there is no atomic model describing the structural
basis by which dynamin constricts membranes to 3.4 nm in the superconstricted state where spontaneous
hemifission and membrane fission occurs; (2) how dynamin is actually organized in cells has not been reported;
and (3) the structure of the critical PRD and how it binds dynamin substrates including actin, amphiphysin and
intersectin is unknown. The research design and methods are as follows : Aim 1, Apply cryo-electron
microscopy (cryo-EM) to determine the structure of full-length dynamin (containing the PRD) organized around
lipid tubules in the superconstricted state; Aim 2, obtain cryo-electron tomograms and subtomogram averages
of dynamin within cells transfected with a GTPase-deficient dynamin mutant which delays membrane fission and
extends the lifetime of dynamin helices on cellular membranes; Aim 3, obtain the cryo-EM structure of actin
filaments decorated with PRD from dynamin, as well as complexes of dynamin/amphiphysin and
dynamin/intersectin. This work is of

Emerging evidence indicates that women are more likely to use a multipurpose prevention technology (MPT) for
pregnancy and HIV/STI infection prevention than a product for pregnancy or HIV/STI infection prevention. The
MPT development space is dominated by products that contain one or more hormonal contraceptives, which
many women, including breastfeeding women, cannot or will not use. Amphora gel is an exception. Ampphora
is a non-hormonal, vaginally-acting contraceptive product for women being developed by Evofem Biosciences
Inc. It works by maintaining a low vaginal pH that is hostile to sperm, bacteria, and viruses. Evofem recently
completed a Phase 3 contraceptive efficacy trial of Amphora that indicated typical use efficacy of 86.0% and per
protocol efficacy (perfect use) of 98.7%, comparable to the efficacy of the most commonly used forms of
hormonal contraception, oral pills. Amphora is currently being tested in Phase 2b trials for prevention of
urogenital chlamydia and gonorrhea in women and preparing for trials for prevention of recurrent bacterial
vaginosis (BV), which has completed enrollment. QGRFT is a stable analog of the non-antiretroviral (non-ARV)
anti-HIV lectin griffithsin (GRFT). We completed a Phase 1 trial of a vaginally administered GRFT gel, and
with PATH developed a novel vaginally administered GRFT fast dissolving insert (FDI) that significantly
prevented simian human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) infection in macaques and HSV-2 and HPV infection in
mice. Our long term goal is to develop an Amphora/QGRFT FDI for adolescent girls and a wide range of women,
including breastfeeding women, which provides non-hormonal contraception and reduces the risk of acquiring a
broad range of viral and bacterial STIs. Herein we will evaluate the feasibility, safety, and in vivo efficacy of two
innovative MPT prototypes: an Amphora/QGRFT FDI that could have contraceptive and anti-HIV/STI/BV
properties and an Amphora-only FDI that could have contraceptive and anti-STI/BV properties. The
prototypes will be manufactured and then evaluated in a series of in vitro assays, physiochemical
property/stability evaluations, and in vivo studies to demonstrate FDI disintegration, drug retention in the vagina,
safety, anti-HIV activity (pharmacodynamics studies in a macaque model and in vivo efficacy in macaques) and
anti-HSV-2 activity (murine model). The Amphora/QGFRT FDI may offer more potent anti-HSV-2 activity than
Amphora alone due to QGRFT’s anti-HSV-2 activity. Using data obtained in these studies, we will select one FDI
to advance into contraceptive efficacy testing in rabbits and IND-enabling toxicology studies in rats. The novel
non-hormonal FDI proposed here could (i) eliminate side effects associated with hormonal contraceptives, (ii)
meet the needs of women who have infrequent sex or who are breastfeeding, and (iii) reduce the sexual
acquitision of HIV/STIs and the emergence of ARV-resistant HIV. This woman-initiated FDI has the potential to
improve women’s health and advance the MPT field. When approved, the FDI would be the first non-hormonal,
on-demand and event-driven MPT with both contraceptive and broad spectrum anti/HIV/STI properties.

 Despite advances in sequencing, imaging and screening technologies, morphological changes in nuclear
structure are still utilized as a common and reliable diagnosis of cancer. Healthy cells invariably have ellipsoid,
smooth nuclear shape and distinctive chromatin distribution, while cancerous cells are characterized by irregular,
jagged nuclear shape and disrupted chromatin distribution. Relatedly, one of the most commonly mutated
proteins in human cancers is a component of the chromatin remodeler BAF complex known as ARID1A. These
mutations lose nucleosome sliding activity, leading to altered transcriptome and cancer progression. As a
structural scaffold of the BAF complex, many of the mutations in ARID1A that cause cancer result in early
truncation and lead to loss of BAF complex assembly. However, driver mutations also exist in the relatively
uncharacterized intrinsically disordered regions of ARID1A whose molecular mechanism is unknown.
 Investigations into nuclear organization have identified the importance of intrinsically disordered regions
and phase separation in dictating overall nuclear structure and organization, as well as forming nuclear bodies
like the nucleolus, and chromatin compartments like heterochromatin, but until recently we have not been able
to control this organization, or link it conclusively to chromatin compartment function. The Brangwynne lab has
developed optogenetic tools that allow for control of in vivo biophysical behavior of condensates.
 As a Life Science Research Fellow through the Mark Foundation for Cancer Research, I have determined
the role of chromatin-chromatin crosslinking protein HP1a in determining nuclear shape and mechanics, as well
as discovered rules for chromatin inclusion, exclusion, and compaction dictated by phase separated
compartments. In this proposal I will expand my research to understand the biophysical changes that occur in
these nuclear compartments upon ARID1A mutations that drive cancer, and how this is connected to their
disease phenotype. In Aim 1, I will interrogate interactions that dictate how condensates interact with chromatin,
and utilize light-triggered phase separation to modulate chromatin compaction and transcription in living cells. In
Aim 2, I will determine how the chromatin polymer directs phase separation, and how nuclear stiffness influences
nuclear body volume and functional output. In Aim 3, under the guidance of my co-mentor Dr. Cigall Kadoch, I
will utilize knowledge gained in Aims 1 and 2 to build a molecular mechanism of BAF complex proteins ARID1A
and ARID1B in oncogenesis, including the roles of their IDRs in targeting BAF complex activity and effects of
cancer-associated mutations on condensation behavior, sequence targeting and transcriptional output.
 With the support of my mentors and the greater research environment at both Princeton University and
the Dana Farber Cancer Institute, I will have access to unique tools, and will receive training in cancer biology
methods, biophysical theory, and next-generation sequencing assays. Together, these aims will provide a new
perspective on nuclear organization in cancer that may lead to novel venues of therapeutics.

 Cognitive functions of the brain are underpinned by complex and highly dynamic neural activities at the
sub-cellular levels and millisecond time scales. To discover the normal/abnormal neuronal activities and thus
understand detailed mechanisms of neurological disorders and dysfunctions such as Alzheimer’s,
Parkinson’s disease and ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis), measurement tools that offer sufficient
spatiotemporal resolution are needed. Fluorescence imaging/microscopy is one of the state-of-the-art
technologies for high spatial resolution recording of the activity of neuron populations. However, existing
fluorescence neural imaging technologies generally have limited speed, providing less than a few hundred
frames per second at most. High-speed imaging is particularly challenging for miniaturized, head-mounted
imagers used for in vivo studies on freely-behaving animals. The milliseconds or slower temporal resolution
substantially precludes measuring the precise timing of the generation and propagation of neuron spikes,
which is the key component of neural signaling. Moreover, current head-mounted fluorescence imagers use
epi-fluorescence illumination, which cannot reject out-of-focus background fluorescence, resulting in low
discrimination of voltage-sensitive signals from the thin membranes of individual neurons.
 During this R&D program, Physical Sciences Inc. (PSI) and the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard
propose to develop and demonstrate a high-speed (>kHz frame rate), head-mounted, confocal imager
that can optically capture neuronal electrical activity with high spatiotemporal details. Technology
innovations are proposed to enable this capability. First, an “active sensing” signal detection method
combines two complementary imaging channels to achieve parallel neuronal recording with both sub-micron
spatial resolution and sub-millisecond temporal resolution. Second, a novel hybrid fiber bundle scanning
approach achieves confocal imaging capability based on a miniaturized optical setup. During the proposed
Phase I, we will demonstrate the feasibility of the technology by imaging cultured neurons and brain slices
labeled with voltage fluorescent indicators. Then, we will upgrade the technology to a miniaturized imager to
further demonstrate its performance during in vivo imaging of mice. These test experiments will demonstrate
high spatiotemporal resolution recording of fast action potentials from individual neurons and sub-cellular
neuron structures (e.g., dendrites and synapses). This R&D project will result in a robust technology for non-
invasive recording of neuronal kinetics with high spatiotemporal resolution on freely-behaving animals,
offering a critical tool for neuroscience research.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：The neural crest is a multipotent embryonic cell population that gives rise to most of the craniofacial skeleton,
including cartilage, bone and connective tissue. Misregulation of neural crest development results in the vast
majority of craniofacial malformations and birth defects. Thus, uncovering the molecular and genetic
underpinnings of neural crest formation has important implications for the diagnosis and treatment of these
pathologies. Neural crest development is orchestrated by a multi-level gene regulatory network, in which
progenitor cells are progressively committed to a neural crest fate. This process requires not only shifts in gene
expression but also an extensive remodeling of the epigenomic landscape. The chromatin remodeling events
which occur between two respective stages of neural crest formation, induction and specification, are driven in
part by the action of the pioneer factor TFAP2A. TFAP2A activates distinct sets of genomic regions during
induction and specification of neural crest cells, and its target specificity is dependent upon its dimerization with
paralogous proteins TFAP2C and TFAP2B. This heterodimeric switch between TFAP2A/C and TFAP2A/B acts
to drive the transition from induction to specification, allowing for progressive cell fate commitment of neural
crest cells. Consistent with this idea, TFAP2B expression is both necessary and sufficient to drive the transition
from induction to specification. Analysis of an enhancer of TFAP2B has implicated SMAD2/3 nuclear effectors
as predicted drivers of TFAP2B expression. This observation has led to the hypothesis that TFAP2 pioneer
factors integrate environmental signals into the gene regulatory network to drive the transition from induction to
specification within the neural crest lineage. The F99 phase of this proposal aims to investigate the role of
SMAD nuclear effectors and their upstream signaling systems in the control of TFAP2B expression and
consequently the neural crest specification program. This work will shed light on how environmental stimuli act
to remodel the chromatin landscape within the presumptive neural crest.
Moreover, while much focus has been paid to understand the cis-regulatory control of neural crest cell
formation, we still have very little insight on the molecular mechanisms by which these cells differentiate to
form the bone and cartilage of the face. Single-cell analysis of chromatin accessibility in neural crest
differentiation will allow for the identification of enhancer elements specific to numerous facial compartments.
Furthermore, identification of compartment-specific drivers will reveal how these regulatory factors act to
orchestrate the formation of highly complex and nuanced structures within the craniofacial skeleton. Ultimately,
this data may be used to gain a mechanistic understanding of the etiology of congenital birth defects linked to
the misregulation of craniofacial morphogenesis.

 Aggression is a key aspect of animal social life, playing critical roles in territorial defense, resource
acquisition, and protection of offspring. Like other behaviors, aggression is reinforced through experience.
This reinforcement often serves beneficial purposes, improving territory defense and protection of offspring –
vital behaviors for individual and species survival. However, experience can also promote pathological levels
of persistent aggression. In humans, this can harm an individual’s mental health and put others at risk. Thus,
there is a need for improved treatment options based on an individual’s prior and on-going history with
aggression. Accordingly, my goal is to identify how aggressive experience alters neural circuit computations
to generate persistent aggressive behavior. Specifically, this work will probe how experience changes
synaptic connectivity and neural activity between two subcortical regions that play critical roles in social
behavior: the ventrolateral ventromedial hypothalamus (VMHvl) and medial preoptic area (MPOA). The
VMHvl neural activity is necessary and sufficient for aggressive behavior. The MPOA is an influential node
regulating many social behaviors and sends the largest source of GABAergic input to the VMHvl.
Nevertheless, the role of the MPOA in aggression is enigmatic, and it remains unknown if MPOA inhibitory
input to VMHvl can shut down, or gate, aggression or how social experience affects this circuit. To study the
MPOA VMHvl circuit, this proposal combines: (1) ex vivo brain slice electrophysiology for optogenetic-
assisted circuit mapping and quantification of experience-dependent changes in synaptic strength within the
MPOA VMHvl circuit; (2) cell-type and pathway specific calcium recordings in socially interacting mice ; (3)
novel algorithms for tracking animal posture dynamics and subsequent methods for unsupervised behavior
detection and quantification; and, (4) in vivo optogenetic manipulations to identify the changes in circuit
function that link aggressive experience to future persistent aggression. Aim 1 tests the ability of aggressive
experience to relax the strength of the synaptic connections between MPOA GABAergic (MPOAvgat) input to
distinct, genetically-identified populations of VMHvl neurons. Aim 2 determines if aggressive experience
increases in vivo aggression-related VMHvl population activity. Finally, Aim 3 tests the ability of MPOAvgat
neurons to gate aggression before and after aggressive experience. Taken together, these experiments will
achieve the long-term objective of identifying novel circuit and synaptic treatment targets for aggression-
related pathologies based on patients’ behavioral history. Completion of this fellowship will achieve Dr.
Guthman’s training goals, providing her with experimental expertise in systems neuroscience to complement
her current command of single neuron synaptic physiology. The proposed plan will provide her with the
training to tackle social neuroscience research questions from synapse to behavior.

dimensional space is critical for proper gene expression and genome maintenance. Of note are topologically-
associated domains (TADs) containing neighborhoods of insulated chromatin loop regions bound by clustered
cohesin and CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) homodimers. The integrity and maintenance of these insulated
neighborhoods are important as disruptions to loop structure can result in gene misregulation and proto-
oncogene activation. However, current biochemical tools are insufficiently developed to study questions
concerning the mechanism of neighborhood formation, regulation and dynamics. Thus, we need molecular tools
that enable real-time, high-resolution analysis with minimal pertubation on cellular function.
 This proposal will combine molecular biology tools with the knowledge of photochemistry to develop
an optogenetic tool for labeling the molecular interactome within live cells. A genetically-encodable
photocatalytic protein (SOPP) is used to generate reactive intermediates from a biotin-appended probe that in
turn, covalently tag biomolecular interactions within radial distance of protein localization. Preliminary
experiments nuclear proteins can be labeled with high temporal specificity using short irradiation times. I
anticipate that this method will be applied towards mapping the protein interactomes of other organelles, using
quantitative proteomic data as further confirmation of this method. Conditional systems for proximity labeling
using split-SOPP (sSOPP) will be developed for proximity-gated microenvironment mapping. Finally, SOPP-
activatable chemical probes with different reactivities and radial labeling radius will be synthesized and validated.
 Using this new optogenetic proximity labeling tool, the three-dimensional architecture of chromatin will be
mapped using nuclease dead Cas9 (dCas9)-SOPP fusions guided to genomic sites using defined signal guide
RNAs (sgRNAs). SOPP-CTCF and SOPP-cohesin fusions will be used to map multisite interactions. This
approach should provide insight into the dynamics of factors that engage genes within insulated regions.
Additionally, using the sSOPP approach for proximity-gated CTCF-cohesin labeling will provide a more accurate
picture of loop region interactomics. Lastly, the dCas9-SOPP technology will be used to study the differences in
the interactome of intact and disrupted proto-oncogene containing loops, especially with regard to the factors
involved in gene regulation. As a more holistic approach to mapping molecular interatomics, an orthogonal
nucleic acid labeling method will be adapted to this workflow to create a multiplexed system capable of mapping
both protein and nucleic acid chromatin neighborhood loop interactomes in live cells.
 Successful completion of the proposed research will provide a new optogenetic tool that will be used
by the broader epigenetics community to understand the causative impacts of higher-order
chromosomal architecture on gene regulation, and their role in cancer development and progression.

Bacteria are bombarded by infecting viruses, called phages, in natural habitats. Upon infection of a host, phages
must undertake one of two lifestyles: lysogeny where the phage remains in the host and is passed down to
offspring, or lysis where the phage replicates, kills the host, and spreads to new cells. Phages have been thought
to transition from lysogeny to lysis exclusively in response to host stress and DNA damage. New research from
the Bassler laboratory has revealed that phages can monitor host communication molecules, called
autoinducers. In a process called quorum sensing, bacteria produce, release, and detect autoinducers, and in
response, orchestrate group behaviors. Quorum-sensing-responsive phages detect host-produced autoinducers
and exploit the information they garner to drive their lysis-lysogeny lifestyle transitions. These recent findings
position me to discover how phages manipulate bacterial hosts and the consequences to the host, to the multi-
species bacterial community of which the host is a member, and to the eukaryotic host in which all the entities
reside. The overarching goal of my research is to define how cross-domain communication between vibriophage
VP882, the first phage discovered to “eavesdrop” on quorum sensing, and its host, the global pathogen Vibrio
cholerae, launches the phage lytic cycle. Using a combination of genetic, biochemical, and structural
approaches, I will identify the molecular mechanisms underlying this host-phage chemical communication
process. First, I will learn skills in bacterial genetics from experts in the Bassler laboratory and conduct a genetic
screen to identify the repressor of the quorum-sensing-induced phage lytic cycle. Second, I will use biochemical
methods to quantitatively characterize interactions between two key signaling components in the quorum-
sensing-induced phage lysis pathway. Lastly, I will rely on my background in structural biology to solve the
structures of these same signaling components, individually and in complex, enabling atomic-level-resolution
understanding of the interactions required for the phage to undergo lifestyle transitions. The ideal outcomes of
my research are a mechanistic understanding of inter-domain chemical communication and new possibilities for
development of phage therapies. Honing my skills in bacterial genetics, protein biochemistry, and
macromolecular crystallography over the course of my postdoctoral training will enable me to launch an
independent research program at a top-tier research institution.

One debilitating feature of aging is the loss of cognitive abilities, especially memory decline. Alzheimer’s
disease reduces the healthspan of patients, resulting in a loss of independence and social relationships. The
disease is also financially burdensome to patients and society. Despite the increase in the prevalence of
Alzheimer’s disease, the mechanisms that underlie aberrant memory function are unclear, making the
treatment of memory decline challenging. It is well established that the CREB transcription factor is required for
long-term memory; however, not all factors involved in CREB-dependent long-term memory formation are
known yet. Identifying factors upstream and downstream in the CREB cascade could reveal new mechanisms
for the treatment and reversal of Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias. To identify new candidates that
function within the CREB pathway and regulate long-term memory consolidation, this proposal will examine the
role of specific nuclear factors (Aim 1), small non-coding RNAs (Aim 2), and glial factors (Aim 3) in CREB-
dependent long-term memory. Nuclear factors regulate gene transcription, so identifying which factors
modulate memory formation is critical. Small RNAs regulate gene expression transcriptionally and post-
transcriptionally, but their function in adult neurons and, in turn memory, has not been tested. Glia have
recently been implicated in memory, but how they support memory consolidation is largely unexplored. We are
using the well-established aging model system C. elegans to determine where and how these factors function
to regulate memory with age. Our lab has shown that the memory machinery, including the CREB requirement
for long-term memory consolidation, is conserved in C. elegans and we developed behavioral assays to test
learning and short-term and long-term associative memory. C. elegans serves as a powerful system to
investigate the molecular mechanisms of memory. There are ample genetic tools available, and, with the
worm’s simple nervous system, mechanisms by which candidate genes regulate memory can be easily
probed. By using behavioral assays, tissue-specific isolation techniques, and transcriptomic approaches, these
experiments will determine where and how specific nuclear factors, small RNAs, and glial factors function
within the CREB pathway to regulate memory formation with age. This proposal examines multiple facets of
CREB-dependent long-term memory and will identify new candidates and pathways required for memory
formation. These findings could lead to better therapeutics for reversing or treating age-related cognitive
decline in cases of neurodegenerative disease, including Alzheimer’s. The proposed research plan will provide
the applicant with extensive training in behavioral, molecular, and tissue-specific transcriptomic approaches to
study memory with age. The training in these techniques and the proposed individualized mentorship plan will
ensure the applicant is prepared for a career as an independent investigator, studying mechanisms of memory
and age-related cognitive decline.

the United States alone, over 100,000 new patients have been diagnosed with melanoma in 2021. While
plastic surgeons are frequently responsible for the oncologic reconstruction and removal of melanoma, few
surgeons in this field have the basic science training needed to understand the underlying molecular defects of
this condition or the dynamics of the mammalian epidermal microenvironment, in which they specialize. Such
knowledge is crucial for a holistic approach to the field of plastic surgery because the dysregulation of
intercellular communication between cells in this skin microenvironment, such as melanocytes, fibroblasts, and
keratinocytes, leads to various aesthetic and life altering defects such as those seen in vitiligo, keloid formation
and melanoma. We believe that a better understanding of developmental melanoblast migration can provide a
framework for future patient interventions and provide much needed context for future surgeons. This belief is
supported by recent studies in human melanoma, which show that the transcriptomic genetic profile of
melanoma cells closely mimic developmental melanoblasts. Second, it is well established that one of the
hallmarks of malignant melanoma is the loss of E-cadherin and upregulation of N-cadherin, but how adhesive
interactions between melanocytes and their surrounding keratinocytes via E-cadherin regulate melanocyte
behavior and homeostasis is not well understood. I hypothesize that melanocytes form specialized adhesions
with keratinocytes that serve to maintain the epidermal barrier while simultaneously promoting melanocyte
migration, colonization, and retention within the epidermis. I plan to test this hypothesis, by using the Cre-Lox
system under the control of a K14 epithelial promoter to selectively label melanocytes and knockout E-cadherin
in the keratinocyte microenvironment of the epidermis. I will then characterize the impact of disrupted
melanocyte-epithelial adhesions on melanocyte migration, protrusivity and colonization (Aim 1), identify the
composition and localization of melanocyte-epidermal adhesions and actin regulators (Aim 2) and determine
the impact of disrupted melanocyte-epithelial AJs on melanoma progression in a melanoma mouse model (Aim
3). This proposed project will be the first of its kind to characterize the impact of the surrounding keratinocyte
microenvironment on melanoblast migration and function; thus, seeing the epidermis as a complex
microenvironment with varying cell types, a biological reality that is often overlooked in medical training. This
proposed project and the training plan herein is designed to cultivate the necessary training to provide an
increase in translational research to the field of plastic surgery. This collaboration between Princeton University
and Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital Department of Plastic Surgery provides the clinical, basic
science training, mentorship, and resources necessary to accomplish this goal. It is our hope that this work will
be used to benefit patients with a history of melanoma worldwide.

Human Cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a herpesvirus whose seroprevalence and disease burden remain high
worldwide. While disease is often mild in immunocompetent individuals, it is often severe for
immunocompromised individuals, and congenital infection remains a leading cause of birth defects. There is
currently no vaccine or permanent effective anti-viral therapy against HCMV. The host enzyme telomerase,
which maintains telomeres to protect the integrity of DNA, is key for cell survival and has been implicated in
several diseases including cancer. Telomerase has been implicated as an important agent in the life cycles
and potential oncogenic activity of several herpesviruses, and recently has been shown to be hyperactive in
response to active HCMV infection. Furthermore, telomerase inhibition has been associated with a significant
reduction of viral infectivity in laboratory and clinical strains of HCMV. However, the significance of telomerase
in the HCMV viral life cycle, and the potential therapeutic implications of this relationship, remain unexplored.
We hypothesize host telomerase is important for the HCMV viral life cycle. We will first establish telomerase
activity upregulation upon HCMV infection, and reduced HCMV replication following telomerase inhibition, in
multiple strains and cell lines using several approaches to telomerase repression. Assays of telomerase
activity in the presence of pharmaceutical telomerase inhibitors BIBR1532 and MST-312 will establish a
reduction of viral infectivity following telomerase inhibition in both laboratory and clinical strains. Subsequent
assays using inducible genetic inhibitors, specifically siRNA and inducible shRNA constructs against hTERT,
will test whether reduction of viral replication is a result of telomerase inhibition and not off-target effects. To
define the mechanism of action by which HCMV upregulates telomerase activity, we will assess telomerase
activity following ectopic expression and shRNA-mediated knockdown of key viral genes, and implicated gene
products will be subjected to binding assays in infected and telomerase-inhibited infected conditions to assess
association with DNA via ChiP and QTIP assays, and with other proteins via IP and mass spectrometry. ChiP
assays in infected and telomerase-inhibited infected conditions will also be performed on host proteins
previously shown to influence telomerase activity. To define the function of telomerase in the viral life cycle, we
will conduct differentially-timed inhibition of telomerase and assess the viral gene class(es) the activity of which
is constrained by the absence of telomerase. Overall, these experiments will establish the potential clinical
relevance of telomerase in HCMV infection and define both the mechanism of action by which HCMV
upregulates telomerase activity and the function of telomerase in the viral life cycle. Increased understanding
of these relationships may provide insight into other herpesviruses, inform clinical HCMV management, and
lead to new anti-viral therapies.

Categorization is a fundamental aspect of human cognition that allows for efficient learning, generalization, and
communication. Throughout development, humans categorize the objects, people, and events around them.
The proposed work examines social categorization with a focus on gender. Gender categories are early
emerging, yet influential throughout the lifespan. Broader societal ideas about gender appear to be changing,
however, and this grant asks how those changes may or may not be reflected in how adolescents are
categorizing gender, their beliefs about gender, and their self-categorization by gender. Using a pair of
longitudinal studies, including a 5-year annual study (ongoing from the previous grant period) and a month-long
daily experience sampling study, this grant will document how these constructs are or are not changing
amongst adolescents and the relation between these constructs and their social environments. Finally, in this
work, we examine the links between adolescents’ beliefs about gender, self-categorization with gender, and
their health and well-being. Participants include adolescents and adults who are gender diverse and cisgender.
Together this work will advance theory and practice about topics ranging from categorization and adolescent
gender development to reducing mental health disparities in transgender youth.

Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection results in 887,000 deaths annually. The central challenge in curing
HBV is eradication of the stable covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) form of the viral genome, which
depends on elusive host factors for its generation. Using a yeast extract screen, we identified five core
components of lagging strand synthesis –PCNA, the replication factor C (RFC) complex, DNA polymerase δ
(POLδ), FEN-1, and DNA ligase 1 (LIG1) – as essential for cccDNA formation. We reconstituted cccDNA
formation with purified human homologs, establishing these as a minimal set of factors necessary and
sufficient for cccDNA formation. We further demonstrated that inhibiting POLδ significantly diminishes
cccDNA formation. In this proposal, we will build on these findings to determine the precise kinetics of
cccDNA formation, delineating the role of each factor at every step of the repair process. In understanding the
dynamics of rcDNA to cccDNA repair, we can identify potential rate-limiting steps that could be novel
therapeutic targets for disrupting cccDNA formation and maintenance. Using a series of innovative techniques
in both cell culture and mouse model systems, we will be able to test our findings in physiologically relevant
platforms that will strengthen the impact of our data. Factors found to be critical for rc- to cccDNA
conversion will be disrupted in these systems by a degron-mediated approach that will allow for fine-tuned
control of expression to alleviate any potential cytotoxicity. We can then monitor the effect of each factor in
turn on cccDNA formation or the maintenance of established cccDNA pools in chronically infected cells. To
increase the resolution of such studies, we will also examine at the single-cell level how the expression levels
of a given factor correlate with that of cccDNA. Altogether, these data will give us a far more comprehensive
view of this process critical to the persistence of HBV in chronically infected individuals.

Cancer genomics has transformed the study and treatment of cancer. Nevertheless, the interpretation of
genetic alterations observed in tumor samples remains a major challenge in both basic science and clinical
settings. The functional roles of the vast majority of somatic alterations observed within cancer cells are
unknown: it is typically not known if a specific mutation plays a role in cancer growth or anti-cancer immune
response, or what impact (if any) an observed alteration has on cellular pathways. These gaps in knowledge
are major impediments towards personalized cancer treatments, from uncovering actionable mutations that
can be targeted by drugs to designing personalized cancer neoantigen vaccines. Further, for diverse
population groups to reap the benefits of cancer genomics, it is critical to develop computational methods that
explicitly consider genome variation and that are designed to identify and potentially mitigate inequities. Our
long-term goal is to develop computational approaches that work well across diverse populations in identifying
medically relevant alterations within cancer genomes. We have developed a powerful suite of methods to
discover cancer driver genes based upon integrating observed somatic mutations with knowledge about
cellular networks and a multidimensional view of protein functionality at the level of individual sites. We will
build upon on our prior work by devising machine learning approaches to predict which specific somatic
mutations within genes drive cancer, along with software to visualize and interpret mutations with respect to
newly derived protein functional features. We will introduce integrative formulations to uncover the impact of
somatic alterations on downstream genes and pathways. We will devise approaches to uncover immune-
relevant somatic mutations based on predicting interactions between major histocompatibility complex proteins
and peptides mutated in cancer. We will design our approaches to be effective as well as equitable across the
diversity of human populations. We will release open-source implementations of the developed computational
methods. This project will advance the state-of-the-art in computational methods for interpreting cancer
genomes, deepen our understanding of cancer biology, and move the field further towards unlocking the
promise of personalized cancer treatments in an equitable manner.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is an important and underreported infectious disease, causing chronic infection in ~58
million people worldwide. The CDC estimates there are ~67,000 new cases of HCV every year in the US and
about 20,000 deaths annually, making HCV more deadly than 60 other infectious diseases combined, including
HIV. However, the underlying mechanisms that lead to chronic HCV infection followed by end-stage liver disease
are poorly understood. Although chronic hepatitis C can now be effectively treated with direct-acting antivirals, a
vaccine to prevent transmission remains a high priority due to extreme treatment costs (up to $50,000 for a 12-
week course) and the irreversibility of virally induced liver damage even in “cured” individuals. Efforts to better
understand HCV and develop effective vaccines have been limited by the lack of small animal models for this
virus, which only robustly infects humans and chimpanzees. In the proposed work, we will build on our substantial
research findings to meet this need for an immunocompetent animal model that will allow us to not only
systematically analyze the molecular basis of barriers to interspecies HCV transmission but also how such a
model could be leveraged for assessing vaccine candidates. Towards this end, we recently identified a highly
murine-adapted HCV variant, coined Mad18, with increased replicative capacity in primary murine hepatocytes,
which historically only poorly support HCV replication. Through continued passaging of Mad18 in HCV entry
factor transgenic (EFT) mice with impaired antiviral signaling (EFT Stat1-/-), we aim to further adapt this variant
to a murine physiological environment and define the underpinning biological mechanism (Aim 1). Our
considerable experience with studying viral infections in genetically humanized mice will be utilized to also study
Mad18 and its derivatives in a variety of new mouse lines, including immunocompetent models, with targeted
changes to increase their support of HCV infection (Aim 2). Our observations of persistent HCV infection in
hepatocytes from immunocompetent HCV entry factor knock-in mice that also express human TRIM26 (EFT
TRIM26[h/h]) put us in a strong position for these in vivo studies.
The Ploss lab has made many seminal contributions to the field and will be aided in this important work by our
long-standing collaborators Drs. Schwartz (Weill Cornell) and Pietschmann (Twincore, Germany). Our work will
advance the field of HCV research by making progress in deciphering the mechanism underlying the
exquisitely narrow host tropism and the development of small animal models suitable for studying HCV
infection and immune responses, a necessary precursor to improving treatment and developing vaccines.

Life is a complex and dynamics process that relies on intricate spatiotemporal interactions among molecules and
subcellular organelles within cells and multicellular organisms. Recent advances in light sheet fluorescence
microscopy (LSFM), have greatly expanded our capability to visualize, track and quantify these dynamic
interactions with high-resolution across all four dimensions (4D) of spacetime with minimum invasiveness and
photobleaching. Notable among the LSFM technologies is the lattice light sheet microscopy (LLSM), which
excels at 4D subcellular dynamics imaging with resolution, speed, and non-invasiveness superior to the widely
used confocal microscopy. However, the adoption of LSFM in biomedical research remains limited due to its
incompatibility with widely used sample holders such as multi-well plates or microfluidic chips. LSFM, when
operated in an inverted open-top configuration with two orthogonal high numerical aperture (NA) objectives,
experiences complex optical aberrations that severely degrade image quality. Significant efforts, including
specialized sample holder, single-objective architecture, and adaptive optics, have been devoted, but they are
either technically demanding or suffer from various performance drawbacks. A compact, high-performance, cost-
effective, and user-friendly LSFM system that suits the widely used sample holders has yet to be developed.
This proposal aims to address this crucial incompatibility between LSFM and high-throughput imaging by
leveraging recent advances in optical metasurfaces. These microfabricated 2D metasurfaces consisting of
nanoscale plasmonic arrays with subwavelength periodicity are capable of shaping light with an unprecedented
level of complexity and precision. We will develop an inverted open-top LLSM system with integrated optical
metasurfaces that is compatible with conventional high-throughput sample holders for imaging of molecular and
subcellular dynamics within live cells and multicellular organisms. In addition, we will create an open-source
computational pipeline to facilitate the design and fabrication of optical metasurfaces for user-defined open-top
LSFM configurations. Our proposed system will provide a compact, cost-effective, and high-performance solution
to overcome the limitations of existing LSFM systems, enabling biomedical researchers to visualize subcellular
dynamics in a high-throughput and noninvasive manner. To validate the effectiveness and applicability of our
system, we will demonstrate its performance through high-content molecular dynamic mapping of chimeric
antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cells and organelle profiling of zebrafish development. While the implementation of
our metasurface-integrated open-top LSFM is on LLSM, the metasurface design pipeline and integration protocol
can be readily adapted and extended to a wide range of existing LSFM systems. By combining the power of
LSFM with metasurfaces, our proposed technology will provide an accessible and high-performance solution for
high-resolution 4D imaging of physiological and pathological processes within live cells and organisms.

Sensorimotor learning and maintaining calibration of the motor system is essential for activities of daily living.
While the motor control literature has traditionally focused on a slow-learning, implicit process, recent work
highlights that rapid learning and readjustment of sensorimotor skills is supported by higher-order cognitive
strategies. The proposed research focuses on these cognitive strategies, and aims to understand their operation
during health and neurological disease. Based on our prior work, we propose that strategies may reflect two
broadly-classed mechanisms: an algorithm-like strategy that seeks to simulate the outcome of an intended action
before its execution and a retrieval-like mechanism that caches previously successful strategies in a short-term
memory store. We will ask whether these strategies can be improved over time, if people are sensitive to their
relative costs and constraints, and if they have differential impacts on the learning of an implicit system. All
studies will be conducted with neurologically-intact participants and individuals with spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA),
allowing us to assess the extent to which the cerebellum, which is known to play a critical role in sensorimotor
learning, supports strategy use. Importantly, we will determine if different kinds of strategies may form the basis
for viable, novel rehabilitation approaches for individuals with cerebellar damage or degeneration. These
strategies may represent an untapped or underappreciated resource for improving sensorimotor skill learning in
general, as well as a potential avenue for overcoming impairments associated with damage to the cerebellum
by exploiting extracerebellar circuits and resources not recruited by protocols that emphasize only implicit
sensorimotor learning. Alternatively, it may be that cerebellar damage also has a deleterious effect on an
individual’s ability to use cognitive strategies for sensorimotor control and learning, in line with recent findings
suggesting a prominent role for the cerebellum in cognition. In order to get to the heart of these issues, we will
systematically create conditions that require learners to adopt either an algorithmic or a retrieval-based strategy
to improve performance in a sensorimotor learning task. In addition to providing a more comprehensive account
of the nature of sensorimotor learning, the findings from the proposed work could also provide useful insights for
motor rehabilitation practices following cerebellar damage and degeneration.

Hippocampus is important for spatial memory. The prototypical neurophysiology is place cells一neurons that
are active at particular places in the environment (place fields). Collectively, place cells are thought to form
cognitive maps, an internal representation of the environment (i.e. spatial memory). Mechanistic models have
made predictions about the pattern of neural connectivity underlying cognitive maps. However, experimental
data of circuit structures are difficult to obtain, because neuronal arbors with synapses at nanometer scale are
densely packed in neuropils that span a millimeter or more in extent even for local circuits. Volume electron
microscopy is currently the only approach that can densely map neural connectivity at synaptic resolution
(connectomics). I have been trained in high-throughput transmission electron microscopy (TEM) techniques in
PhD, and more recently, I have developed an imaging pipeline with four current fastest TEMs. I will use
serial-section TEM imaging followed by circuit reconstruction to map local connectivity in hippocampus.
Furthermore, I will combine two-photon calcium imaging of neural activity during spatial navigation and EM
reconstruction on the same neurons (functional connectomics), to relate place fields of neurons to the
underlying neural circuits in the hippocampus. The goal is to experimentally test long-standing predictions on
patterns of neural connectivity by theoretical models: place cells with neighboring place fields are preferentially
connected with each other. Towards these goals, in my postdoctoral training I will develop methods to register
functionally imaged cells to the same cells in EM-reconstructed volume in the hippocampus and be exposed to
deep learning EM reconstruction approach. The training will take place in Princeton Neuroscience Institute,
under the guidance of Drs. David Tank and Sebastian Seung. With these skills, my goal is to develop an
independent research program of applying functional connectomic methods to relate circuit structure and
function in the hippocampus.

network of protein filaments, the most important being actin and microtubules (MTs). MTs are essential for
defining cellular shape and structure, as well as trafficking membrane-bound vesicles, organelles, and, during
cell division, chromosomes. To perform these functions, the cell must tightly regulate the formation of new MTs
via the process of MT nucleation. Cells primarily regulate MT nucleation by controlling the universal MT nucleator,
the γ-tubulin ring complex (γ-TuRC). To initiate MT nucleation, γ-TuRC is recruited to specialized regions known
as MT organizing centers (MTOCs), where γ-TuRC is activated and spatially oriented so that the resulting MT
has the appropriate polarity. Many of the first discovered MTOCs are also the most complex, including the basal
body, which generates flagellar MTs, and the centrosome, which generates many spindle MTs. These classical
MTOCs are composed of up to hundreds of unique proteins organized into complicated large-scale structures.
This makes them poorly suited to uncover MTOC function: namely, how MTOCs recruit, orient, and activate
γ-TuRC. To will illuminate these three basic principles by investigating γ-TuRC regulation in two model essential,
yet simple MTOCs: in the K99 phase, the vertebrate MT branch site and, in the R00 phase, the nuclear plaque
of model excavate Trypanosoma brucei. I will use a combination of reconstitution experiments and cryo-electron
tomography to uncover how these divergent, model MTOCs use shared principles to regulate γ-TuRC. My results
will both help the research community understand MTOC function, as well as provide new therapeutic avenues
to treat infection by parasitic excavates, an emerging global health threat.
 As proposed, this research plan will allow me to successfully pivot from my postdoctoral work with Dr. Petry,
an expert on vertebrate MT nucleation, to establish my own, independent research focus on excavate MT
nucleation and launch as an independent investigator. In addition, I have established a mentor team for the K99
phase of the proposal to train me in key technical areas that I require for the independent R00 phase. First, I will
master a TIRF-based assay pioneered in Dr. Petry’s lab that allows visualization of microtubule nucleation at the
single molecule level. Second, which I will learn cryo-electron tomography, a key technique of my proposal, in
collaboration with world experts Dr. Andreas Hoenger and Dr. Martin Beck. In learning this technique, I will
benefit from my mentorship team of Dr. Petry, Dr. Hoenger, Dr. Beck, and the cutting-edge vibrant structural
biology community at Princeton as a whole. Finally, I have recruited Dr. Chris de Graffenried, an expert in
excavate biology, to serve as a scientific mentor as I transition into this new model system. Through the training
phase of the proposal and beyond, I will learn from my mentor team how to successfully lead a research group
that fearlessly leverages a broad range of techniques and disciplines to answer critical scientific questions, and
will, in the R00 phase, establish this group at a leading U.S. institution.

Eating and drinking are rapid processes, but their postingestive effects are slow and delayed. How do animals
correctly associate these delayed effects (detection of nutrients or toxins in the gut) with transient stimuli like
tastes and smells that precede them by minutes or hours? To gain insight into this question, I leveraged the
fact that mice learn to associate novel, but not familiar, foods with gastric malaise signals to investigate what
distinguishes the neural representations of flavors that promote learning versus those that do not. I surveyed
brainwide expression of the immediate early gene Fos during drinking and during postingestive malaise and
discovered that distinct functional networks of flavor-selective brain regions are recruited at different phases of
postingestive learning. This led to two key hypotheses about how the brain is able to link tastes and flavors to
delayed postingestive feedback. During the postdoctoral phase (K99/Aim 1) of this proposal, I will test the
hypothesis that an amygdala network centered on the central amygdala (CEA) represents novel flavors during
drinking and that this representation is then reactivated when postingestive feedback signals from the gut
arrive, providing temporal overlap between the flavor representation and feedback that promotes learning. I will
first use high-density Neuropixels recordings to demonstrate that CEA novel flavor representations are
reactivated during postingestive malaise (Aim 1.1) and then use optogenetic activation of CEA novel flavor
ensembles to show that these postingestive reactivations are sufficient to drive learning (Aim 1.2). In the
independent phase (R00/Aim 2), I will test the hypothesis that a limbic network centered on the lateral septum
(LS) blocks these novel flavor reactivations to gate the formation of postingestive associations when flavors are
recognized as familiar and safe. I will first use axon terminal photostimulation to identify the specific LS
projection that gates learning (Aim 2.1) and then combine this manipulation with high-density neural recordings
in downstream regions (Aim 2.2) and brainwide Fos imaging (Aim 2.3) to investigate how LS activity blocks the
formation and reactivation of novel flavor representations. These experiments will generate key insights into
the cross-region neural mechanisms that support conditioned taste aversion and postingestive learning. During
the K99 phase, I will gain crucial technical expertise — in Neuropixels electrophysiology, advanced
computational tools, and activity-dependent genetic labeling — and professional development that will be
essential for my independent lab’s mission. Our ultimate goal will be to uncover general principles by which
interoceptive signals engage the brain to control behavior and how the mechanisms underlying postingestive
learning go awry in eating disorders and obesity.

This project will elucidate the psychological processes that give rise to gender disparities in mental health
across development. Despite efforts toward mitigating such disparities, gender-linked outcomes remain stark:
relative to men, women consistently report higher rates of internalizing problems and lower levels of self-
esteem. The relation between gender and mental health is evident by adolescence: thus, efforts to identify how
such disparities emerge—and, critically, how they may be mitigated—require a broad-based investigation into
the psychological processes that create and sustain them across development. To date, research into the
emergence and manifestation of gender differences in mental health has focused largely on the role of
biological factors linked to sex (e.g., differences in genetics, brain circuitry, or hormones). However, gender
identity—the extent to which one identifies as a boy/man, a girl/woman, nonbinary, or another gender—is
complex and multi-faceted. Not only is its relation to biology inconsistent, as in the case of gender-diverse
populations, but it is linked to a host of psychological variables (e.g., attributes, behaviors, and experiences)
that may themselves contribute to psychological distress. The proposed research will seek to achieve a more
holistic understanding of how gender disparities in mental health emerge by involving a diverse sample of
adolescents, including cisgender girls (gender identity: girl, assigned sex: female), transgender girls (gender
identity: girl, assigned sex: male), cisgender boys (gender identity: boy, assigned sex: male), and transgender
boys (gender identity: boy, assigned sex: female). This sample will be drawn from a large-scale longitudinal
study of socially-transitioned transgender and gender-diverse youth in North America (including 40+ U.S.
states), of which the project Sponsor is the Principal Investigator. Our research will seek to address several
important objectives across two waves of online data collection, spaced one year apart.
In Aim 1, we will distill the unique role of gender identity, relative to assigned sex, in predicting gender
disparities in mental health across adolescence. In Aim 2, we will elucidate the influence of relevant
psychological variables linked to gender (i.e., possession of feminine vs. masculine characteristics, reports of
self-objectification, and experiences of sexism) in accounting for gender disparities in mental health across
adolescence. By investigating gender disparities in mental health in a sample comprised of both cisgender and
gender-diverse adolescents, this research is well-positioned to clarify the role of gender-linked psychological
variables—relative to biological ones—in predicting gender disparities in mental health, thus opening up novel
pathways for achieving gender equity in this domain. Additionally, the proposed project enables us to expand
the inclusivity of research on mental health by affording us the opportunity to examine gender-based disparities
in mental health in the context of existing disparities between cisgender and gender-diverse adolescents.

Sanfilippo disease (mucopolysaccharidosis type III; MPS III) is a devastating neurodegenerative lysosomal
storage disorder of childhood whose pathologic features are neurologic: slowing of development, severe
behavioral problems, progressive cognitive decline, dementia, and decline in motor skills leading to immobility,
unresponsiveness, and death. We have focused on MPS IIID caused by a deficiency of alpha-N-
acetylglucosamine-6-sulfatase (GNS). Because MPS IIID is rare (1 in a million) and affects the brain (which is
difficult to treat) no cure or treatment is available and there are at least five patients in the USA to our knowledge.
Sanfilippo patient organizations have 19 additional cases registered around the world (see letter of support). Dr.
Patricia Dickson and Dr. Tsui-Fen Chou (LABioMed) have developed an enzyme replacement treatment (ERT)
for MPS IIID. Our strategy proposes to deliver recombinant human alpha-N-acetylglucosamine-6-sulfatase
(rhGNS) via intracerebroventricular infusion to effectively treat the underlying causes of the neurologic symptoms
that dominate MPS III pathology. ERTs can have a dramatic effect on the quality of life and patient development
especially when administered early in developments. There are several examples of successfully
commercialized ERT’s (e.g. laronidase (MPS I), idursulfase (MPS II), etc.) and BioMarin recently received
approval for an ERT for a form of Batten disease, CLN2. Other ERTs for MPS I, II, and IIIB are in Phase I trials.
Both the FDA and investors are familiar with ERT and its commercialization path, which will greatly increase the
chances of reaching a clinical trial. LABioMed has filed a US patent on rhGNS and Phoenix Nest, Inc. has
licensed it. Our pivotal nonclinical and manufacturing plans are on track.
We had a positive interaction with the FDA and got guidance for moving our program into the clinics. In
preparation for the interventional study the recommendation was for a thorough natural history study (NHS) in
the available patient population with a broad net to capture endpoints that are most likely to predict the clinical
benefits in each individual. Since the number of diagnosed patients is small the collected data form each
individual would be their own control at the time of intervention, where the patient will receive the recombinant
enzyme. Most of the work will be executed by contracted service providers. The clinical trial itself will be
conducted at NYU under the guidance of Dr. Lau. She has experience with over 10 clinical trials interventional
and observational. The clinical protocol was designed by the team at Phoenix Nest with help of KOLs and clinical
experts in the MPS III field. We have engaged expert third party clinical service providers to help with the
execution, monitoring and data collection. Crucial data collected from the patients on this study will help us
develop clinical outcomes that will be tools for measuring the efficacy of our rhGNS therapy and will be primary
endpoints on the pivotal study. The success on this trial will put a step closer to executing the pivotal trial to
assess the efficacy of our experimental therapy and its commercialization.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
Protein biologics constitute an important class of therapeutics owing to their high specificity, bioactivity and
potential for tunability. Cytokine (CK) proteins applied as biotherapeutics show great promise for several disease
indications, including cancer, multiple sclerosis, and hepatitis C infection. However, major barriers preventing
the advancement and widespread clinical use of CKs to address critical public health needs include: (I)
tendencies to cause systemic immune activation as a result of their on-target, off-tumor effects (ii) rapid
proteolytic degradation and clearance by the kidneys as small proteins (<20 KDa) with short half-lives in
circulation and (iii) frequent and high dosing leading to undesirable “peak-and-valley” pharmacokinetic (PK)
profile which result in (iv) reduced therapeutic efficacy, dose-limiting toxicities and reduce patient compliance.
New strategies are urgently needed for simultaneously targeting tumor antigens to build specificity and
localization while also tuning half-life. A multi-functionalized CK with tunable properties could lead to the next
generation of clinical biologics. Existing approaches to extend half-life such as the attachment of polyethylene
glycol moieties (PEG), tend to elicit undesired immunogenicity and new tools are required solve this defining
challenge. Pearl Bio’s proprietary synthetic biology platform technology is built on three core technologies:
Genomically Recoded Organisms (GROs), engineered orthogonal translation systems (OTS), and tethered
ribosomes for production of novel proteins incorporating synthetic amino acids (sAAs) including novel sAAs
previously inaccessible for precise functionalization. In proposed studies, we will leverage this platform to
demonstrate the tunability of CK half-life as well as tumor-targeting through precise and multi-site incorporation
and functionalization of sAAs with fatty acid groups. Specifically, we will (1) Demonstrate multisite incorporation
of sAAs into IL-15, (2a) Perform efficient lipidation and purification of synthetic IL-15 biologics with fatty acid for
tuning half-life, (2b) Enable tumor-targeting functionalization using engineered antibody/nanobody (multiple
instances if desired) and (3) Measure immunogenicity, bioactivity and albumin/tumor-antigen binding of these
IL-15 variants in vitro. In summary, during Phase 1 we will develop multi-site fatty acid functionalization of
cytokines and perform in vitro testing for bioactivity and immunogenicity. In Phase 2 studies, albumin and tumor
targeting capabilities would be combined to create a multi-functionalized CK with tunable half-life and tumor
specificity. Phase 2 in vivo studies will be used to test half-life tuning, tumor homing and efficacy of the multi-
functionalized CKs for further therapeutic development. We envision that this project could establish the basis
for entirely novel and programmable protein biologics with utility across a broad range of disease indications.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：ABSTRACT
Hundreds of thousands of children (669,799) were confirmed victims of maltreatment in the United States in
2017. In that same year, 34% of the 442,733 children in foster care had been in more than one placement and
11% were in a group home or institution. Out-of-home placement decisions have extremely high stakes for the
present and future well-being of these children because some placement types, and multiple placements, are
associated with poor outcomes. But which children require --and, more importantly, would benefit-- from a
placement in residential care? Decision-making support tools currently used by states to recommend specific
level-of-care (LOC) placements for children do not maximize the rich data and innovative methodological
approaches that are being explored in other fields like medicine. In addition, structured decision making (SDM)
has been used to guide decisions about risk in child welfare settings but, in comparison to predictive modelling,
SDM is limited by the use of a smaller group of factors to make recommendations. Outcome Referrals, Inc. has
employed sophisticated machine learning techniques over the past 10 years to risk-adjust behavioral health
outcome data for clients using their current characteristics. We have evidence of the predictive validity of this
approach for generating risk-adjusted scores via the PCORI-funded RCT in which clients were matched with
clinicians who had previous clients who did well in treatment. With the assistance of NIH SBIR funding, we
plan to improve the success rates of children in the child welfare system with an innovative, scientifically-
derived tool called “Placement Success Predictor” to guide level-of-care decision-making. This product will use
machine learning algorithms to predict individualized outcomes for children and adolescents in a particular
placement type. During the Phase I project, we developed and validated machine learning models to predict
the probability of each youth’s success within placement types and conducted usability testing of a prototype to
assess potential barriers to implementation. The likelihood of success recommendations provided by the
machine learning models developed for the “Placement Success Predictor” clinical decision-making support
tool were associated with improved youth well-being (i.e., those children that were placed in the Placement
Success Predictor-recommended placement had four times higher success rates). Potential future users found
the prototype of this tool easy to use. The machine learning models appear to distinguish clients who will do
well in various placement types and suggest that only 10% of clients would be successful in higher-cost level of
care. With the Family First Prevention Act, states are now required to pay the average $88,000 per year to
keep a child in residential care if that high level of care is not authorized. We submit this tool could help
improve overall outcomes and reduce healthcare costs when and if high-cost residential care options are
judiciously provided to children who are most likely to benefit from them. In Phase II we propose to develop this
flexible program to generate placement recommendations per client based on automatically updated custom,
site-specific machine learning prediction models then assess its efficacy and effectiveness.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
This program is focused on developing a disease-modifying drug for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) by advancing our
lead compound into clinical development. There are no disease-modifying small molecule drugs for AD, and the
prevalence of AD is increasing worldwide. This program is progressing to fill this need with a disease modifying
drug that, if successful, will have a tremendous impact on the more than 6.7 million Americans who currently
have AD (projected to be 13.8 million by 2060) and their caregivers, and will help reduce the current cost of $345
billion (projected to be $1.1 trillion by 2050) to our nation (Alzheimer's Association 2023 Alzheimer's Disease
Facts and Figures). Key requirements for treating early-stage AD include safe, efficacious, and cost-effective
therapeutic interventions. This small molecule, CNS drug-like lead significantly fulfills these requirements based
on our preliminary results. This highly differentiated tau self-association inhibitor targets tau self-association at
the beginning of the tau aggregation cascade. Small molecules were screened and optimized using in vitro
assays to select molecules that inhibit the formation of tau oligomers from tau monomers. In vitro pharmacology
studies and pharmacokinetic (PK) studies in mice were used to select a lead compound for evaluation of in vivo
efficacy. Preventive and therapeutic studies in two mouse models of tauopathy, representing tau aggregation in
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and four-repeat-tau tauopathies, demonstrated proof-of-concept and supported the
selection of this compound for further development. Methods development and manufacture of 1.61 kg of the
lead compound was completed for non-clinical safety studies. GMP manufacture of a 2.8 kg batch of drug
substance for initial clinical studies was completed, and pre-formulation studies for development of drug product
were completed. The IND was submitted (June 1, 2022) for first in human (FIH) studies that initiated in early
2023. The awarded Phase 1a study is a double-blind, randomized, three-part study designed to evaluate the
safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of the tau self-association inhibitor, in single ascending doses, multiple
ascending doses, and single doses in healthy elderly. This Supplement is to cover unanticipated incremental
costs related to project delays directly attributable to FDA requests for additional toxicology data on the
compound prior to progressing to higher doses in human volunteers. The Aims of this one-year supplement are
as follows: Aim 1. GMP Manufacture of additional batches of capsules, at two different strengths, using
established process and formulation to provide additional clinical supplies. It is urgent that these activities be
supported and started as soon as possible as currently available clinical supplies will reach their expiry date prior
to the anticipated date of completion of clinical activities. Any delay in providing this support will result in a delay
to completing clinical activities for the studies supported by this grant.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Despite prevalent use of anti-platelet and anti-lipid therapies, stroke remains the third major cause of death
and is the leading cause of adult disability in the US with an estimated cost in the range of $34 billion
annually. Approximately 20% of the annual 795,000 stroke patients die within one year and 15-30% are
permanently disabled. Antiplatelet therapy is mainly used for primary prevention of acute ischemic stroke in
cerebrovascular disease. Bioactive fatty acids are a new class of molecular targets that hold great
therapeutic potential because of their diverse role as signaling molecules that regulate metabolism and
inflammation. The oxidation of arachidonic acid by 12-LOX results in the production of a number of bioactive
lipids including the metabolite 12(S)-HETE. The lipid receptor GPR31, an orphan class A GPCR, is a 12(S)-
HETE receptor recently shown to be involved in inflammatory signaling. We recently discovered that GPR31
mediates 12(S)-HETE prothrombotic signaling in platelets and promotes glutamate-induced oxidative
toxicity in neuronal cells. Therefore, we propose that targeting GPR31 may provide a therapeutic path
towards development of a safe and effective antiplatelet therapy that is coupled with secondary
neuroprotective effects for mitigating against the acute neurologic sequela of stroke to provide a more
effective and safer alternative option or adjunct to fibrinolytic therapy. We have recently succeeded in
identifying the first effective GPR31 antagonist using our cell-penetrating, membrane-tethered, Pepducin
technology to be validated in these preclinical IND-enabling studies as an anti-platelet and anti-stroke
agent. We show here that this i3-loop derived GPR31 lipopeptide has potent antiplatelet activity and nearly
completely suppresses arterial thrombosis without an effect on hemostasis in mice. Preliminary data with
the GPR310 pepducin shows a highly significant reduction in stroke infarct area in mice similar to the
protective effect of Gpr31-deficiency. Furthermore, we provide evidence for a direct neuroprotective effect of
the GPR310 pepducin on HT22 neuronal cells subjected to glutamate mediated oxidative stress. The goal
of this Phase 2 STTR project is to develop the GPR310 pepducin as a collaborative effort between Oasis
Pharmaceuticals (Lexington, MA), Tufts Medical Center (Boston, MA) that would provide a robust IND data
package required to advance the initial commercial development of the first GPR31 inhibitor as a dual
antiplatelet, anti-stroke drug. This drug development program would establish the scientific merit of the
GPR31 target by accomplishing the major milestones at the end of 2 years of GLP safety/pharmacology
and efficacy in stroke models ± thrombolytic therapy to support a Phase I first-in-human clinical trial.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) still is the leading cause of death in the United States. The demand for novel
treatments lead to the recent discovery of proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin 9 (PCSK9), which promotes the
degradation of low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) to increase atherogenic lipoprotein LDL cholesterol (LDL-
C) levels. Many treatments targeting PCSK9 have been developed but have limited efficacy in lowing LDL-
C. This proposal fills the critical knowledge gap by challenging the underlying presumption that RXRα is essential
to regulate the transcription of PCSK9 in the liver of nonalcoholic fatty liver diseases (NAFLD) patients. RXRα is
the core nuclear receptor, which always is considered to constitutively forms heterodimerization with other
nuclear receptors. Our preliminary data showed that hepatic depletion of RXRα leads to hepatic lipid
accumulation and PCSK9 induction, which can be abolished by AAV8-mediated hepatic overexpression of RXRα.
Consistently, we observed the increased cholesterol and LDL-C in the plasma of RXRα hepatocyte-specific
knockout (hepKO) mice, and hepatic overexpression of RXRα can significantly reduce the plasma cholesterol
and LDL-C levels. These preliminary data bring two scientific questions needed to be determined in this proposal:
1) why RXRα deficiency has primary effects on the PPARα signaling pathway; 2) how RXRα regulates PCSK9
expression in the liver. To find answers, we focus on elucidating the effects of RXRα protein post-translational
modification (PTM) on managing the partnership with PPARα and regulating PCSK9. Recently, we identified a
previously unrecognized acetylation residue of RXRα, which controls the heterodimerization between RXRα and
PPARα. The inhibitory effects of RXRα constitutively acetylated mutant further indicate that acetylation of RXRα
is essential for preventing the induction of PCSK9 in the liver of RXRα hepKO mice. Our data are the first to
show that RXRα is acetylated by CBP, and TNFα, the inflammatory cytokine presented in the NALFD liver,
impairs the CBP-mediated acetylation of RXRα. Interestingly, we also observed the decreased acetylation of
RXRα in the liver of high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice and human NAFLD patients. These results suggest a central
hypothesis that RXRα acetylation is required for regulating the PPARα-mediated transcription of PCSK9 in the
liver, and impaired RXRα acetylation in the NAFLD liver results in the increased cholesterol and LDL-C. We will
test this hypothesis with the following two aims: Aim 1: Determine the molecular mechanism by which RXRα
regulates the transcription of PCSK9 in the liver; Aim 2: Determine if and the extent to which RXRα acetylation
is a resilience factor to prevent the induction of PCSK9 and cholesterol in the fatty liver. Successful completion
of studies proposed in this proposal will identify the mechanisms by which acetylated RXRα coordinates with
PPARα to regulate PCSK9 transcription and prevent obesity-promoted hypercholesterolemia. This identification
will allow for the development of new alternative strategies for attenuating PCSK9 induction in the NAFLD liver,
which will help mitigate CVD risk, an NIH's mission directive.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：ABSTRACT: The major goal of this proposal is to investigate the potential for teixobactin, our newly discovered
antibiotic, to treat respiratory infections. As reported in 2019 by the CDC, pneumonia caused by drug resistant
Streptococcus pneumoniae, as well as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), are considered
serious threats. In addition, respiratory bacterial co-infections with Covid-19 have recently been recognized as a
significant problem. Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis are two other respiratory pathogens
particularly problematic in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and are common causes of
community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP).
 The most remarkable, and unexpected property of teixobactin is the lack of any detectable resistance to
this compound. Teixobactin hits two related targets—lipid II, precursor of peptidoglycan and lipid III, precursor of
wall teichoic acid. These highly conserved targets are not mutable—they are not proteins and are not directly
coded by DNA. Since our discovery of teixobactin, we and others have failed to generate resistant mutants in
any species including S. aureus, Mycobacterium tuberculosis or Bacillus anthracis. Teixobactin is highly
efficacious in animal models of thigh, lung and blood infections. Animal infection models predict that the human
dose of teixobactin for acute skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI) will be very low (≤1 mg/kg/day), which
is advantageous, as a low dose may minimize side effects and reduce manufacturing costs.
 Teixobactin is in preclinical development as an intravenous (IV) drug for treating skin infections caused
by pathogens such as MRSA. A pre-Investigational New Drug (IND) meeting with FDA was held in December
2018 whereby the FDA generally agreed with our development plan. An IND submission for ABSSSI is planned
for 2022.
 In this project, Aim 1 will produce enough teixobactin for all the proposed studies. Aim 2 will conduct
efficacy and PK/PD studies in animal models of pneumonia. Aim 3 will test in vitro susceptibility, bactericidal
activity, post antibiotic effect (PAE) and resistance in recent clinical isolates from respiratory infections. Aim 4
will prepare and submit an IND application for intravenous treatment of a respiratory infection. Aim 5 will explore
alternative routes of TXB administration (inhalation and intramuscular delivery), which would be particularly
useful for outpatient treatment of respiratory and other infections. With successful completion of these projects,
we will have demonstrated the promise of teixobactin for treating drug resistant respiratory infections and
explored more convenient routes of TXB administration.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
NovaSterilis, Inc. intends to develop and commercialize its novel sterilization platform based on supercritical carbon
dioxide (scCO2) and powerful sterilant, NovaKill™ for the pharmaceutical market – NovaAPI™. Sterilization of drug
substances (or active pharmaceutical ingredients; APIs) and drug products is a challenging application due to the
complexities of many drugs and biologics and the minimal compatibility of current sterilization modalities (e.g., steam,
radiation, ethylene oxide). Sterilization in the pharmaceutical industry is typically reserved only for drug substances that
move onto final assembly (i.e., aseptic processing and packaging), which does not provide the level of protection of
sterilization. Products intended to be sterile should be terminally sterilized in their final container whenever possible
(referred to as terminal sterilization) according to the FDA. However, there are very few drug products that utilize terminal
sterilization, and with respect to drug products in sealed containers (e.g., lyophilized drugs or formulated drugs) or
prefilled syringes, the only option for drug companies is to use aseptic processing for final assembly of these products,
which is a time consuming and resource heavy process. While the global sterilization services market for drugs is significant
at roughly $6 billion USD, offering solutions to drug manufacturers for terminally sterilizing drug containing end products
would be a game changer. The global prefilled syringe market alone is estimated to be $5.4 billion USD by the end of 2021,
and currently, the only solution for final assembly of these products is through aseptic processing. This represents a
significant opportunity for the NovaSterilis NovaAPI™ solution, with the potential for enormous upside in providing safer
products, eliminating the need for aseptic processing for process-compatible products and expanding on the number and
type of drug substances/products that can be terminally sterilized.
Previous research results support continued development of the NovaSterilis platform for sterilization of drug substances
and products with the potential for developing a terminal sterilization process for final drug products in vial/syringe
format. We have partnered with a global leader in sterilization services for the broader program, which should provide
significant application, customer, and market insight to the project. iFyber has proposed the following Specific Aims in this
Fast Track proposal to prepare NovaAPI™ for commercialization:
Phase I Specific Aims:
 · Aim 1: Establish a drug substance compatibility matrix for a select number of drugs using NovaAPI™
 · Aim 2: Establish baseline conditions for terminal sterilization of end products
Phase II Specific Aims:
· Aim 3: Complete assessment of sterilization validation process for SAL 10-6 for drug substances/products.
· Aim 4: Complete sterilization residuals testing following regulatory guidelines.
· Aim 5: Establish scale up process parameters and load configuration in a 100L vessel.

 C. difficile now causes more hospital-onset infections and deaths in the US than any other pathogen and is
the most important cause of healthcare-associated diarrhea among adults in industrialized countries. In 2017,
there were an estimated 462,100 combined healthcare- and community-associated C. difficile infection cases in
the US, and 20,500 in-hospital deaths. In a randomized trial, soap and water washing for 30 seconds reduced
but did not eliminate hand contamination in patients with CDI or asymptomatic carriage of C. difficile, whereas
alcohol hand hygiene had no effect. The hands of healthcare workers frequently become contaminated with C.
difficile spores, but hand washing with soap and water has only modest efficacy, and alcohol-based hand
sanitizers have essentially no efficacy against spores. Thus, there is an important unmet need for development
of effective strategies to reduce the burden of spores on hands. Given the concern that unrecognized
asymptomatic carriers contribute significantly to transmission, there is an urgent need for comprehensive
approaches applicable to persons who directly care for CDI patients, and also more generally for all hand
hygiene.
 We have developed a practical and highly innovative approach to meet this need through the development
of a sporicidal hand wash that is effective in significantly reducing C. difficile spores on skin. Our hand wash
formulation is based on the use of a new class of microstructured fluid (MSF) made with microfibrillated cellulose
which significantly enhances the removal of C. difficile spores from skin by physical and mechanical means
compared to traditional soap and water. The shear stresses generated at the skin surface during washing with
MSF are 10 to 100 times higher when compared to what can be obtained with traditional soap and water.
Importantly, we have recently discovered that when the microstructured fluid is made with the inclusion of novel
and skin-safe sporicidal ingredients at neutral pH, we are able to achieve ∼3.5 log reduction of C. difficile spores
from porcine skin in 30 seconds according to comprehensive testing. This discovery constitutes a significant
improvement over conventional soap and water, and in principal, should result in high assurance prevention of
transmitting C. difficile infection. This new discovery is significant since current alcohol-based hand sanitizers
are ineffective against C. difficile spores. This project is focused on: 1) optimizing and finalizing the MSF hand
washing formulation based on testing with an established skin model with the goal of achieving >3 log reduction
of C. diff spores and important HAI infections from skin; 2) manufacturing the MSF hand wash product under
GMP, performing compatibility/stability studies and developing quality control requirements; and 3) testing the
safety and tolerability of the MSF hand wash on skin as required by FDA.

Sex differences in the development and prevalence of mental illnesses are widespread, suggesting that the
factors that promote disease risk and resilience may be distinct in men and women. The neurobiological
mechanisms underlying this possibility are poorly understood, however, because the vast majority of pre-
clinical animal research has been conducted in males. In addition, the behavioral outcome measures used to
understand learned fear have focused predominantly on passive, or freezing behavior. We recently identified
an active, escape-like conditioned fear response in rats (“darting”) that occurred almost exclusively in females
and was associated with an augmented response to the foot shock unconditioned stimulus. A better
understanding of potentially sexually dimorphic mechanisms that drive this behavior could open new avenues
for treatment of disorders that are more prevalent in women, like PTSD. We have collected preliminary data
implicating the neural projections from the anterior cingulate (ACC) to ventrolateral periaqueductal gray
(vlPAG) as a potentially novel, sex-dependent circuit that integrates sensory pain information into conditioned
and unconditioned fear responses. We propose here to explore sex differences in this circuit at both the
structural and functional level. First, we will use a retrograde tracer to perform a quantitative mapping of ACC-
vlPAG projections, then we will characterize the post-synaptic vlPAG targets of ACC afferents using trans-
synaptic viral approaches combined with fluorescent immunohistochemistry. Next, we will record ACC-vlPAG
activity during fear conditioning using fiber photometry to correlate activity to stimulus presentation and
behavioral responses, and finally test the causal role this circuit plays in driving darting using circuit-specific
chemogenetic techniques. Together, these studies can provide insight into sex-dependent circuit mechanisms
underlying individual differences in stress resilience and vulnerability.

Enzymes play a critical role in biological processes, and measurements of enzyme activity in cells and tissues
are foundational to our understanding of physiology and pathophysiology. Measuring enzyme activity in vivo
provides context within the intact living tissue, enabling organ- or organism-level understanding of the spatial
and temporal differences in enzyme activity. However, most research regarding enzyme activity has been lim-
ited to in vitro and ex vivo methods due to our inability to observe enzyme activity with high sensitivity and high
resolution in deep tissues. Fluorescence-based techniques offer a non-invasive, high resolution look at molec-
ular or morphological information but are often hampered by limited tissue penetration. Imaging in optical tis-
sue windows in the short-wave infrared (SWIR; 900-1700 nm) enables deeper tissue penetration and improved
resolution than visible or NIR light due to reduced absorption and scattering by biological materials. Even at
ideal wavelengths, photoluminescence imaging requires incident light to excite the fluorophore, resulting in
light attenuation both going in and out of the tissue. Luciferase-based bioluminescence imaging eliminates the
need for external excitation, thereby reducing the distance light must traverse through tissue as well as elimi-
nating autofluorescence. While bioluminescence is preferred for many in vivo imaging applications, there are
no reports of SWIR-emitting luciferases, limiting this approach to less preferred visible wavelengths or NIR
probes emitting < 750 nm. In this proposal, bioluminescence energy transfer (BRET) from luciferases to SWIR-
emitting semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) generate self-illuminating SWIR-emitting contrast agents. We pro-
pose the development of the first enzyme-sensing, SWIR-emitting, self-illuminating quantum dots
(QDs). Multiplexing reference and enzyme-cleavable probes for ratiometric in vivo imaging will calibrate the
enzyme activity to the local concentration of probes and is facilitated by our hyperspectral SWIR preclinical im-
ager. We will test our sensor by visualizing the activity of MMP-16, a cell-surface biomarker of liver disease
progression that is correlated with fibrosis, hepatitis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). To test our hypothe-
sis that dual probe imaging with self-illuminating, SWIR-emitting contrast agents will enable spatial and tem-
poral enzyme activity maps, we will design, characterize, and optimize the BRET probes in vitro. In parallel, we
will use tissue phantoms to compare the signal-to-noise ratios (S/N) and image resolution using BRET vs. pho-
toluminescence excitation mechanisms. Finally, we will demonstrate the functionality of our sensor in phan-
toms and in a mouse model of liver cirrhosis. Successful completion of this project would result in a sensor ca-
pable of reporting MMP-16 activity deep in the liver with high resolution and high sensitivity. Demonstrating this
new way to take non-invasive, high resolution images of enzyme activity in deep tissues will enable a wide ar-
ray of new studies into the role of enzymes in pathophysiology by the scientific community.

The overarching goal of this project is to improve the reproducibility of quantitative MRI (qMRI).
Secondary goals are to enhance its sensitivity and specificity, and to enable its utilization in clinical
routine imaging by reducing the scan time. Successful completion of this project will help towards the
fulfillment of qMRI's promise to objectify the radiologists' analysis and to improve the comparability of
different scans, which is much needed in the age of large multi-center studies, artificial intelligence, and
precision medicine.
It is well-known that estimates of spin relaxation times for biological tissue vary substantially throughout
the literature, in particular if different pulse sequences are used for their measurement. Our central
hypothesis is that this variability is a result of model oversimplifications, as un-modeled effects bias the
parameter estimates and this bias depends on the sequence. Simple models are commonly chosen for
in vivo qMRI to keep the scan time clinically feasible. This project aims to overcome this variability by
removing the most severe model oversimplifications, and we will enable an efficient encoding of the
more complex model with the "hybrid state," a spin-ensemble state whose discovery we recently
reported in Nature Communications Physics. Our preliminary data suggests that the hybrid state allows
us to disentangle different T1-relaxation paths, on a voxel-by-voxel basis and within a clinically feasible
scan time, and we find that magnetization transfer plays a dominant role in T1-relaxation in brain white
matter.
The three specific aims concern the physics, bio-medical, and the engineering aspects of the project
and will jointly establish the proposed model and hybrid-state pulse sequence for robust and fast
quantitative MRI. We aim to provide an improved understanding of multi-component T1-relaxation in
biological tissue and the clinical implications thereof, as well as to develop tools for quantifying the
developed biomarkers in a clinical imaging setting.
While this work is relevant to the entire field of biomedical MR, the project focuses on neuroimaging,
where the relevant biophysics in best understood; and we will use multiple sclerosis as a test-vehicle
for our model and pulse sequence, as the bio-medical interpretation of the physical parameters is well
understood.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
Although the neuromodulators dopamine (DA) and acetylcholine (ACh) are extensively implicated in the
pathogenesis and treatment of neuropsychiatric diseases, their effects on the activity of brain circuits are typically
studied separately, leaving their ability to dynamically cooperate in supporting brain function and dysfunction
incompletely understood. This is a significant limitation as (1) neuropsychiatric disorders typically involve
disturbances in multiple modulators, (2) existing therapies rarely target a single modulatory system, and (3) the
physiological actions of modulators are fundamentally inter-dependent, since many co-exist in individual brain
regions and converge on overlapping cells to stimulate receptors that complement, antagonize, or synergize with
one another. An influential hypothesis in the field of basal ganglia research is that ACh gates or modifies the
physiological actions of DA in the striatum – a subcortical forebrain region important for learning and motivating
goal-directed behaviors. However, we still lack a clear understanding of precisely when, how and over what time
course ACh interacts with DA to differentially affect striatal activity and behavior. We recently discovered that
ACh levels in the striatum of mice constantly undergo large, subsecond fluctuations that are temporally
coordinated with DA and modulated in amplitude depending on behavioral state. The main goal of this proposal
is therefore to build of this observation and to test the hypothesis that DA acts in concert with ACh, such that the
precise timing and amplitude of subsecond ACh transients relative to DA is key for deciphering the effects of DA
on striatal circuits and behavior. We will do so by first monitoring the dynamics of DA and ACh with subsecond
precision from the striatum of mice engaged in reward-based behaviors using dual-color photometry of red and
green DA and ACh sensors (Aim 1). Next, we will mechanistically dissect the functional impact of ACh on DA
release and on striatal activity using photometric imaging combined with genetic and pharmacological
manipulations (Aim 2). Lastly, we will establish that ACh transients can gate the effects of DA on motivation and
learning using calibrated optogenetic manipulations (Aim 3). Together, the proposed work will provide crucial
mechanistic insights into the structure and function of coordinated DA and ACh dynamics in the striatum of mice
and pave the way for future investigations into how the disruption or potentiation of such coordination in humans
contributes to the development or treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Project summary: Ants are social insects that live in colonies of morphologically and physiologically different
individuals that are essentially identical genetically, making ants an attractive system to study epigenetic
phenomena. Ant colonies contain many workers that perform most tasks but do not lay eggs, while queens are
solely responsible for reproduction. Remarkably, queens live up to 10X longer than workers, in sharp contrast
with most animals in which high reproduction leads to shortened lifespan. The jumping ant Harpegnathos
saltator exhibits a high degree of aging plasticity: In the absence of the queen, some workers can become
pseudo-queens called gamergates. Gamergates dramatically change their behavior, produce eggs, reconfigure
their brain and most dramatically, have a 5X lifespan extension. Remarkably, when placed in the presence of a
genuine queen, gamergates transition back into workers with an accompanying shortened lifespan. We
established Harpegnathos as a model system that can be manipulated with CRISPR/Cas9, providing a unique
opportunity to study the molecular mechanisms that control aging, as well as the crosstalk between aging and
reproduction.
 Using a combination of transcriptomics as well as both ex vivo and in vivo pharmacological manipulations, we
discovered that gamergates have an elevated production of Insulin accompanied by differential regulation of the
two branches of the Insulin signaling pathway (IIS) in target tissues. The MAPK branch of IIS is activated in the
gamergate fat body and ovary, while the AKT branch is repressed by extracellular “anti-Insulin” proteins, ImpL2.
As MAPK activity is required for egg-laying, we hypothesize that repression of the AKT branch contributes to the
dramatically extended longevity in gamergates.
 We now propose to investigate the molecular mechanism of ImpL2 function and test its role in aging. First,
we will identify the source and organismal distribution of ImpL2, and then experimentally modulate its levels and
mutate ImpL2 to examine the effect(s) on IIS and increased metabolism for egg formation. Furthermore, we will
explore the molecular interactions of ImpL2 and the mechanisms that lead to the specific inhibition of the AKT
(but not MAPK) IIS pathway. Next, we will test the effect of ImpL2 on aging in manipulated animals, assessing a
panel of aging biomarkers and extend our investigations to another anti-Insulin protein, ALS. Moreover, tissue-
specific manipulation of ImpL2 expression in Drosophila will address its potentially conserved effect on
reproduction and lifespan in a powerful model system. Finally, we will extend our study to the brain remodeling
events that accompany and orchestrate the social transition. We will perform single-cell mRNA sequencing of
the different social groups/ages to survey age-associated changes in the Harpegnathos brain and identify
candidate regulators responsible for delayed aging in gamergates. We will exploit the transcriptomic data to test
how specific genetic functions modulate brain circuits and aging.

Family caregivers of people with dementia have to decide between tube feeding and hand feeding when
persistent eating problems arise. This decision can be difficult for Chinese-American dementia caregivers, due
to the interplay of culture, potential absence of a patient’s advance directive, poor understanding of dementia,
and lack of knowledge on the risks and benefits of tube feeding. There is a high prevalence of tube feeding
among Chinese older adults with advanced dementia; however, tube feeding does not have health benefits for
older adults with advanced dementia, and may in fact be related to increased risk and discomfort. Shared
decision-making is a process by which patients, family members, and healthcare providers work together to
create care plans that balance clinical evidence and patient preferences and values with risks and expected
outcomes. Current clinical discussions on feeding tubes rarely meet this standard. Limited research has been
conducted to improve decision quality regarding feeding options among Chinese-American dementia caregivers.
This pathway to Independence Award (K99/R00) will give Dr. Pei the training, mentoring, and skills necessary
to conduct intervention research to improve decision-making about feeding options for dementia patients in
Chinese American communities. The goal of this study is to develop and pilot test a culturally adapted decision
aid intervention to support Chinese American dementia caregivers in decision making about feeding options. To
become an independent investigator in improving end-of-life decision making, Dr. Pei will receive training and
mentoring in four areas: (1) deepening the knowledge of end-of-life decision-making, (2) gaining additional
training in qualitative methods research, (3) developing proficiency in clinical trial design and (4) enhancing
professional developmental skills in grant writing, research team management, and leadership. In the K99 phase,
the candidate proposes two aims. Aim 1: Conduct individual interviews with family caregivers and healthcare
professionals to inform the adaptation of an existing intervention; Aim 2: Develop, refine, and acceptability test
the culturally adapted decision aid. In the R00 phase, the candidate aims to refine and evaluate the efficacy of
the decision aid in a pilot randomized controlled trial among 60 Chinese American dementia caregivers (Aim 3).
By the end of the R00 award, Dr. Pei will complete the transition from observational and explanatory research to
behavioral intervention work and submit an R01 proposal. Her strong mentoring team, well-established
collaboration with community organizations in New York City, and ideal environment of research support and
resources at New York University will help Dr. Pei become a successful independent investigator in improving
end-of-life decision making for older adults with dementia.

Chronic widespread pain (CWP) is a chronic pain subtype that affects multiple body sites, and is strongly
associated with poor function and disability. Although CWP is highly prevalent in adults with obesity, CWP
outcomes are disproportionately worse in non-Hispanic Black (NH Black) and Hispanic/Latino/a/x adults. Thus,
the obesity-related health disparity in CWP could augment existing racial and ethnic pain disparities in these
populations. Bariatric surgery is often prescribed to treat obesity and musculoskeletal pain comorbidities.
However, there is significant variability in weight loss and pain trajectories after bariatric surgery. Moreover, many
patients experience recurrent or unresolved pain after bariatric surgery that can inhibit weight loss or facilitate
weight regain. There are critical gaps in our knowledge of the primary driver(s) of CWP outcomes and how
driver(s) of CWP respond to weight loss, particularly in racial and ethnically diverse groups. As such, the main
objective of the proposed mentored project for the Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development
Award (K23) is to fill these knowledge gaps by: 1) comprehensively characterizing pain at rest and movement-
evoked pain (MEP) in NH Black and Hispanic/Latino/a/x adults after bariatric surgery, and 2) identifying potential
key driver(s) of intra-group variability in the resolution or maintenance of pain after bariatric surgery. We will
focus on pain sensitivity, joint motion and mechanical loading biosignatures, and psychosocial factors. The aims
proposed in this K23 application feature highly innovative methods that synergize mechanism-based pain
phenotyping with obesity and health disparities research approaches. The methodologies employed represent a
substantive departure from static, self-reported pain assessment to the integration of rigorous assessment and
measurement multiple dimensions of pain at rest and MEP using precise quantification of nociceptive processing
and joint motion and loading biosignatures in ethnically diverse populations. For the K23, I have assembled a
strong interdisciplinary and multicultural cadre of highly successful clinical, basic, and translational scientists who
have a strong and demonstrable commitment to the successful implementation and completion of my career
development plan and research project milestones. The primary training goals that are the linchpin of my
research training and career development are: 1) developing expertise in the integration of weight loss and
lifestyle change evaluations with pain phenotyping data, 2) to develop and implement clinical trial designs that
identify and address pain disparities, and 3) to enhance training in advanced statistical methods to inform clinical
trial design to examine pain disparities. New York University (NYU) and the University of Florida are very strong
incubators of pain, obesity, and rehabilitation research. Furthermore, these institutions are robust research
environments that have the resources available to me to build on my previous training to foster independence in
research that is focused on improving pain management in racially and ethnically diverse adults with obesity.

The proposed K01 Mentored Research Scientist Development Award will provide the applicant with advanced
training and skills to launch an independent research program focused on developing and adapting culturally-
sensitive interventions to reduce disparities in the psychological burden of cancer among ethnic minority
cancer patients and survivors. This K01 proposal seeks to culturally-adapt and test the feasibility of a writing-
based intervention, expressive helping, and its efficacy on psychological well-being, quality of life (QoL), and
cancer-related fatigue (CRF) among Chinese American cancer survivors. Expressive helping integrates two
distinct areas of research showing that expressive writing (i.e., a writing intervention that facilitates emotional
disclosure) and helping others (e.g., support giving) improves psychological well-being among healthy and
clinical populations. In expressive helping, participants write about their cancer experiences, disclosing their
emotions and providing encouragement and guidance, with the knowledge that their narratives will be shared
with and used as a resource for other cancer survivors. Aim 1 of the study is to conduct a qualitative study to
culturally adapt the expressive helping intervention for Chinese American cancer survivors. 24 In-depth
interviews and 3 focus group discussions with Chinese American cancer survivors and key informants will
inform the adaptation of the expressive helping intervention by focusing on material development and
recruitment, implementation, and retention strategies. In Aim 2, a mixed methods randomized controlled trial of
expressive helping will be conducted to test the feasibility and preliminary efficacy on psychological well-being,
QoL, and CRF outcomes (N = 108). Participants will complete follow-up outcome questionnaires at 1-, 3-, and
6-month follow-ups. A subset of the participants (n = 20) will complete post-intervention qualitative interviews
to examine how writing may have influenced their psychosocial adjustment. The proposed study is well-suited
to the expertise the applicant brings to the project, and well-suited to be conducted in New York City (NYC), as
NYC has the largest Chinese population of any city outside of Asia. The K01 award will facilitate the applicant’s
transition from conducting basic research on culture and emotion regulation with healthy Asian Americans to
intervention research with minority cancer survivors. It will help build his long-term career goal in implementing
evidence-based interventions to reduce cancer health disparities in the psychological burden of cancer among
minority cancer survivors. As part of this award, the applicant will train in cancer survivorship, community-
based participatory research (CBPR), qualitative research, and mixed methods intervention research by
conducting the proposed study in collaboration with Drs. Chau Trinh-Shevrin (primary mentor), Qian Lu (co-
mentor), Jennifer Leng (co-mentor), Marjorie Kagawa-Singer (consultant), and Annette Stanton (consultant).

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
Animals can exhibit goal-directed behaviors in novel environments, despite limited experience
with them. How does the brain make and use inferences about the underlying statistics and
generative structure of environments to guide behavior? The field of reinforcement learning refers
to this capacity as “model-based” reasoning, meaning that it relies on an internal model of the
structure of the world. Critically, this internal model can be used to flexibly estimate the best
actions by mental simulation or planning, without direct experience. In contrast, in “model-free”
reinforcement learning, an agent chooses the best action based on direct experience, without
explicit knowledge of the underlying sequential transition structure of a task or environment.
 Model-based and model-free mechanisms coexist in the brain and are mediated by distinct
circuits, although the neural circuit mechanisms by which the brain arbitrates between these
decision systems remains unknown. Theoretical and behavioral studies suggest that human
brains use the system that yields value estimates with the lowest uncertainty. The lateral
orbitofrontal cortex (lOFC) is a compelling candidate to perform arbitration because while it is
implicated in model-based reasoning, for instance by enabling inferences about hidden task
states, it lies upstream of the dorsal striatum, which is critical for both model-based and model-
free decision making. Intriguingly, we have found that lOFC neurons project exclusively to the
dorsolateral striatum (DLS), a region critical for model-free behavior, and not the dorsomedial
striatum (DMS), which is critical for model-based behavior. We hypothesize that projection
specific neural circuits in lOFC arbitrate between these systems by suppressing the model-free
system.
 I will use state-of-the-art viral, electrophysiological, and computational methods to
determine whether DLS-projecting lOFC neurons mediate uncertainty-based arbitration between
decision-making systems (Aim 1) and characterize the underlying circuit logic that supports
arbitration (Aim 2). By optogenetically tagging DLS-projecting lOFC neurons I will selectively
characterize and perturb their activity while monitoring the behavioral strategy rats use in a task
with latent structure. To determine how arbitration is instantiated in the dorsal striatum I will
optogenetically activate OFC→DLS neurons while recording from different genetic cell types in
the striatum, in vivo and in vitro. We predict that OFC→DLS neurons enable model-based
behavior by activating inhibitory interneurons to suppress the DLS and the model-free system.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Project Summary: This study will address the need for motivational strategies to achieve therapeutic levels of
task-repetition in upper extremity rehabilitation post-stroke. To this end, we are investigating optimal strategies
for utilizing music to increase motor activity, improve affect and increase functional activity in brain areas
related to motor recovery post-stroke. While most empirical studies of music-based interventions utilize fixed
music-playing tasks in which participants play a specified music sequence, the clinical practice of music
therapy involves improvisation, allowing the music to be adjusted in the moment to reflect the emotional, social
and physical needs of participants. We have therefore designed a study to characterize the effect of
improvisation within music-based interventions for upper extremity rehabilitation. In Aim 1 we will characterize
the motor, affective and physiological correlates of music improvisation for adults with post-stroke hemiparesis.
We hypothesize that the increased improvisation will be associated with increased motor activity (measured by
accelerometry) and increased affect (measured by self-report surveys following each condition and
physiological arousal). In Aim 2 we will assess the neural mechanisms of music improvisation by using fMRI.
We hypothesize that increased affect and motor output will be supported by increased functional connectivity
between core reward, motivation and emotion-related subcortical regions and cortical motor and frontal areas.
These findings will lay the foundation for optimal musi-based interventions that capitalize on improvisation to
maximize motor recovery and minimize attrition rate.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Project Summary
 Dopamine is an important neuromodulator that mediates learning from previous outcomes (“retrospective”
learning) by encoding reward prediction errors — the difference between experienced and expected rewards.
However, recent work has suggested that dopamine might use the prefrontal cortex to encode more abstract
prediction errors, such as errors about the hidden state of a task or environment. The exact circuit mechanisms
underlying these abstract hidden-state prediction errors remains unclear. This proposal has two major goals.
First, I will characterize dopamine activity related to hidden-state inference in rats performing a task with partially
observable states. Second, I will identify the circuit mechanisms that generate dopamine state prediction errors
in this task. I will use computational modeling and state-of-the-art genetic and viral tools, including fiber
photometry to measure dopamine activity and projection-specific chemogenetic silencing of prefrontal cortex, to
address these goals. I will measure dopamine activity both at the level of cell-body calcium dynamics, as well as
at the level of axonal release, which can be dissociated. This proposal will describe the multi-regional neural
circuits that underlie the acquisition and maintenance of abstract representations of the environment. The results
will provide insight into the pathology and treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders, which are characterized by
disrupted reward processing.
 My co-sponsors at New York University (NYU), Dr. Christine Constantinople and Dr. Paul Glimcher, have
complimentary experience in behavioral and systems neuroscience experiments in rats, and computational
modeling of decision-making, respectively. The training I will receive will allow me to pursue truly integrative
research that involves the close interplay between experiments and theory. The strong, collaborative
environment at NYU makes it an ideal place for me to pursue these research goals. My training plan provides a
detailed strategy for acquiring the necessary skills from a team of co-mentors with extensive, proven expertise
in the relevant techniques. Technical training, as well as frequent data presentations, attendance of professional
courses, seminars, and conferences, and development of my writing and leadership skills will equip me to
complete the proposed research, and transition to a post-doctoral position in my field of interest.

Sensing and processing information through signaling cascades is an essential part of cellular life. A few
signaling cascades such as the MAP kinase and Hippo pathways are ubiquitous among eukaryotes yet
perform different functions across organisms. Although these pathways are well-studied, how they evolve to
take on new functions and adapt to new inputs remains poorly understood. The Mitotic Exit Network (MEN), a
Ras-like GTPase signaling cascade and yeast homolog of the Hippo pathway, provides a unique opportunity to
study this question. In the MEN, the same core signaling components operate in distinct manners under
different developmental trajectories. During yeast mitosis which occurs through an asymmetric cell division
called budding, the MEN is scaffolded onto the spindle pole bodies (SPB, the yeast equivalent of centrosomes)
and responds to spindle position through its GTPase Tem1. During meiosis, where budding is suppressed and
thus no need to sense spindle position, MEN signaling is no longer organized at the SPBs, and it is unclear
whether Tem1 is still required for MEN activation and what signal it may respond to. To understand the
adaptation of the MEN under distinct cellular contexts, this proposal will test the hypothesis that this adaptation
is enabled partially by different activation mechanisms of the MEN kinase Cdc15, the effector kinase of Tem1,
between mitosis and meiosis (Aim 1). In contrast to the drastic change in spatial organization of the MEN core
components between mitosis and meiosis, the effector protein of the MEN, the phosphatase Cdc14, remains
sequestered in the nucleolus prior to activation both in mitosis and meiosis. In fact, this nucleolar localization of
Cdc14 is conserved from yeast to human. Sequestration of Cdc14 in the nucleolus could function either 1) to
ensure tight inhibition of Cdc14’s phosphatase activity prior to activation or 2) to localize Cdc14 to
dephosphorylate specific substrates in the nucleolus. To uncover the selection pressure that maintains this
conserved nucleolar localization of Cdc14, this proposal will examine these two hypotheses by sequestering
Cdc14 elsewhere in the cell and characterize the consequences first in yeast and then in mammalian cells
(Aim 2). The experiments within both aims will be initiated during the K99 phase which also includes training of
the candidate on new experimental systems such as yeast meiosis and mammalian cells, as well as the
development and implementation of quantitative microscopy, proximity labeling and optogenetics. Furthermore,
the candidate has assembled an outstanding mentor team to both advise her scientifically to facilitate progress
of the project and prepare her for the transition to an independent investigator. Together, this proposal will
create a strong foundation for an independent research career in understanding the evolution/adaptation and
spatial organization of cellular signaling.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
Shortly after fertilization, a dramatic reprogramming of the genome and transcriptome occurs, enabling the
embryo to develop quickly and robustly. This is especially exemplified in the Drosophila embryo, which within a
two-hour period undergoes 13 mitotic cycles, cellularizes the blastoderm, patterns the body plan, and gets ready
for gastrulation. While the gene networks underlying these processes have been well studied, it is not clear how
they are collectively initiated, a process referred to as zygotic genome activation. Moreover, although it was
observed that DNA replication occurs before transcription, the mechanisms that control this timing are not known.
Previously, we demonstrated that a single factor, Zelda, acts globally to activate early-expressed genes. We
found that Zelda binding to CAGGTAG sites across the genome lowers nucleosome barriers at enhancers,
thereby facilitating the binding of other key transcription factors. Zelda and these other factors are present in
sub-nuclear “hubs” (discrete foci) that were seen to colocalize at enhancers. We aim to use high-resolution
microscopy to investigate the which structural features of Zelda mediate hub formation. In addition, we are
interested in the regulatory mechanisms that control the timing of transcription and DNA replication so that
conflicts between the two processes are avoided. We propose that Zelda plays a dual pioneering role: 1) to open
chromatin for the Origin Recognition Complex to load and subsequent formation of the Pre-replication Complex,
which occludes the transcriptional machinery until origins have fired, and 2) to open newly formed chromatin for
transcription to initiate. Our goal is to first define origins of replication in early embryos, and to characterize
Zelda's role in origin licensing and transcriptional initiation. Our studies will lend into how these two fundamental
processes of DNA replication and transcription are coordinated during genome activation.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：The overarching goal of my research program is to identify and characterize molecular mechanisms
responsible for stress-induced permeabilization of the mitochondrial inner membrane. In most eukaryotic
cells, mitochondria are the primary source of the energy that they provide in the form of ATP by
performing oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). OXPHOS is a two-step process. First, substrate
oxidation by the respiratory chain results in the generation of the electrical potential on the mitochondrial
inner membrane. This potential energy drives generation of ATP by the phosphorylation of ADP at the
ATP synthase complex. To prevent energy dissipation and ensure that OXPHOS is efficient mitochondrial
inner membrane permeability should be tightly controlled and maintained at low levels. Stress conditions
associated with dysregulation of calcium and ROS homeostasis can lead to an increase in mitochondrial
inner membrane permeability – a phenomenon known as Mitochondrial Permeability Transition (mPT).
mPT causes dissipation of the membrane potential and loss of mitochondrial ATP-generating capacity
leading to cell dysfunction and death. mPT is critically involved in a broad spectrum of diseases ranging
from heart attack to neurodegeneration. Prevention of mPT is highly protective against cell death and
tissue damage suggesting high therapeutics potential. However, molecular mechanisms of mPT are not
well understood, and this gap in knowledge prevents mPT from being a drug target. Over the past five
years, we demonstrated that mPT is a multifaceted phenomenon and depending on the disease type and
stress severity, it can occur through different pathways. The central goal of our research program is to
identify the link between specific molecular mechanisms of mPT and specific stress conditions. We have
already established several original animal and cell disease-relevant models causing different types of
mPT. In our approach, a variety of methods that measure the mPT and tissue damage at the organismal,
cellular and mitochondrial levels are coupled with a number of our original electrophysiological (patch-
clamp) assays that allow direct measurement of mPT at the level of mitochondrial membranes and give
us a unique opportunity to dissect and characterize its multiple identities and regulation. The results of
our study will provide a detailed understanding of one of the most critical events in cell death cascades
and will bring an essential framework for the development of therapeutically approaches that will
selectively target mPT.

Neuronal plasticity allows neurons to change the strength of their connections with each other and even to
make or break connections. Plasticity is a fundamental property of neurons that underlies numerous brain
functions such as learning and probably sleep, but it is also misregulated in diseases such as autism. Making
stable changes in neuronal connections requires transcription and translation and an activity-dependent gene
expression program is rapidly induced in response to neuronal activity. Many of the genes in this first wave of
gene expression encode transcription factors that then regulate additional genes that are more directly
involved in plasticity. Mutations in components of these activity-dependent programs have been associated
with human cognitive disorders and psychiatric diseases, showing the importance of this pathway.
We study plasticity in s-LNvs, the principal Drosophila circadian pacemaker neurons, which are ideal since
changes in the morphology of their projections are predictable and happen at defined times each day. Having
only 4 s-LNvs per brain hemisphere makes their projections easy to visualize, and we have the tools of
Drosophila genetics to alter gene expression or neuronal activity in s-LNvs, along with expression profiles. s-
LNv structural changes are driven by neuronal activity: their projections expand at dawn when s-LNvs are most
excitable, and retract around dusk when s-LNvs become hyperpolarized. s-LNvs use activity-dependent gene
expression to expand projections, ultimately activating Rac1 GTPase to regulate actin. We have identified a
second transcriptional program that is activated by neuronal hyperpolarization and/or neuronal inactivity. This
program opposes activity-dependent gene expression and leads to Rho1 GTPase activation to retract s-LNv
projections. Just like activity-dependent gene expression, the first step in hyperpolarization-dependent gene
expression is to transcribe a gene encoding a transcription factor – in this case Toy, a fly Pax6 orthologue.
In Goal 1, we propose to understand the molecular mechanism of hyperpolarization-dependent gene
expression in s-LNvs, and test if this program functions in mammals. We will also test if hyperpolarization-
dependent gene expression is important in sleep, which is associated with overall synaptic downscaling. In
Goal 2, we will study competition between the activity-dependent and hyperpolarization-dependent gene
expression programs that likely works both transcriptionally and post-transcriptionally to ensure one program
dominates. In Goal 3, we will develop a genomic-based approach to identify connections between neurons that
we predict will be broadly applicable, and also to give insights into how new connections are specified at the
molecular level. Overall, studying plasticity in s-LNvs should give a holistic view of plasticity that is broadly
relevant across neurobiology and could identify new disease risk loci.

Reducing stigma to ensure viral load (VL) suppression for women with serious mental illness (SMI) and HIV is a
global priority, including in Botswana, where the intersectional stigma of SMI, HIV and womanhood is
marginalizing in ways that impede adherence to both psychiatric medications and antiretroviral therapy (ART),
which can threaten VL suppression. We apply our novel ‘what matters most’ (WMM) approach to target
intersectional stigma faced by women with SMI and HIV in Botswana via a stigma-reduction intervention in the
high-risk transition period after discharge from an initial psychiatric hospitalization. WMM conceptualizes how
stigma is felt most acutely when people are unable to achieve ‘full personhood’ by participating in the activities
that ‘matter most’ in their local context. In prior research, we found the core value for ‘full womanhood’ in
Botswana is achieved by being the ‘foundation of the household’ and is threatened by perceived: 1)
incompetence in fulfilling the duties of a family caregiver associated with SMI and 2) promiscuity associated with
having HIV. In Botswana, family acceptance as a viable ‘family caregiver’ is also key to achieving ‘full status’ as
a woman. As such, the risks of being identified as having SMI and HIV (e.g., partner/family abandonment) can
deter psychiatric and ART treatment adherence. Promoting capabilities that ‘matter most’ for achieving ‘full
womanhood’ could enable longer-term stigma reduction after psychiatric discharge, when women are
reintegrating into their communities, and improve ART adherence and promote sustained VL suppression. Our
group-based WMM stigma intervention is co-led by a peer woman who has coped effectively with SMI and HIV
stigma. The WMM stigma intervention model was piloted among pregnant women with HIV in Botswana with
promising reductions in stigma and depressive symptoms up to 4-months postpartum. We now test whether a
WMM intervention tailored for women with SMI and HIV will reduce intersectional stigma and facilitate VL
suppression. We propose a two-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT; N=180) with a 4-month follow-up to
compare the effectiveness of 1) WMM-based intersectional stigma intervention delivered as clients transition
from psychiatric hospitalization to outpatient care (‘WMM Stigma Intervention;’ n=90); and 2) attention control
following a similar format to isolate the effects of the intervention (n=90). Because family are commonly involved
in the care of people with SMI and face severe stigma, we propose a parallel, group stigma intervention among
family members, as addressing familial stigma could facilitate treatment adherence. Finally, because
intersectional stigma is reinforced at systemic levels, we seek to empower women with SMI and HIV to influence
structural change by coleading policymaker workshops to reduce stigma among policymakers and spur
policymakers to address the unique needs of women with SMI and HIV via future policies.

 The long-term goal of our research is to develop first-in-class, protein-based inhibitors against
human bacterial pathogens by directly blocking efflux pumps. Drug resistant bacteria pose an
urgent global health challenge by reducing the effectiveness of antibiotics used to treat infections
in humans and animals. The broadest resistance mechanism against antibiotics are efflux pumps,
which transport drugs out of the cytoplasm and reduce toxicity to the organism. While it is known
that efflux pumps display broad specificity to structurally distinct compounds, the mechanisms of
polyspecific drug binding and ion-coupled transport remain unanswered questions in the field.
Given the promiscuity of efflux pump binding to structurally distinct drugs, it is also unclear
whether potent and selective efflux pump inhibitors can be designed to target specific classes of
efflux pumps. The specific goals of this project are to discover novel mechanisms of active
transport in drug resistant Staphylococcus aureus and to harness this knowledge to design
selective inhibitors toward efflux pumps. Our proposal is strongly motivated by our recent
discovery of antibody fragments (Fabs) that bind the Staphylococcus aureus efflux pump NorA
and successful determination of high-resolution cryoEM structures using the Fabs as fiduciaries.
The structures revealed that the Fabs insert a loop into the substrate binding pocket from the
extracellular side, which suggests a design path toward protein- and peptide-based inhibitors.
This interaction is facilitated by an electrostatic interaction between a positively charged arginine
on the Fab and two essential anionic residues within NorA. Building on these preliminary data,
we propose to carry out four Specific Aims. Aim 1 will develop a hybrid approach of cryo-electron
microscopy and NMR spectroscopy to comprehensively study the transport cycle of NorA. Aim 2
will seek to determine the molecular basis for polyspecific drug binding. Aim 3 will design and
characterize protein-based inhibitors that target the accessible, outward-open conformation of
NorA. Aim 4 will develop peptides that miniaturize the antibody loops observed in the binding
pocket of NorA. We have assembled an interdisciplinary team with expertise in structural biology,
protein engineering, microbiology, chemical synthesis, and computational chemistry to rapidly
answer fundamental questions about multidrug transport and inhibition of efflux pumps. All of the
approaches applied to NorA will be translatable to other transporter systems.

G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) are mediators of and
therapeutic targets for diverse disorders, including chronic pain. This proposal challenges the
dogmas that these receptors signal primarily from the plasma membrane and that cell surface
receptors are the optimal therapeutic targets. Completed studies revealed that GPCR endosomal
signaling controls pain and that endosomally-targeted antagonists provide more effective
analgesia than conventional drugs. The renewal application extends these concepts to
tropomyosin receptor kinase A (TrkA), a RTK for nerve growth factor (NGF). Although successful
for the treatment of pain, NGF monoclonal antibodies have not been approved due to adverse
outcomes of systemic antagonism. A deeper understanding of how NGF and TrkA signal pain is
required. Anatomical and electrophysiological studies with mouse and human nociceptors,
behavioral studies in mice, biophysical assays using recombinant proteins, model cells and
nociceptors, and nanoparticle-encapsulated antagonists will be used to study NGF pain. Aim 1
hypothesizes that neuropilin 1 (NRP1) is required for NGF-induced sensitization of nociceptors
and NGF-evoked nociception. Preliminary studies suggest that NRP1 and the scaffolding protein
GAIP/RGS19-interacting protein (GIPC1) are necessary for NGF-induced nociception. Co-
expression of TrkA, NRP1 and GIPC1 protein and mRNA in mouse and human nociceptors will
be studied. Inhibitors of NRP1 and GIPC1 will be used to ascertain their contributions to NGF-
induced sensitization of nociceptors and nociception. Aim 2 hypothesizes that NRP1 acts as an
NGF coreceptor and TrkA chaperone to enhance NGF signaling of pain in nociceptors.
Biophysical approaches will be used to study NGF association with NRP1, assembly of
TrkA/NRP1 heteromers, TrkA surface expression, and NGF signaling in subcellular
compartments of nociceptors. The role of GIPC1 as a scaffold for TrkA and NRP1 association will
be studied. Aim 3 hypothesizes that endocytosis and endosomal NGF/TrkA/NRP1 signaling in
nociceptors mediates sustained sensitization and nociception. The contribution of endocytosis to
NGF-induced nociception will be studied using inhibitors of endocytosis and NGF/TrkA/NRP1
antagonists encapsulated into nanoparticles designed to deliver cargo to endosomes of
nociceptors. NGF-induced endocytosis of TrkA/NRP1, compartmentalized signaling, nociceptor
sensitization and nociception will be studied. A deep understanding of TrkA trafficking-dependent
signaling will provide insights into the mechanisms and treatment of chronic pain, with implications
for other RTK-mediated pathologies (e.g., cancer).

Children with speech sound disorder show diminished intelligibility in spoken communication, with negative con-
sequences for both social-emotional and academic-occupational outcomes [1–4]. While most speech deviations
resolve by the late school-age years, between 2-5% of speakers exhibit residual speech sound disorder (RSSD)
that persists through adolescence or even adulthood [5–7]. Both affected children/families and speech-language
pathologists (SLPs) have highlighted the critical need for research to identify more effective forms of treatment for
children with RSSD. Our work in the previous funding cycle showed that individuals with RSSD benefit from treat-
ment incorporating technologically enhanced sensory feedback (visual-acoustic biofeedback, ultrasound biofeed-
back). However, real-world adoption of biofeedback treatment remains limited by equipment costs and lack of
access to providers with specialized training.
 For our next phase of research, we focus on developing methods to support wider implementation of
technology-enhanced treatment for RSSD. Specifically, we investigate the possibility that access to biofeedback
can be expanded through telepractice service delivery and the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-powered technol-
ogy to extend the services provided by SLPs. At the same time, we evaluate whether the efficacy of biofeedback
can be further enhanced by adopting a precision medicine approach in which a treatment method is selected
based on a learner’s individual profile of sensory strengths and weaknesses.
 In this proposal, we will conduct the first controlled comparison of biofeedback treatment delivered in person
versus via telepractice (Aim 1), testing our hypothesis that biofeedback intervention can be delivered remotely
without any unacceptable loss of efficacy. If successful, this study will greatly expand the reach of biofeedback by
making it easier for children with RSSD to connect with trained clinicians. In Aim 2, we will utilize technology de-
veloped in the previous funding cycle to assess whether the maintenance of gains achieved through biofeedback
treatment can be enhanced through AI-mediated home practice. Finally, Aim 3 will lay groundwork for a precision
medicine approach by testing whether relative response to ultrasound and visual-acoustic biofeedback can be
predicted from a learner’s profile of sensory response across auditory and somatosensory domains.
 While new technologies have the potential to revolutionize the development and delivery of interventions for
speech disorders, there is an ongoing need for well-designed research studies to bring these advances into
evidence-based clinical practice. This research will address the needs of children with RSSD and the clinicians
who treat them by providing a robust evidence base to guide clinical decision-making and user-friendly tools that
support implementation.

Social vocalizations and movement-generated sounds often provide pivotal knowledge about an animal’s
identity, location, or state, yet most studies of natural behavior fail to integrate acoustic information with
simultaneous recordings of high-dimensional neural activity and behavioral dynamics. This proposal will develop
novel experimental and computational methods to attribute vocal and non-vocal sounds to individuals in a
naturalistic, acoustically complex, multi-animal environment. By integrating this rich acoustic information with
simultaneous video and wireless neural recordings, we seek to predict auditory cortical responses to auditory
cues, as a function of social context and individual identity within the family. Aim 1 will develop new tools with
which to attribute vocal and non-vocal sounds to individual animals in a multi-animal setting (i.e., the “who said
what” problem). In Aim 1A, we will collect, curate, and publicly release a range of benchmark datasets containing
simultaneous camera and microphone array recordings of multi-animal interactions with ground truth labels of
sound sources. We will use these benchmarks to validate new models for sound localization. In Aim 1B, we will
develop and release deep learning models that localize sounds with calibrated confidence intervals, using
synchronized video measurements to enhance predictions. Aim 2 will use these tools to identify archetypal,
acoustically-driven social behaviors. We will establish a new experimental paradigm that permits months-long
monitoring of rodent social behavior in a large, naturalistic environment with simultaneous camera and
microphone array recordings. Using this data, we will develop novel data analytic approaches that leverage
synchronized audio and video data streams to identify social interaction sequences. A key goal is to assess
individual differences in social behavior across families. Aim 3 is a proof-of-concept experiment in which we
determine how acoustically-driven social behaviors (established in Aim 2) predict auditory cortex responses to
both vocal or movement-generated sounds. To accomplish this, we will make continuous wireless
electrophysiological recordings from the auditory cortex of adolescent and adult gerbils within their naturalistic
family environment. We will build regression models to infer our ability to predict neural responses from
auditory/behavioral covariates (encoding models).

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is the most common inflammatory joint disease caused by a chronic inflammation in
joints, where no effective treatment is currently available. Currently there is no effective model can accurately
dissect RA pathogenesis and consistently predict the effect of a therapeutic agent in patients. Better model
systems that can accurately recapitulate the immune responses and pathological processes of RA in the
human synovial microenvironment with immunomodulatory treatments are critically required. In this work we
aim to develop a fully patient-derived in vitro RA disease model termed “Synovium-on-a-Chip” by including full
spectrum of synovial cell types, which can serve as a precision medicine platform to (1) interrogate human RA
pathobiology and to (2) achieve "clinical trial on chips" for stratifying patients and pre-screening of novel
immunotherapy. Simulating the structure and inflammatory microenvironment of the synovium with such a
biomimetic vascularized immunocompetent microphysiological system will represent a major advance over
existing models, providing much greater biomimicry and enabling next-step studies to allow rational selection
of immunomodulatory drugs to personalize treatment of RA patients.

Allostatic load, which is characterized by the dysregulation of physiological activity across multiple systems in
the body, has been linked to an increased risk of chronic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, and stroke.
However, the prevalence of allostatic load is not equally distributed among US subgroups, with Black adults
having higher allostatic load than White adults, particularly during middle and older age. The reasons for these
disparities are not fully understood, despite research into factors such as stressors, diet, and socioeconomic
position. Discrimination has been identified as a risk factor for allostatic load. While discrimination is
understood as a multidimensional construct that operates at multiple levels and in different social contexts, the
association between multiple forms of discrimination and allostatic load remains understudied, as well as the
underlying mechanisms by which discrimination may affect physiological function. The cellular-level processes
through which discrimination "gets under the skin" and leads to physiological dysregulation remain unclear.
This study aims to define the relationship between multiple forms of discrimination and allostatic load using
data from three large, population-based cohort studies, in order to increase the efficacy of prevention efforts
and treatment to reduce allostatic load and Black-White disparities in allostatic load. By assessing the
associations between multiple forms of discrimination (neighborhood and interpersonal) with allostatic load, the
study will quantify the extent to which discrimination explains racial disparities in allostatic load. The study will
also investigate the extent to which "Conserved Transcriptional Response to Adversity" (CTRA) gene
expression mediates the relationship between discrimination and allostatic load, as well as evaluate the
moderating effect of social integration on these associations. Overall, this study has the potential to inform the
optimization of existing clinical and place-based interventions aimed at reducing allostatic load by highlighting
the importance of addressing discrimination and identifying the timing, context, and most at-risk groups that
can benefit from these interventions to reduce health disparities.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Disorders of gut-brain interactions (DGBIs), the most common GI problems world-wide, are characterized by
recurring, chronic gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms including dysmotility (constipation/diarrhea), GI pain and
abnormal gut-brain communication. Treatment options for DGBIs are extremely limited due to a poor
understanding of their pathophysiology. What is known about DGBIs is that the majority of affected patients
have a co-morbid mood disorder, mainly anxiety (AD) but also depression (DD). Like DGBIs, AD and DD are
common and with limited treatment options. Further, studies show an increased risk of DGBI development
with a pre-existent mood disorder and vice versa. Identifying links between DBGIs and mood disorders is
thus highly likely to elucidate mechanisms that instigate development of novel therapies for both conditions.
The transmitter, serotonin (5-HT) modulates symptoms of DGBIs, AD and DD, leading many treatments to be
targeted towards 5-HT regulation. In particular, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are highly
prescribed. Yet, SSRIs have severe limitations: low remission (<50%) and resolution (<1/3) rates and;
adverse effects (e.g., GI pain, dysmotility, and [paradoxical] anxiety). SSRIs function by inhibiting the
serotonin reuptake transporter (SERT), thus increasing 5-HT transmission. SERT is located in the CNS, ENS
and the GI epithelium and SSRIs are systemically absorbed, leading to SSRI action/SERT antagonism in the
CNS, ENS and GI epithelium. Yet, it is not known where SSRIs precisely act to induce their beneficial versus
adverse effects. Our data show that: (1) beneficial SSRI effects (anxiolytic, anti-depressive, anti-nociceptive)
result from SERT antagonism in the GI epithelium and may involve vagal- and 5-HT3-mediated signaling and;
(2) detrimental SSRI effects result from ENS or CNS SERT antagonism (AD, dysmotility, pain). Thus,
selective pharmacologic blockade of GI epithelial SERT could be beneficial for treating DGBIs, AD and DD
without producing negative effects linked to systemic SSRI exposure. We have created a state-of-the-art
SSRI delivery system that maximally disperses and retains SSRI locally on the intestinal epithelium while
minimizing systemic absorption. We now propose to: (1) elucidate the roles of vagal signaling in linking gut
epithelial 5-HT to beneficial effects on GI pain and mood; (2) examine how ENS SERT ablation affects DGBI
symptoms and mood, to determine if avoidance of ENS SERT antagonism is necessary to prevent negative
and efficacy-reducing effects of systemic SSRIs; (3) determine whether our novel SSRI delivery platform
provides the beneficial mood effects of SSRIs while avoiding deleterious effects on GI pain, GI motility and
mood. If successful, the platform is known to be safe so can be efficiently translated to clinical studies.

Despite therapeutic advances, cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of death worldwide.
There is thus an urgent need for innovation in CVD research and drug development. One class of molecules
thought to hold particular promise is noncoding RNA, the importance of which was largely unrecognized until the
last decade. The human genome is estimated to encode between 30,000 and 60,000 long noncoding RNAs
(lncRNA), far more than the number of protein coding transcripts, and yet the vast majority remain unstudied.
LncRNAs have been shown to play critical roles in genome organization and orchestration of gene expression
in normal cellular function and disease. Discerning lncRNAs with regulatory functions in cardiovascular health
and disease, and dissecting their molecular mechanisms is a paramount priority, and challenge, for the field.
Using a systems biology approach that relies on human tissues and animal models, clinical data, predictive
bioinformatics and deep molecular phenotyping, we have identified a conserved cis-acting lncRNA, which we
have named CASLR, that is highly expressed in human and mouse atherosclerotic plaques. In this proposal, we
aim to decipher the molecular mechanisms by which this novel lncRNA regulates inflammatory gene expression,
and innate immune responses that drive atherosclerosis progression and ultimately plaque rupture, which can
lead to myocardial infarction or stroke. Our studies will use novel mouse models and innovative 3-dimensional
human vascular explants to test the impact of CASLR inhibition on atherosclerotic inflammation and plaque
burden. Collectively, the proposed investigation into lncRNA CASLR will advance our knowledge of inflammatory
mechanisms of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and its complications, and provide foundational studies
for the design of new therapeutic strategies.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT ABSTRACT
Statins reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events and mortality. However, providers fail to
prescribe statin therapy for about half of patients meeting guideline criteria for initiation. The electronic health
record (EHR) creates opportunities to develop clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) to support
cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk recognition, assessment, and management. However, low provider adoption
has limited the clinical impact of CDSSs designed to improve guideline-concordant statin prescribing.
Integrating insights from behavioral economics into CDSS design represents a novel approach to improving
adoption by minimizing key barriers - provider time and cognitive load burden. Behavioral economics studies
the effects of psychological, social, cognitive, and emotional factors on the decisions of individuals and uses
nudges to influence behavior at a largely unconscious level. Nudges are defined as positive reinforcement and
indirect suggestions which have a non-forced effect on decision-making. For example, “opt-out” options for
organ donation consent lead to striking differences in enrollment. Nudges represent an exciting and novel
approach to developing CDSSs that minimize provider burden and are, therefore, more efficient, scalable, and
impactful (i.e., optimized). The overall objective of this proposal is to develop and optimize a CDSS, including
several nudges, to increase guideline-concordant statin prescribing for CVD risk (Nudge-CVD-CDSS). We use
an innovative, engineering-inspired multiphase optimization strategy (MOST) framework to arrive at an
intervention that is not just efficacious or effective but efficient and scalable. Several potential intervention
components (EHR-nudges) will be developed, usability tested, revised, and evaluated. A randomized trial
using a specialized design will evaluate the individual and combined effects of nudges. We will seek the
combination of nudges that maximizes impact on guideline-concordant statin prescribing while minimizing
provider time and cognitive load burden. Specific Aims: 1) To develop, based on a conceptual model of the
prescribing process, a set of potential intervention components (EHR-nudges) to promote and support
AHA/ACC guideline-concordant statin prescribing, 2) To revise potential intervention components through
iterative usability testing, including real-time measures of provider time and cognitive load burden and 3) To
use a randomized trial with a specialized design to identify which EHR-nudges, or combinations of nudges,
contribute most efficiently to AHA/ACC guideline-concordant statin prescribing. The proposed work is
significant in its efforts to develop an effective, efficient, and scalable intervention to improve guideline-
concordant care for CVD risk management. It is innovative in its use of insights from behavioral economics and
the MOST framework to optimize a CDSS by balancing clinical impact with provider time and cognitive load
burden. Achieving the project’s objectives will advance the science of CDSS design and development.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Visual sensory substitution devices, in which images from a video camera are converted to a cross-modal signal
that is then presented to the subjects in place of direct visual information, offer an alternative, non-surgical
approach for the blind to appreciate aspects of their immediate environment. These non-invasive, low-cost
technologies can also offer higher visual acuity and wider fields of view than currently available retinal and
cortical implants. However, sensory substitution devices are rarely adopted to interpret and translate complex,
natural environments for daily use by blind individuals partly because of their impracticality. In addition, little is
known about the perceptual and behavioral consequences of delivering new patterns of information as an
alternative sense when the visual system is damaged at different ages. The metabolic and functional processes
that allow the deprived human visual cortex for enhancing cross-modal plasticity have not been clearly defined
either. These research gaps must be filled before sensory substitution can be exploited as a method of vision
rehabilitation for improving function and independence while reducing the associated costs of blindness. The
goal of this project is to develop and refine sensory substitution technologies and to identify the determinants of
cross-modal plasticity in brains deprived of visual input in order to facilitate sensory substitution. To achieve this
goal, we will incorporate artificial intelligence (AI) to simplify images of complex, natural environments into
isolated objects for sensory substitution. We will then use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and spectroscopy
(MRS), combined with behavioral assessments to examine the neural substrates of sensory substitution in early
and late blind subjects. We will leverage tactile and auditory substitution stimuli to determine how changes in
neurochemicals reflect the cross-modal activity of visually deprived brains. We will also test how training with AI
can help blind individuals interpret visual environmental cues in a more meaningful way. Feedback from the
behavioral and neurobiological results will help refine our sensory substitution devices. Aim 1: To improve
sensory substitution toward practical use, we will use AI and 3D coding to convert complex everyday scenarios
into simplified and aesthetically engaging versions that aid both immediate task performance and sensory
substitution training. Aim 2: To determine how visual processing pathways in the brain adapt to vision loss, we
will employ advanced MRI and MRS to unveil the structural, metabolic, and functional brain properties in
participants with different onset ages and durations of blindness before training. Aim 3: To determine the effects
of sensory substitution training on visual processing pathways and performance of the blind, we will use
advanced MRI and MRS to determine if cross-modal perceptual learning alters the deprived visual cortex toward
a more plastic state via modulating its excitatory-inhibitory balance and choline levels. We will also examine the
neurobehavioral changes that occur when identifying and locating the objects of interest using auditory or tactile
stimuli with and without AI-assisted image deconstruction.

Close HLA matching of kidney donors to their recipients plays a vital role in graft survival. However,
prioritizing antigen-level HLA matching in US deceased donor allocation leads to racial disparities in access to
well-matched donors. Only 3.04% of transplants to Black recipients between 2000 and 2017 were the lowest-
risk 0-ABDR antigen mismatch, compared to 13.95% for Whites. Recent advances in precision
histocompatibility testing have improved alloimmune risk stratification for kidney transplants, and prioritizing
low molecular mismatch instead of low antigen mismatch could significantly increase graft survival. Molecular
mismatch better identifies high-risk recipients who have much greater odds of developing new dnDSA (HR:
23) and antibody-mediated rejection (HR: 5) compared to low-risk recipients. While molecular HLA matching
increases graft survival, the impact of prioritizing molecular mismatch in US deceased donor kidney allocation,
including the number of years of additional graft life and whether such matching might have disparate impacts
by race, ethnicity, or gender is unknown. The preferred molecular matching paradigm, and whether to
prioritize more moderate or fewer exceptional donor/recipient matches remain uncertain.
We will use a detailed simulation to project impacts of prioritizing molecular-level rather than antigen-level
matching, while adjusting candidates’ allocation score by our novel metric, personalized immunologic
compatibility likelihood (PICL). The PICL adjustment aims to balance the biological difficulty in finding well-
matched donors, similar to the current adjustment performed to account for the candidates’ sensitization level
(CPRA). While HLA genotyping to measure molecular mismatch isn't standard practice for donors and
recipients currently, the technology is expected to be available within the next 2-3 years. Using our high-
resolution HLA genotyping dataset, derived from a pool of over 2.77 million stem cell donors across seven US
racial/ethnic groups, we will create simulated pools of waitlist candidates and donors and compute each
candidate's PICL. We have the following aims:
(1) Estimate graft survival benefits of prioritizing molecular HLA matching prioritization in the US deceased
donor kidney allocation, augmenting existing simulation tools to model molecular matching. (2) Develop a
personalized immunologic compatibility likelihood (PICL) metric, and measure antigen/molecular match
likelihood distributions across candidate racial groups, to characterize inequities in the probability of finding a
well-matched donor in the US deceased donor pool. (3) Incorporate PICL into deceased donor allocation to
promote equity, using simulation optimization algorithms to design a points system that increases graft
survival and mitigates disparities in the transplant rate and the rate of well-matched transplants.

Clinically, atrophy of the intrinsic laryngeal musculature is poorly defined likely related to limited understanding
of fundamental biological processes underlying this complex, aberrant tissue phenotype. This lack of insight
underlies suboptimal therapeutic strategies for these challenging patients. In addition to fundamental
investigation regarding this phenotype, we hypothesize that initiation and maintenance of atrophy of the
intrinsic laryngeal musculature is related to signaling events in the mucosa. Specifically, our laboratory
elucidated the role of TGF-β signaling with an emphasis on therapeutic strategies targeting the SMAD family of
signaling proteins in the vocal fold lamina propria. SMADs, however, also mediate muscle atrophy in other
systems, specifically through regulation of atrogenes and myostatin, a member of the TGF-β superfamily. We
hypothesize that the inherent response to injury in the lamina propria elicits and/or enhances an atrophic in the
muscle. This concept is inherently innovative in that it refutes clinical dogma suggesting the vocal fold mucosa
and muscle of the vocal folds operate as wholly separate and distinct entities. In that regard, we propose to
interrogate fundamental and functional laryngeal muscle outcomes of recurrent laryngeal nerve injury-mediated
thyroarytenoid atrophy in the context of both acute and chronic mucosal injury. In addition, we seek to
interrogate key biochemical relationships and interactions between multiple cell types from the vocal folds to
provide foundational insight into processes underling atrophy. And finally, we seek to provide preliminary data
related to therapeutic strategies to prevent/treat laryngeal muscle atrophy targeting SMAD signaling.
Ultimately, these data represent substantive contributions to the literature and are foundational for the
development of novel treatment strategies for millions of patients with disability related to voice disorders and
laryngeal disease.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Summary
Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a highly aggressive and lethal disease, accounting for about 15% of all lung
cancers. SCLC patients often initially respond to chemotherapy; however, their tumors invariably recur within 6
to 12 months. Treatment regimens for SCLC have remained largely unchanged for the past decades.
Nonetheless, the addition of immunotherapy (such as anti-PD-L1 therapy) to chemotherapy was recently
approved for the first-line treatment of adult patients with extensive-stage SCLC (ES-SCLC). Although the clinical
benefit of adding anti-PD-L1 has been modest with an increase in median overall survival (OS) of approximately
2 months, these results have suggested that anti-tumor immunity can play a role in SCLC treatment. Notably,
there are limited options for treating SCLC with targeted agents, emphasizing the critical need for identifying new
targets and treatment paradigms. Our proposed studies address these unmet needs. SCLC has been
increasingly recognized as a highly heterogeneous disease, which is largely regulated by four transcription
factors (TFs). Neuroendocrine (NE) SCLC subtypes have been characterized by differential expression of the
ASCL1 and NEUROD1 TFs and non-NE SCLCs by POU2F3 and YAP1. A recent study demonstrated an
essential role of master regulator MYC in driving the evolution dynamics of these subtypes of SCLC, postulating
their dependence on mutual transcriptional and epigenetic programs for tumor initiation and survival. We aim to
leverage our recent discoveries for targeted therapy and state-of-the-art preclinical platform to identify novel
strategies that mitigate the common dependencies in heterogenous SCLC. We previously demonstrated that
SCLC cells are addicted to a CDK7-regulated gene expression program mediated, in part, by oncogenic
members of the MYC family of TFs and proto-oncogenic NE lineage TFs. Furthermore, our recent data has
uncovered a previously unrecognized role of MUC1-C in regulating common oncogenic transcriptomes in both
NE and non-NE SCLC. In addition, we have successfully established multiple orthotopic murine SCLC models,
which represent the four SCLC subtypes that include SCLC-ASCL1, -NEUROD1, -YAP1 and -POU2F3.
Importantly, these murine models have an intact lung immune system making them a powerful resource for
immune-oncology studies. Utilizing this preclinical platform, we will 1). evaluate the efficacy of MUC1-C inhibitor
alone and in combination with CDK7 inhibitor in NE and non-NE SCLC in vitro and in vivo; 2). define the TME
alterations induced by MUC1-C inhibition alone and in combination with CDK7 inhibition; and 3). define the
cancer intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms by which MUC1-C and CDK7 inhibition alone and in combination
contribute to antitumor immunity. Ultimately, characterizing the underlying mechanisms associated with
responses to our targeted therapies will help develop tailored treatment for SCLC patients.

Oncoproteins drive tumor development and aggressive growth by dysregulating the signaling pathways involved
in cell growth, survival, and proliferation. Targeting oncoproteins directly, or their downstream pathways, has
resulted in novel therapies currently being used for the treatment of different cancer subtypes.
The RAS family of guanosine triphosphatase (GTP) hydrolases (GTPases) are a group of oncoproteins, that
have roles in cancer initiation, progression, and resistance to therapies. Furthermore, mutations in genes
encoding classical RAS proteins are very frequent in cancer. RAS proteins cycle between a guanosine
diphosphate (GDP) inactive form and a GTP active form. In its GTP-bound conformation, RAS proteins promote
activation of downstream signaling pathways that contribute to the growth and proliferation of cells. This
nucleotide cycle is assisted by accessory proteins that catalyze the loading or hydrolysis of GTP and
dysregulation of this mechanism is also frequent in cancer.
Emerging evidence has shown that non-classical RAS proteins also play critical roles in cancer biology; however,
their mechanisms of regulation and tumorigenesis are not well-understood and differ from classical RAS proteins.
We have recently discovered a novel mechanism of regulation of the non-classical RAS proteins RIT1 and MRAS
that is mediated by ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of the inactive GDP-bound form. Our work
identified LZTR1, a novel protein that binds RIT1 and MRAS and forms a complex with the E3 Ubiquitin ligase
Cullin-3 (CRL3LZTR1). Cancer-associated mutations in RIT1 or LZTR1 disrupt their interaction and lead to the
accumulation of non-classical RAS GTPases and activation of downstream signaling.
In this application, we propose to study critical aspects regarding the regulation of this novel complex, its
contribution to tumorigenesis, and potential pharmacological strategies to restore protein degradation.
In Aim 1, we will use biochemical and structural approaches to understand the determinants of LZTR1 selectivity
towards the non-classical RAS GTPases RIT1 and MRAS and the function of its protein domains.
In Aim 2, we plan to elucidate the signaling mechanisms that regulate CRL3LZTR1 activity in cells and how these
pathways can contribute to the resistance to specific targeted therapies.
In Aim 3, we will develop novel mouse models that are driven by an oncogenic RIT1 mutation that is resistant to
LZTR1-mediated proteasomal degradation and analyze the molecular signatures of these tumors. In addition,
we will develop proof-of-concept pharmacological treatments for RIT1-driven cancers.
Overall, our project will address a major knowledge gap in the mechanisms of regulation of non-classical RAS
oncoproteins and will provide novel preclinical models and therapeutic strategies for these cancers. The work
described in this application is the first step to develop mechanism-based and precise medicines for targeting
these oncogenic pathways in cancer.

Treating KRAS mutant lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) remains a major challenge for clinical oncology.
Approximately 20% of KRAS mutant LUAD tumors carry loss-of-function mutations in KEAP1, a negative
regulator of NRF2, which is the master transcriptional regulator of the endogenous antioxidant response. Using
CRISPR/Cas9-based somatic editing in a genetically engineered mouse model of KRAS-driven LUAD we
demonstrated that loss of Keap1 hyper-activates Nrf2 and dramatically accelerates KRAS-driven LUAD.
Combining CRISPR/Cas9-based genetic screening and metabolic analyses, we showed that Keap1 mutant cells
are dependent on increased glutamine metabolism, and this property can be therapeutically exploited through
the pharmacological inhibition. In this application we focus on characterizing the molecular mechanisms and
therapeutic potential of targeting glutamine metabolism in KRAS-driven KEAP1 mutant LUAD This application
aims to: 1) Assess the therapeutic potential of novel glutamine antagonist in both human and murine KRASG12D-
and KRASG12C-driven KEAP1 mutant LUAD pre-clinical models, 2) Provide a rationale for sub-stratification of
human lung cancer patients with KRAS-KEAP1 or -NRF2 mutant tumors as likely responders to glutamine
antagonists and determine the therapeutic potential of combining with clinically relevant KC-Is with DRP-104. 3)
Characterize the metabolic mechanisms underlying glutamine antagonist sensitivity in KRAS-driven KEAP1
mutant LUAD, and 4) Identify mechanisms of resistance to glutamine dependence. Our studies will provide a
rationale for sub-stratification of patients with hyperactivation of the NRF2 pathway as treatment responders to
DRP-104, a novel glutamine antagonist in clinical trials, which is pertinent to the goals of precision medicine.

VEXAS (Vacuoles, E1 enzyme, X-linked, Autoinflammatory, Somatic) syndrome is a newly identified
inflammatory and hematologic disease caused by somatic mutations in UBA1. Individuals with UBA1 mutations
have clinical manifestations similar to well-established rheumatic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and giant
cell arteritis but have unique manifestations including elevated mortality and treatment-refractory disease.
1/14,000 individuals are affected by VEXAS syndrome, and there are no effective treatments due to a limited
understanding of pathogenesis. We propose to further the mechanistic understanding of the disease as a first
step in developing treatments.
VEXAS syndrome is caused by hypomorphic mutations in UBA1 that lead to a reduction in global ubiquitylation.
UBA1 mutations are acquired and occur in the earliest bone marrow progenitor cells, become lineage restricted,
and accumulate within the myeloid lineage and are absent in lymphocytes. We have extensively studied cellular
models and patient derived cells to better understand the mechanism of disease in VEXAS syndrome. We have
identified multiple activated inflammatory pathways, although given the complexity of treatments and symptoms
in patients, these have not revealed pathogenic processes. Similarly, in UBA1 mutant cells there is activation of
the unfolded protein response likely due to accumulation of proteins intended to be degraded. Given the severity
of the disease, the lack of effective therapies, and the limited utility of cellular models to date, we propose here
to focus our work on our newly established mouse models of VEXAS syndrome to understand the cellular and
molecular mechanisms leading to disease. To this end, we will utilize conditional knockout (cKO) UBA1 and
conditional knock-in (cKI) UBA1 VEXAS mutations transgenic mouse lines to determine the contribution of
specific lineages to inflammation, the types of inflammation, downstream pathways mediating inflammation and
finally potential ways to reverse disease. We will study our Uba1 cKO, and cKI lines in bone marrow progenitor,
myeloid, B- and T-cells and determine the role of each cell type in driving organismal inflammation (Aim 1). We
will also look at these cell specific models to identify the molecular signaling pathways altered in cells mediating
inflammation (Aim 2). Finally, we will utilize small molecule activators and inhibitors in candidate pathways such
as ubiquitylation and the unfolded protein response to try to reverse inflammation in mouse and cellular models.
Our overall goal is to better define VEXAS syndrome inflammation and molecular signing to enable improved
therapies.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：The inability to slow or revert progression to posttraumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA) after injury has devastating
consequences for a young population, whose only therapeutic option remains knee replacement at a young age.
Despite extensive research, PTOA pathophysiology continues to be poorly understood which translates in
suboptimal diagnosis tools and limited treatment options. Although there is consensus that cell death (apoptosis)
and low-grade inflammation play a major role in PTOA onset, we lack understanding on how these factors tip
the healing response to injury into a vicious cycle of perpetuating joint damage. Unfortunately, blocking
inflammation or apoptosis alone has proven to be insufficient to prevent progression to PTOA. In our preliminary
studies we found a synergistic interaction between apoptotic articular chondrocytes and the inflammatory
response of synovial cells that exacerbates apoptosis and inflammation creating a devastating production of pro-
inflammatory and catabolic signaling. Thus, we hypothesize that a combinatorial treatment targeting apoptosis
and inflammation is needed to reinstate joint homeostasis after injury. Here we propose a comprehensive
approach to characterize the crosstalk between inflammation and apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. We will identify
in vitro the crosstalk mechanisms and the molecular interplay between apoptosis and inflammation by analyzing
the transcriptome of articular chondrocytes and synovial cells exposed to one or both stimuli and by
characterizing the paracrine signaling. In vitro studies will allow us to study single interactions between cells and
stimuli. We will then assess inflammation and apoptosis in vivo. Studying the dynamic crosstalk between events
in knee joints represents a major challenge since we need to capture two processes in the same animal in vivo
overtime. Molecular imaging represents a natural approach that can capture both inflammation and apoptosis in
the same animal overtime and make possible the study of the dynamic synergistic interaction between these two
processes. We will combine our novel MRI contrast agent that detects pro-inflammatory signaling in articular
cartilage, with optical imaging agents targeting apoptosis and a positron emission tomography (PET) tracer
targeting the folate receptor expressed in activated macrophages. This multimodal imaging approach will allow
longitudinal assessment of the activity and timing of inflammation and apoptosis during the progression to PTOA.
We will investigate in vivo the effect of blocking apoptosis has in inflammation and vice versa. Finally, a
combinatorial treatment targeting apoptosis and inflammation will be explored to reinstate joint homeostasis after
injury. These studies will lay the groundwork for the development of therapeutic strategies targeting the crosstalk
between apoptosis and inflammation but also contribute to a fundamental understanding of how the interplay of
crucial pathological mechanism can contribute to PTOA onset.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is home to two-thirds of all people living with HIV (PLHIV). Widely-adopted targets
such as “95-95-95” (diagnosing ≥95% of PLHIV, treating ≥95% of those diagnosed, and achieving viral load
suppression in ≥95% of those on treatment) have fueled tremendous progress in access and effective use of
HIV treatment, with surveillance from Population HIV Impact Assessments (PHIAs) used to monitor progress.
Although these efforts have reduced HIV incidence and mortality, HIV/AIDS remains the leading cause of
death among SSA adults, and HIV incidence remains high, with many regions not on track to achieve the
Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) of HIV incidence <0.1% per person-year by 2030. Pre-exposure
prophylaxis (PrEP) has been shown to dramatically reduce HIV acquisition risk when taken as directed.
However, at a population level, PrEP use in SSA is still limited. Several modeling studies, including our own,
suggest the SDG could be achieved in much of SSA with sufficient expansions in PrEP access and use.
A challenge for PrEP expansion in SSA is the lack of established targets, and lack of surveillance to monitor
progress toward targets. Such target-setting-and-tracking approaches have been remarkably successful in
driving scale-up of HIV treatment and monitoring progress through PHIAs. Our central hypothesis is that PrEP
research data can be used to derive setting-specific PrEP coverage targets corresponding to incidence
reduction goals, which can be monitored using population-based drug measurements as a “PHIA for PrEP.”
Several innovations are needed to enable a “PHIA for PrEP.” First (Aim 1), the relationship between drug
concentrations measured and reduction in HIV incidence needs to be established. This was previously
accomplished for men who have sex with men (MSM) in the Global North. We will determine this relationship
using pooled PrEP study data from SSA, where transmission is predominantly heterosexual. Second (Aim 2),
the totality of the effects of PrEP program participation need to be understood, which may extend beyond the
pharmacological effects of PrEP drugs. Several studies have measured HIV incidence reductions among non-
adherent participants and those taking placebos, suggesting PrEP program participation may serve as a
“gateway” to behavioral risk reduction. We will estimate these effects using pooled study results from post-
licensure SSA PrEP pilots and demonstration projects. Third (Aim 3), PrEP target-setting needs to account for
differential HIV risk across population groups and settings. We will use agent-based HIV transmission
modeling to estimate a range of PrEP coverage configurations that achieve epidemic targets, with trade-offs
between coverage vs. adherence and between overall coverage vs. targeting those most-at-risk. Cognizant of
stigma, accessibility, and other challenges, we will engage policy-makers, advocates, community advisory
boards, as well as experts in HIV trials, surveys, and bioethics, to weigh PrEP target options and design
monitoring strategies using a “PHIA for PrEP.”

Neurotrophic a-herpesvirus including herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV1) establish lifelong, latent (non-replicating)
infections in sensory and sympathetic neurons. Recurring reactivation episodes triggered in response to
physiological stress interrupt latency and allow virus reproduction, shedding and spread to new hosts. While it
has long been known that HSV1 reactivation can be triggered by a perplexing variety of physiological and
neurological stresses, the underlying molecular mechanisms have remained obscure. Recent studies using
cultured primary neurons to model HSV1 latency and reactivation, allows us to build a detailed but still incomplete
picture of how the virus is maintained in a dormant state and how stress response pathways converge to disrupt
this control leading to reactivation. By applying cutting-edge single cell technologies to a well-defined primary
neuron infection model, we have now identified neuronal factors that are rapidly mobilized in response to HSV1
reactivation and have the potential to block the virus replication program at a defined stage. The long-reaching
goal of this project is to elucidate the molecular mechanisms responsible for this cell-intrinsic host response. We
propose studies to identify the viral reactivation signature recognized by the host neuron and will determine why
virus gene expression is selectively inhibited. Furthermore, our multifaceted approach will allow us to decipher
the complex relationship between a viral parasite and its human host. By defining the molecular processes
involved in regulating the behavior of latent virus we hope to gain a better understanding how neurons can be
protected from a wide range of intrinsic and extrinsic insults.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
B cells are critical for immune responses to infection and in many forms of autoimmune disease. They develop
in the bone marrow and migrate to lymph nodes and spleen, where they further mature. At the end of this process,
B cells express a high affinity B cell receptor with which they recognize antigen and which allows them to develop
further into either memory B cells or long-lived plasma cells. Both types of cells migrate to the bone marrow and
provide long-term protection from reinfection with the same pathogen. Plasma cells are a B cell type that
produces large quantities of antibodies that are critical for neutralizing pathogens such as influenza virus, or
more recently, SARS-CoV2. Several forms of primary immunodeficiency are caused by defects in B cell
development or maturation including agammaglobulinemia and common variable immunodeficiency (CVID),
which are characterized by a complete or partial lack of antibody production. Underlying these forms of
immunodeficiency are mutations in a plethora of genes that encode transcription factors, cell surface receptors
and signal transduction molecules. Some of these mutations occur in genes encoding ion channels. Ion channels
are located in the cell membrane or membranes of intracellular organelles. They function as gateways to mediate
the transport of charged ions such as calcium, zinc or chloride. Inherited mutations in two ion channels were
shown to prevent the development of B cells resulting in agammaglobulinemia. Studies in mice have identified
additional ion channels that are required for B cell function. Overall however, the role of ion channels in B cells
is poorly understood with only a handful of the more than 600 known ion channel genes implicated in B cell
function to date. This is even more extreme for plasma cells because no ion channel has yet been reported that
specifically regulates plasma cell development or function. This lack of information is in strong contrast to the
well established role of ion channels in cells of the brain, nerves, heart, muscle or kidney. It also represents a
missed opportunity from a basic science perspective and our ability to understand how immune responses to
infection are regulated, and from a therapeutic perspective because ion channels are excellent drug targets.
Drugs modulating ion channel function are a mainstay in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases, neurological
and psychiatric disorders and type 2 diabetes. We have therefore conducted genetic screens to identify novel
ion channels that regulate the development of B cells into plasma cells and identified around 10 such channels.
We investigated several of these further and confirmed that inhibiting their expression in B cells interferes with
plasma cell development. In this proposal, we will focus on two of these channels and determine the molecular
and cellular mechanisms by which they control the development of B cells into plasma cells and their ability to
mount an antibody response to infection with viral pathogens such as influenza.

Loss of myelin, as seen in conditions like multiple sclerosis, frequently leads to balance issues. These dis-
ruptions in balance are attributed to the compromised function of neural circuits associated with the vestibu-
lar system. Despite the clinical significance of this problem, our understanding of how myelin loss affects the
functioning of these circuits remains limited. Consequently, there is a pressing need to elucidate the mecha-
nisms underlying the impact of myelin, its loss and restoration on circuit function. To address these questions,
I propose using zebrafish larvae as a model. They allow for in vivo observation of myelinated axons and func-
tional/behavioral testing. My preliminary data using a pharmacological hypomyelination model showed specific
changes in pitch sensitivity linked to a particular circuit, the vestibulospinal circuit. My aim is to understand the
role of myelin in behavior and circuit function, as well as the deficits caused by myelin loss and potential rescue
through remyelination.
In the K99 phase, I will (1) investigate changes in vestibulospinal circuit neuron responses to body tilts after
hypomyelination, (2) analyze postural and functional deficits after targeted demyelination, and (3) develop a
novel tool for circuit-specific myelin manipulations. These experiments will define the impact of demyelination
on vestibular processing and postural instability. Successful completion will provide functional characterization
of vestibular circuits and validate a selective myelin disruption tool. In the R00 phase, I will (1) explore mech-
anisms of neuronal and behavioral recovery after remyelination and (2) create conditional myelin inhibitors to
model circuit-specific incomplete remyelination. Achieving these goals will shed light on circuit-specific effects
of remyelination after loss.
My long-term goal is to run an independent laboratory using larval zebrafish to (1) understand the mechanisms
by which loss of myelin disrupts neural circuit function and behavior and (2) understand how remyelination
rescues behavioral and functional deficits. To achieve this, my lab will leverage the behavioral technologies I
have used in the first stage of my post-doctoral training, the functional imaging I will master in the K99 training
phase, and my previous training as a molecular and cellular glia -biologist. The proposed studies target an un-
met need: understanding the role of myelin in a circuit specific manner. This work is broadly significant as it ad-
vances our understanding of the relationship of myelin, circuit function and behavior with implications for novel
treatment approaches for demyelinating diseases.

The ability to perceive and respond to vocalizations across behavioral contexts is key for survival, but the
mechanisms for how the brain derives meaning from acoustic features to drive appropriate behavioral responses
remain unknown. I will test the overall hypothesis that top-down control of feed-forward auditory circuits via
cortical projection neurons is critical for recognition of social calls and routing of sensory information to circuits
driving behavior. In the mentored (K99) phase, I will take advantage of an ethological mouse behavior studied
extensively in my postdoctoral lab, in which parentally-experienced mice search for lost pups in response to a
specific type of vocalization. Experienced moms are experts at this behavior, but it can also be learned by virgins,
and learning is correlated with plasticity in the left auditory cortex in females. Pup retrieval involves a complex
sequence of actions, and auditory cues may be required during specific epochs. I will build upon my pilot data
finding that cortical projection neurons are necessary for retrieval, and that exposure to pup calls drives sustained
activity in a distinct projection in experienced females. Aim 1 (K99) uses imaging and multi-area ensemble
recordings to ask how inter-area dynamics in recurrent auditory circuits change during pup calls compared to
non-vocal sounds with similar temporal structures, with the hypothesis that network activity is elevated
specifically during vocalizations to facilitate brain state modulation or communication with sensorimotor circuits
over time scales relevant for behavior. Synaptic mechanisms driving this persistent activity will be examined with
in vivo whole-cell recordings. Aim 2 (K99) will test which projection neurons are required for retrieval and over
what behavioral time scales. Animals vocalize in multiple situations to communicate distinct meanings – for
example, male calls to communicate aggression or courtship – and the brain must make sense of these calls,
using acoustic features as well as non-auditory context cues to distinguish between meanings. In the
independent phase (R00), Aim 3 asks whether calls are processed with neural ensembles and inter-area
dynamics that are generalized across categories or distinct for specific behavioral outcomes. Additionally, the
relevance of different social calls can change depending on an animal’s internal state. Aim 4 (R00) investigates
whether neural ensemble representations of male calls change in female mice as sexual receptivity varies,
measuring activity in cortical ensembles tracked over weeks of experience. In the mentored phase I will complete
a training plan designed to strengthen the experimental and computational skills needed for my research
program as an independent investigator, and to build the professional skills needed for success as a faculty
member, taking advantage of resources and expertise available from the mentor, advisory committee and
broader environment at NYU.

Proper skin restoration after the damage is vital for organismal survival. The lymphatic vascular system is spread
throughout the human body and has a critical function in mammalian physiology. In physiological conditions, its
main function is the regulation of tissue drainage, immunosurveillance, and regeneration. Lymphatic dysfunction
causes lymphedema a medical condition that manifests as tissue swelling and fibrosis. This serious condition
results in profound severe delays in wound repair and the formation of chronic non-healing wounds. The
mechanism by which lymphatic vessels regulate skin repair is unexplored. Additionally, while the role of
lymphatic vessels in immune cell egress from tissues is well-established, how lymphatic vessels may directly
modulate immune function in damaged tissues is poorly-defined. Recently, I discovered that lymphatic vessels
are actively remodeled during wound healing to form small capillaries which are present in close localization to
the wound front and hair follicles. This remodeling is critical for optimal repair as skin-specific loss of lymphatic
vessels results in a significant delay in wound closure accompanied by a massive infiltration of immune cells.
This proposal aims to leverage these observations by 1) delineating the mechanisms and consequences of
lymphatic vessel remodeling during skin repair, and 2) determining the role of lymphatic vessels and fluid
pressure in macrophage behavior during skin repair. This research stands to have a significant clinical impact
because it can serve as a basis for developing new therapeutic avenues for lymphedema ulcers and chronic
wound management. In addition, career-oriented guidance from my mentor and advisors, along with career
development activated during the K99 phase that includes formal coursework on grant writing and project
management, will further facilitate my transition to the R00 phase and my long-term productivity as an
independent academic investigator. Collectively, the proposed research and career development plans are
expected to generate data with a significant impact on understanding the repair and immunomodulatory functions
of lymphatic vessels in skin repair and setting the basis of my future research as an independent researcher.

Cell identity is acquired by integrating multiple signaling inputs that establish complex gene regulatory
networks over time. These signals are converted into expression profiles by the binding of transcription factors
to non-coding regions of DNA known as enhancers. In human adipogenesis, multiple inputs converge onto a
single gene, PPARG. PPARG responds to these inputs through two "super-enhancers", which are dense
collections of individual enhancers. The myriad of input signals that feed into adipogenesis and drive PPARG
activation suggests the presence of complex regulatory logic within the two super-enhancers located up- and
downstream of the PPARG coding region. For instance, Creb1 is an early input in adipogenesis that appears
dispensable later, C/EBPb is required later and subsequently activates C/EBPa to maintain PPARG
transcription, and finally PPARG itself autoregulates to drive PPARG output even further, as adipocytes adopt
their terminal fate. The large genomic distances between enhancers and promoter, and the observation that
chromatin remodeling is a key bottleneck in adipogenesis suggesta hierarchical model of PPARγ activation.
We will systematically determine which functional units of the PPARG super-enhancers respond to diverse
inputs by silencing individual super-enhancer modules in a temporally resolved manner during adipogenesis.
We will combine these findings with direct observation and manipulation of chromatin contacts in single cells, in
order to test whether efficient signal transduction from super-enhancers to promoter requires 2-way
enhancer-promoter chromatin loops or complex multi-way contacts between super-enhancer modules and the
promoter.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：COVID-19 has resulted in a significant burden on the human population following the emergence of SARS-
CoV-2. Since the discovery of SARS-CoV-2 in 2019, millions have succumbed to infection due to an imbalanced
host response orchestrated by the biology of the virus. Characterization of the interactions between SARS-CoV-
2 and the infected host have revealed that the virus manipulates a small subset of signaling pathways culminating
in an overproduction of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines juxtaposed to an underproduction of type I
interferons, the central antiviral defense of vertebrates. An effort to identify kinase drug targets for the treatment
of COVID-19, as kinases represent ideal druggable targets, found that the p38 family of mitogen-activated protein
kinases (MAPKs) are among the most highly active kinases during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover,
perturbation of p38 kinases inhibited both virus replication and cytokine production. Thus, p38 kinases are
promising drug targets to block both virus replication and the excessive inflammation that is a hallmark of severe
COVID-19.
 In a subsequent study, a genetic perturbation approach was used to explore the p38/MAPK-SARS-CoV-2
interface and it was determined that the β isoform of the p38 kinase is an essential host factor for virus replication.
Additionally, inhibition of p38β reduces the abundance of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (N), but not viral
mRNA during infection. Contrary to the assumed pro-inflammatory activity of p38 kinases, findings suggested
p38β negatively regulates the expression of inflammatory cytokines. Lastly, p38-dependent phosphosites on
SARS-CoV-2 N were identified and mutation of these sites resulted in attenuated virus replication. Based on
these data, the overarching goal of the research proposed here is to test the hypothesize that p38β
phosphorylates both viral and host proteins to cumulatively promote SARS-CoV-2 replication and
modulate the host response.
 To further characterize the SARS-CoV-2-p38β interface, Aim 1 will explore the mechanism(s) responsible
for p38β's proviral activity and ascertain the contribution of this biology to the inflammatory response observed
in the context of COVID-19. To this end, viral protein stability will be assessed with translation inhibitors and
affinity-purification mass spectrometry to establish how p38β promotes the steady-state level of viral protein
during infection. In parallel, different immune agonists and genetic perturbations will be tested in Aim 2 to assess
the specificity of p38β-mediated downregulation of inflammatory cytokines and determine if altered expression
of these cytokines contributes to the proviral activity of p38β.
 By characterizing these p38β-SARS-CoV-2 interactions, the research proposed here will enhance the
understanding of SARS-CoV-2 biology, virus-host interactions, and p38β biology in order to inform the
development of novel drug therapies critically needed for the treatment of COVID-19.

Microbial communities and their hosts play a key role in many applications, including protecting humans or plants
against diseases or developing the next generation of biofuels and biological remediation systems needed for
sustainable growth. Gaining a deep understanding of the fundamental biology of these systems is the key to har-
nessing their potential. Advances in high-throughput multi-omics techniques like metagenomics, metatranscrip-
tomics, exometabolomics, and proteomics, allow us to capture multiple snapshots of these complex biological
processes at once. These snapshots create large-scale high-dimensional datasets of omics features (e.g., mi-
crobial species, microbial genes, proteins, and small molecules). The reduced cost has also allowed researchers
to collect more multi-omics time-series data. These temporally resolved multi-omics features can together provide
a comprehensive picture of biological processes and their underlying activities.
These well-designed multi-omics studies have not been analyzed to their fullest potential yet, primarily due to
the lack of appropriate tools and annotation databases required for such analyses. For example, systematically
investigating the time component of this longitudinal data to investigate the temporal dynamics of omics features
in relationship with disease activities is an unmet need in many studies. Therefore, there is a critical need for
statistical tools to greatly improve research infrastructure by integrating different data types and systematically
investigating the time component of this longitudinal data.
This project's overarching goal is to develop efﬁcient, interpretable, and scalable tools based on our previously
developed signal model, called partially-observed Boolean dynamical systems (POBDS), to characterize the time
component and capture the dynamical behavior of microbial communities through multi-omics data. The original
contributions can be organized across the following research goals:
(i) Developing novel methods in the POBDS context capable of modeling multi-omics data obtained through
 various molecular proﬁling technologies and various diseases/domains.
(ii) Developing Bayesian optimization frameworks for the efﬁcient and scalable reconstruction of the network
 topology of microbial communities (i.e., inferring the type of interactions between a large number of genes,
 bacteria, and microbes) through high dimensional multi-omics data.
(iii) Developing Bayesian reinforcement learning perturbation policies to decrease the number of data required
 for the modeling/learning process (overcoming the non-identiﬁability issue) and acquire the most informative
 data in microbial communities.
All the developed tools in this project will be presented in a user-friendly software/tool freely accessible to other
researchers.

Photodynamic therapy (PDT) offers unique mechanisms of cell death and is used to treat many cancers in the
clinic. The principal of phototherapy is that photoactive chemicals delivered to the disease site convert incident
photonic energy into local chemical toxicity, avoiding a systemic shock. PDT is agnostic to classical drug-
resistance pathways and does not cause critical co-morbidities, making it attractive as a monotherapy or as a
component of multi-modal therapy. However, a major criticism of PDT is the need for an external light source,
which limits the application of PDT to superficial lesions or those accessible by fiber optics. To overcome this,
a paradigm shift in the mechanism of light delivery for PDT has recently emerged: bioluminescence (BL)
mediated PDT (BL-PDT), wherein BL enzymes activate spectrally matched, co-localized photosensitizers (PS)
within the lesion, eliminating the need for an external light source. Although this overcomes a major hurdle,
current methods that leverage semiconductor nanoconstructs for BL enzyme delivery are limited in their ability
to localize to the disease. Here, we propose a novel method for BL enzyme delivery and BL-PDT: to
genetically engineer ultra-bright bioluminescent immune cells (UBLIs) and exploit their disease-homing
capabilities, like chemotaxis, to traffic to and accumulate in sites of disease. This approach eliminates the need
for complex and potentially toxic nanoconstructs as a component of drug delivery—only the BL substrate and
PS administration (both non-toxic compounds) will be required. Recently, we introduced precision
photomedicine using a targeted, activatable PS that exhibited cellular selectivity and reduced off-target toxicity
in a metastatic cancer model. We will pair the proposed novel light delivery platform with precision
photomedicine for maximal benefit. First, we will optimize the BL-PDT platform in 3D cancer–immune cell co-
cultures across biologically and clinically relevant parameter spaces informed by Monte Carlo simulations.
Then we will demonstrate the approach in vivo by intravenous injection of UBLIs into an in vivo xenograft
model of cancer metastases informed by in vitro results. These proof-of-concept studies will enable
comprehensive safety and efficacy studies in multiple disease models in future funding periods. Ultimately, we
envision clinical translation involving extraction and engineering of patient immune cells, similar to chimeric
antigen redirected (CAR) T cell therapy, followed by reinfusion and administration of photomedicine. This new
therapeutic paradigm has potential to benefit many diseases in cancer and beyond, which justifies the high-
risk, high-reward nature of the proposal.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
Dravet Syndrome (DS) is a devastating form of epilepsy caused by loss of function of NaV1.1 (80-90% of cases),
the predominant voltage-gated Na+ channel expressed in inhibitory (GABAergic) interneurons in the
hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. This causes a decrease in the release of inhibitory neurotransmitter (GABA),
resulting in hyperexcitability. The disease manifests itself within the first year of life and is usually triggered by
hyperthermia causing frequent and prolonged seizures that result in a host of health problems including
developmental delay, speech impairment, ataxia, hypotonia and sleep disturbances.
 Two small molecule monotherapies have been approved recently by the FDA: Epidiolex (Cannabidiol or
CBD) in 2018 and Fintepla (fenfluramine or FA) in 2020 for patients two years of age and older. Even though
they reduce the frequency of seizures, these drugs at their effective dosages cause multiple side effects. Their
mechanism(s) of action to reduce epileptiform activity remain(s) unknown.
 G protein-gated inwardly rectifying K+ (GIRK) channels have been strongly implicated in epilepsy. They are
activated by the Gβγ dimer of G proteins and by [Na+]i in a synergistic manner. The basis of synergism lies in
that they each work allosterically to control predominantly the two channel gates: Gβγ, the membrane gate and
Na+, the cytosolic gate. In the case of the GABAergic interneurons, we hypothesize that NaV1.1 and GIRK1/2
are coupled, such that the Na+ entering through NaV1.1 promotes GIRK1/2 activity to hyperpolarize the cell and
ensure removal of NaV1.1 inactivation for fast spiking. In DS this mechanism becomes compromised causing
cell depolarization and inactivation of voltage-gated channels at large present in GABAergic neurons failing to
compensate for the loss of NaV1.1. We use GAT1508, a specific activator of GIRK1/2 to compensate for the
compromised Na+ entry. Since GAT1508 opens the cytosolic gate, we ask whether it synergizes with CBD (via
CB1R) and FA (via 5-HT1DR) to open more fully the membrane gates. In Aim 1, experiments designed to test
the hypothesis are aimed at the cellular level in both heterologous expression and in native GABAergic neurons.
In Aims 2 and 3, we utilize a DS mouse model, heterozygous for the Scn1a gene that encodes NaV1.1, and in
Aim 2, we test the hypothesis at the brain slice level, where synapses and transmitter release remain intact, and
compare the DS model to a wild-type animal model. In Aim 3, we pursue experiments at the whole animal level
(DS model), using simultaneous EEG and 2-photon microscopy to monitor the neuronal circuits involved.

The control of movement, in spite of its seemingly effortless execution, belies a complex, multi-level collective of
neuromuscular interactions tuned and coordinated through sensory experience. Efficient and flexible behavior
in everyday contexts requires neural mechanisms that support rapid updating whenever objects around us, or
even our own movements, are disrupted during ongoing motion. As a movement unfolds, the need for predictive
or responsive control to correct for contextual perturbations changes. For example, the early stages of an action
typically exhibit fast responses to perturbations, suggesting the existence of feed-forward processes that use
internal models to predict the sensory consequences. On the other hand, later phases appear to employ
continuous sensory feedback to adjust movements. While much is known about updating for postural and arm
movements, very little is understood about the neural mechanisms of updating of dexterous movements of the
hand as we interact with objects. While the reach-to-grasp cortical anatomy is well described, the causal
functional roles of the regions still remain elusive. In particular, it is now becoming clear that the dominant
framework which describes reach-to-grasp control as being under the control of independent frontoparietal
channels is untenable because it does not explain recent empirical neurophysiological findings. Therefore, the
current project aims to leverage non-invasive stimulation to induce transient cortical perturbations, paired with
visual perturbations to the task goal and mechanical perturbations of the internal state of the limb, to causally
evaluate the contributions of four critical brain regions in components of the reach-to-grasp action. The
information derived from this work will provide a more solid background for our understanding of the functional
organization of the frontoparietal reach-to-grasp network and, by extension, of hand-arm control coordination.
This project will advance our empirical understanding of how dexterous updating of the upper limb, in particular
reach-to-grasp actions, are orchestrated by the brain. The knowledge will be immediately applicable and
translatable for rehabilitation of upper limb recovery in stroke and other similar disorders, by using error
augmentation through visual and haptic platforms to facilitate skill reacquisition and identifying cortical targets
for non-invasive neuromodulatory stimulation. These findings will be relevant to the mission of the NIH, with
broad interest to clinicians and basic scientists, and will have direct

Community-based Design and Evaluation of A Conversational Agent to Promote SARS-
COV2 Vaccination in Black Churches
African Americans have suffered a disproportionate burden from COVID-19, with significantly
higher rates of infection, hospitalization, and mortality compared to Whites. These findings may
be compounded by the fact that African Americans are also at higher risk for vaccine hesitancy.
As limited health literacy has been identified as a key mediator of racial and ethnic disparities,
interventions that address health literacy barriers have the potential to ameliorate these
disparities. Over the past decade we have developed and tested embodied conversational agents
(ECA) — computer characters that simulate face-to-face counseling using voice, hand gesture,
gaze cues and other nonverbal behavior, and successfully used them in health behavior
interventions for populations with low health literacy. We have developed ECA-based
interventions to address a wide range of health problems among low literacy populations,
including physical activity, diet, and medication adherence promotion, providing access to and
explanation of healthcare documents, and collection of family health histories. In this project, we
propose to create an effective and sustainable smartphone-based ECA intervention designed to
deliver personalized and tailored education about SARS-CoV-2 and Influenza vaccination. We
will collaborate with the Black Ministerial Alliance TenPoint (BMATP) of Greater Boston to develop
the intervention app and evaluate it in a clinical trial involving 600 congregants from 12
predominately African American churches. Our primary hypothesis is that participants will have
significantly greater SARS-CoV-2 and Influenza vaccination series completion at 6 months (H1)
and 12 months (H2) in versions of the app that promote engagement and incorporate spiritual
tailoring. Our secondary hypotheses are that, among participants who have not been vaccinated,
those in the high engagement and tailored conditions will have significant improvements in intent
to obtain SARS-CoV-2 and Influenza vaccination and attitudes towards SARS-CoV-2 and
Influenza vaccination.

Mammalian cells expend large amounts of energy into generating enzyme-mediated RNA chemical
modifications that can change the base-pairing, RNA structure, or recruitment of RNA-binding proteins, among
other elusive roles. Pseudouridine (ψ)-modified mRNAs are more thermodynamically stable, more resistant to
RNAse-mediated degradation, and have the potential to modulate immunogenicity and enhance translation in
vivo. However, ψ detection is extremely challenging: ψ modifications do not affect Watson-Crick base pairing
and are indistinguishable from uridine when using hybridization-based methods. Further, since ψ is an isomer
of uridine, detection using mass spectrometry requires non-quantitative chemical derivatization methods. While
recent studies have shown that RNA modifications can be detected through direct RNA nanopore sequencing
by monitoring basecalling errors, we have recently shown that the accuracy and fidelity of this approach is
relatively low and sequence dependent. Our team has recently used a ligation approach to produce synthetic
mRNA controls that contain single ψ sites within relevant transcripts mammalian cells. Using these synthetic
controls we performed nanopore-based RNA sequencing and developed computational tools that increase the
accuracy of ψ-calling to 90+%, depending on the specific sequence. We are basing our work on our recent
finding that achieving ψ quantification requires sequence-specific training using unique signal parameters. The
initial success of our team has laid the foundation to 1) generate an expanded set of barcoded synthetic RNA
constructs that contain single ψ sites, 2) obtain a rigorous set of quadruplicate nanopore runs with ~50,000
single-molecule reads per construct, 3) develop computational tools to allow highly accurate sequence-specific
ψ-calling. We will develop a gold-standard set of synthetic mRNA transcripts as a training molecular set for
quantitative ψ profiling in direct RNA nanopore sequencing of human transcriptomes. The molecular set will
allow quantitative profiling of hundreds of putative ψ sites across mammalian samples.
This proposal will serve an unmet need by addressing a critical bottleneck: the lack of available modified RNA
modification gold standards, i.e., RNA molecules that contain a site-specific and structure-specific modification.
In this collaborative project we will develop a complete pipeline for synthesis of gold standard molecules; use
these molecules to measure the nanopore signals that ψ modifications produce; develop a machine-learning
tool to accurately quantify these modifications; profile site-specific ψ modifications in various cell lines to obtain
ψ-maps that can be used to assess relationships of ψ modifications with phenotypes.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
Binocular vision relies on a synergy between sensory and motor fusional mechanisms that jointly construct a
single percept of the environment from the differing images formed on the two retinae. A stereoscopic sensory
representation of the environment is required for accurate binocular eye movements, which in turn are required
for stereoscopic sensory vision. A failure in either component of this system, especially during development, can
lead to permanent binocular vision impairment. Sensory impairments can include amblyopia, diplopia and
suppression, oculomotor impairments can include strabismus and vergence insufficiency, while socio-economic
sequelae include lost education, sport and job opportunities and elevated adverse health risks. The current
treatments for amblyopia (occlusion and penalization) are primarily monocular and do not promote binocular
perception or eye movement coordination. Similarly, treatments for strabismus do not typically address binocular
perception. These limitations are at least partly due to a lack of practical methodologies for the assessment of
sensory-motor function and partly due to a lack of coordinated sensory-motor therapies.
Recent data show that there is significant plasticity in both sensory systems and motor systems, even in adults.
Many groups are now exploring methods to promote sensory plasticity with digitally modified images in
dichoptic games and movies, but considerably less attention has been directed to motor plasticity or sensory
and motor plasticity together. We hypothesize that additional therapeutic gains and a lower risk of adverse side
effects may be achieved with a combined sensory-motor therapeutic approach that is monitored by effective
sensory-motor endpoints. We argue i) that the pace of commercialization of virtual reality therapies for
anisometropic amblyopia intensifies the need simultaneously to understand sensory and oculomotor deficits in
strabismic amblyopia and ii) that the high levels of recidivism following surgical intervention may benefit from
combined sensorimotor rehabilitation. In Aim 1, we develop and evaluate efficient methods to measure sensory
and motor deficits in people with binocular vision impairment and to provide a quantitative framework for
evidence-based assessment of sensory-motor therapy. In Aim 2, we measure the impact across the visual field
of strabismus on the three-dimensional representation of virtual and natural environments to understand how
the distribution of naturally occurring depth statistics across the visual field may impact the development of
binocular sensory and motor deficits and moderate their response to treatment. In Aim 3, we develop and
evaluate feedback-based methods that aim to facilitate and maintain ocular alignment and examine the
potential benefit of simultaneous sensory and motor interventions for binocular visual function. In each Aim, we
employ both laboratory stimuli, because of their high level of control, and natural and virtual 3D scenes,
because of their rich structure and relevance to real-world deficits. The overall goal is to demonstrate the
theoretical foundation for combined sensory and motor therapeutic approaches to binocular visual dysfunction.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：This proposal addresses fundamental issue of specificity and generality of training in the context of Perceptual
Learning (PL). PL broadly encompasses the set of mechanisms through which experience with the
environment gives rise to changes in perceptual processing. The potential broader impacts of PL are immense.
Careful research in this domain can greatly enhance our basic understanding of the perceptual systems and
the plasticity of these systems. Furthermore, translational approaches underpinned by the basic science of PL
are becoming increasingly prominent. This includes a host of emerging translational approaches for the
rehabilitation of both perceptual deficits and for cognitive training, which are believed to share cortical plasticity
mechanisms. However, while existing research provides evidence that PL approaches can improve perceptual
skills, our ability to develop effective interventions is limited by a lack of understanding of the behavioral
outcomes associated with different PL approaches. Here we suggest that to understand and maximally exploit
PL, it is necessary to know how training with different tasks and in different individuals gives rise to different
outcomes. One major obstacle to successful translation of PL is that the field to-date has been strongly driven
by “novel” and “provocative” findings demonstrated via small N studies with very few projects digging deep to
achieve robust and reliable results. In turn, not surprisingly, the field of PL, like many others in psychology, has
suffered from numerous replication challenges. Furthermore, perhaps because following in direct footsteps
runs counter to the tendencies noted above, it is surprisingly rare for different research groups to use identical
training tasks or outcome tests. This is problematic given research showing that small changes in task-
procedures can give rise to large differences in learning outcome. Here we overcome these limitations by
comparing a large number of different training tasks using common outcome measures and in a large subject
population. Each of these tasks involves a different “critical feature” for learning proposed by a given research
group. However, these tasks have never been directly compared or contrasted. The outcome of the proposed
research will be of tremendous value to both basic understanding of PL as well as how to translate PL to help
those with visual needs. We will achieve robust and reliable results by training a large sample of participants
on PL tasks and assess the outcomes via a common set of measures. We will also collect a broad assessment
of individual differences, which will provide a unique dataset that can resolve controversies in the literature and
lead to new understandings. Our proposed analytical approach tests central key hypothesis in the field,
explores the extent to which different training approaches leads to systematically different profiles of learning,
and examines how these can differ based upon the individuals being trained. Further by releasing our training
and testing tools as well as the data collected, we will enable other groups to model results, replicate our
studies, and make well specified modifications of training tasks with known outcomes to guide future research.

Acute and chronic wildland fire smoke inhalation have been linked to increased mortality as well as respiratory
and cardiovascular morbidity, though the extent to which the frequency and duration of exposure or the
chemical and particle profiles of the smoke contribute to the observed health effects remains unknown. As the
occurrences of wildland fires and number of people living at the wildland urban interface (WUI) continue to
increase, prolonged inhalation of wildland fire smoke poses a serious threat to public health. Due to this, there
is an urgent need to better understand the adverse cardiopulmonary outcomes associated with the exposure to
wildland urban smoke. The smoke that arises from wildland fires at the WUI is a complex mixture of gases,
trace metals, and fine and ultrafine particles. The latter are particularly dangerous for human health, since they
deposit in the deep regions of the lungs and may translocate into the blood stream, increasing the oxidative and
inflammatory burden, both locally and systemically. Prolonged inflammation can lead to the development of
obstructive lung disease and atherosclerosis. To investigate the link between exposure to WUI smoke and
development of cardiopulmonary dysfunction, our interdisciplinary team brings together expertise in fire
generation and characterization, rodent aerosol exposures, respiratory mechanics, lung biology, and
cardiovascular physiology. To fulfill our goals, we will create lab-scale smoke using materials representative of
WUI regions in Southern California and we will deliver it to mice. In Aim 1, we will investigate the role of
frequency and duration of the exposure, as well as particulate concentration of the wildland fire smoke. In Aim
2, we will focus on the relative contribution of different fuel sources characteristic of the WUI. Furthermore, as
part of this ONES early-stage-investigator project, the PI and co-Is will generate an external advisory panel
consisting of inhalation toxicology researchers, public health advocates, and fire protection experts.
Dissemination of new knowledge gained from this proposal to the community will be a vital part of this
endeavor.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
Pediatric feeding disorders are on the rise and are present in 20-50% of typically developing children (1-8) and
in 33-80% of children with developmental delay (9, 10). Furthermore, infants who are born preterm are
particularly at-risk for sucking and feeding difficulties (11, 12). Early non-nutritive suck (NNS) – or sucking
without nutrients being delivered – and feeding skills have been shown to be reliable indicators of central
nervous system (CNS) integrity (18). In fact, delays in sucking and feeding have been reported in
approximately 35-48% of infants with different types of neonatal brain injury (18). Sucking, feeding, speech,
and language all develop in parallel in the first year of life and rely heavily on sensorimotor integration.
However, the link between sucking and feeding skills, CNS function, and development extends beyond the
neonatal period. Emerging retrospective research links neonatal sucking and feeding patterns to subsequent
speech (13) and language (14-17) development in early childhood. Although these behaviors emerge on a
similar timeline and share neural resources and musculature, they are rarely studied together and the links
between them remain unknown. We propose a longitudinal study to sample NNS data at 3, 6, 9, and 12
months of age and speech outcomes at 12, 24, and 36 months of age across full-term (n=85) and moderate to
late preterm (32-37 weeks’ gestational age; n=85) infants. The specific goals of the proposed research are as
follows: (Aim 1) to establish typical patterns of NNS across infants born full-term and preterm in the first year of
life and utilize a functional data analysis to examine infants’ NNS burst waveforms, and (Aim 3) to determine
the ability of NNS to predict subsequent speech development across preterm and full-term infants until age
three. We hypothesize that infant suck will change significantly across the first year of life with infants born
premature performing worse on these measures compared to full-term infants. In addition, we hypothesize that
neonatal suck will predict speech development across preterm and full-term infants. This study provides an
unprecedented level of power in identifying the connection between neonatal sucking and subsequent speech
emergence for several reasons: we will use our (1) innovative, custom and quantitative NNS device to sample
suck across (2) two groups of infants and will (3) utilize functional data analyses to better understand NNS
development and its implications for speech development later in life. (4) We will use standardized and non-
standardized approaches to longitudinally study speech development, which will allow for a more robust and
nuanced understanding of how NNS and speech are connected in infants and children. Overall, this project
captures three years of in-depth oral motor coordination using state-of-the-art methods and collaborators to
answer important theoretical questions. Results generated by this clinically relevant and theoretically driven
study will create a paradigm shift in how clinicians approach feeding and speech therapies in early childhood.

Listeners with hearing impairment can often understand spoken language, but with increased effort, taking
cognitive resources away from other processes such as attention and memory. An important challenge is
therefore to understand how the brain copes with a degraded speech signal and the cognitive processes that
are most critical to successful comprehension. Adult listeners with cochlear implants are a unique group in
which to investigate effortful listening: They have typically adapted to auditory deprivation for a period of years
of profound hearing loss, followed by some degree of hearing restoration following implantation. Following
increased auditory input due to cochlear implantation, the degree to which individual listeners are able to
successfully recognize speech, especially in the presence of background noise, is extremely variable. Previous
attempts to explain this variability in the context of underlying patterns of brain activity have been unsuccessful,
in large part because the technical challenges associated with neuroimaging in the presence of an implanted
medical device have prevented adequate localization of neural responses to speech. The goal of our research
is to understand the cognitive systems that support speech recognition in listeners with cochlear implants and
to use knowledge about these systems to improve behavioral outcomes. We do so using converging evidence
from behavioral measures and functional brain imaging. We make use of high-density diffuse optical
tomography (HD-DOT), a form of optical brain imaging that produces anatomically-localized indices of regional
cortical activity. We will map the brain networks supporting speech comprehension in listeners with cochlear
implants, which we expect to differ from those engaged by listeners with good hearing. We will then evaluate
the degree to which neural markers of effortful listening can predict individual differences in speech recognition
success in the presence of background noise. Together the findings will help ground our understanding of
cochlear implant-aided speech recognition in a neuroanatomically-constrained framework and develop more
accurate outcome measures.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Project Summary
Hematogenous metastasis is responsible for a large majority of cancer-related deaths, where circulating tumor
cells (CTCs) shed from the primary tumor into the peripheral blood (PB). A small number of CTCs may form
secondary sites, which are extremely difficult to control clinically. Most methods for studying CTCs rely on
drawing and analyzing fractionally small PB blood samples (“liquid biopsy”). Although CTCs and multicellular
CTC clusters (CTCCs) have been studied for decades, little is known about their “dynamics” in vivo (transient
changes in their numbers in PB), and how these may affect metastasis development and response to anti-cancer
treatment. For example, it is know that radiation therapy may encourage metastatic dissemination of cancer, yet
the mechanisms for this are still poorly understood.
 Our team recently developed a new method for in vivo enumeration of CTCs in small animals called “diffuse
in vivo flow cytometry” (DiFC). DiFC uses diffuse light to detect fluorescent-protein expressing CTCs in large,
deeply-seated blood vessels. DiFC can sample approximately 100 microliters of blood per minute, permitting
detection of fewer than 1 CTC per mL of PB, and sampling of the entire peripheral blood volume in minutes. We
previously used DiFC to study rare CTC and CTCC dissemination in mouse xenograft models. DiFC revealed
that CTC numbers are highly dynamic and may change by an order-of-magnitude or more over 24 hour periods.
These changes are largely missed by CTC enumeration methods that involve infrequent blood draws.
 The goal of this project is to build a “wearable” tethered w-DiFC instrument that will allow continuous, non-
invasive monitoring of CTC numbers over extended periods in mice. The w-DiFC optical probe and signal
processing design will permit data collection in freely-moving mice in ambient lighting conditions. We will first
use w-DiFC to study CTC dynamics during disease development in an orthotopic xenograft and transgenic mouse
model of metastasis.
 We will use also w-DiFC to measure continuous CTC dynamics after radiation therapy in a medulloblastoma
(MB) mouse model. MB is a common form of childhood brain cancer that aggressively metastasizes to the
leptomeningeal surfaces of the brain and spine via the PB. There is significant evidence that radiation may
exacerbate metastasis by triggering mobilization of CTCs into the blood. We expect that the ability of w-DiFC to
measure CTCs over short-, medium-, and long-term timescales will provide unique insights into this process. We
will also use w-DiFC to study the use of anti-inflammatory drugs to block the pro-metastatic effect. Hence, the
studies proposed here could ultimately lead to better understanding of metastasis and improved treatment
protocols for childhood MB. We anticipate that the unique technologies that will be developed here will have
broad application to other cancers and anti-cancer therapies in the future.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：KRAS is one of the most deadly, yet undrugged, cancer proteins and is present in over 30% of all human
tumors, with even higher frequencies found in pancreatic, lung, thyroid, colon, and liver cancers. Thus, achieving
new mechanistic insights into KRAS deregulation and advancing innovative approaches to neutralize oncogenic
KRAS remain among the highest priorities of the cancer field and represent the focus of this interdisciplinary
proposal. KRAS is a GTPase that serves as a critical control point for a host of cellular functions ranging from
cell survival and proliferation to endocytosis and motility. The functional activity of KRAS is dictated by nucleotide
exchange, with the GTP-bound and GDP-bound forms representing the on and off states, respectively. Cancer
cells hijack and enforce the activated state of KRAS through gain-of-function mutagenesis or gene amplification.
To date, small molecule approaches to directly block the GTP-binding site have been unsuccessful due to
subnanomolar engagement of GTP and GDP by KRAS. The structure of KRAS in complex with SOS1, a guanine
nucleotide exchange factor that enhances KRAS activity by facilitating GDP release, revealed a helix-in-groove
interaction potentially targetable by α-helical mimicry. We applied all-hydrocarbon peptide stapling to generate
stabilized alpha-helices of SOS1 (SAH-SOS1) and identified a prototype compound that engaged oncogenic
KRAS, including the broad diversity of clinical mutants, inhibited the ERK-MAP kinase phosphosignaling cascade
downstream of KRAS, and impaired the viability of KRAS-driven cancer cells. We found that not only did the
prototype SAH-SOS1 construct dissociate the catalytic SOS1/KRAS interaction as anticipated, but also directly
and independently blocked nucleotide association with KRAS by an unknown mechanism. Here, we aim to apply
chemical, structural, cellular, and in vivo approaches to interrogate just how a SAH-SOS1 peptide can directly block
the enzymatic activity of KRAS, compare and contrast this mechanism to the natural agonist activity of the SOS1
protein, and thereby inform both our structure-function understanding of SOS1/KRAS regulation and a new strategy
for therapeutic inhibition of KRAS in human cancer. To achieve these goals, we propose three experimental aims:
(1) Synthesize an expansive library of structurally-reinforced helices modeled after the KRAS-interaction domain
of SOS1 to identify the binding determinants and functional interactions with KRAS and its oncogenic mutants;
(2) Apply hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry to elucidate the conformational effects of the SOS1
protein and SAH-SOS1 peptides on KRAS proteins and thereby define the mechanisms of enzymatic regulation;
(3) Advance optimized SAH-SOS1 inhibitors to cellular and in vivo testing in KRAS-driven cancers to validate
mechanism of action and therapeutic window, and provide proof-of-concept for clinical translation. By combining
the biochemical and mass spectrometry expertise of the Engen laboratory with the cancer chemical biology and
translational approaches of the Walensky laboratory, our goal is to provide new mechanistic insight into the
oncogenic KRAS pathway and inform a new modality to disarm it for therapeutic benefit in cancer.

Evidence suggests that exposure to Superfund chemicals contributes to adverse pregnancy outcomes (APOs),
including preterm birth (PTB). Rates of PTB and infant mortality in Puerto Rico (PR) are among the highest of
all US states and territories. There are 18 Superfund sites in PR, and evidence of contamination of the drinking
water is extensive. Moreover, extreme weather events (hurricanes, flooding) may result in elevated exposures
to Superfund chemicals. The PROTECT center has brought together researchers from Northeastern
University, the University of Puerto Rico, University of Georgia, and the University of Michigan to provide much
needed understanding of the relationship and the mechanisms by which exposure to suspect chemicals
contribute to APOs, and to develop new methods to reduce risk of exposure in PR and beyond. To do this,
PROTECT uses a source-to-outcome structure, integrating epidemiological (Project 1), toxicological (Project
2), fate and transport (Project 3), and remediation (Project 4) studies, a unified sampling infrastructure, a
centralized indexed data repository, and a sophisticated data management system.
Since its inception in 2010, PROTECT has built detailed and extensive data sets on environmental conditions
and prenatal conditions of 1457 pregnant mothers (exposure, socioeconomic and health data–close to 3000
data points per participant), yielding a cohort of 1210 live births in northern PR. In the renewal, PROTECT will
recruit and follow an additional 1000 study participants, yielding a cohort of 800+ live births for an ultimate total
cohort of 2000+ completed live births. PROTECT has documented significant contamination of northern PR
drinking water and has found compelling preliminary epidemiologic and mechanistic toxicology associations
between Superfund chemicals and APOs. PROTECT research has focused on chlorinated volatile organic
compounds and phthalates and their role in PTB. The PROTECT renewal will broaden its scope, employing a
data-driven approach to study and reduce the impact of exposure to mixtures of suspect chemicals
from Superfund sites in karst regions on APOs in Puerto Rico’s underserved, highly-exposed
population. Target chemicals will be expanded to include metals, pesticides, and polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons. We will investigate the impacts of extreme weather events on contaminant transport and
exposure, and new water treatment technologies will be developed for portable and robust water treatment
systems. The PROTECT renewal will also focus on oxidative stress as an underlying biological pathway by
which contaminant exposure can lead to APOs. New statistical methods and data mining, machine learning,
and visualization tools will be developed to allow PROTECT researchers to analyze our datasets. PROTECT
will employ innovative approaches to engage and educate the community, involve study participants, report-
back data, and communicate with stakeholders. A broad suite of training and professional activities will be
provided to trainees, individually tailored to the trainees’ needs and goals.

My long-term career goal is to become an independent pharmacist researcher with expertise in psychiatric
multimorbidity research in cardiovascular disease. Through my research program I aim to identify factors that
influence the health and medication taking behaviors of older adults with psychiatric multimorbidity using “real
world” observational data and direct patient and stakeholder engagement. I have clinical (PharmD) and graduate
(PhD) training in pharmacy and I am an assistant professor at Northeastern University in the Department of
Pharmacy and Health Systems Sciences. Training facilitated by this K01 award will help me achieve my long-
term career goal by building on my clinical and technical skills as a pharmacist and researcher and providing me
with the protected time necessary to expand my expertise in longitudinal data analysis, mixed methods and
patient-centered research in cardiovascular disease and multimorbidity. I have assembled an outstanding,
committed, and interdisciplinary team of nationally renowned experts in fields relevant to the proposed research
and my long-term goals. My training plan complements my prior training and experience and incorporates
interaction with mentors, formal coursework, hands-on training, workshops, conferences and research activities.
Using a mixed methods design, my proposal seeks to build and expand on my preliminary work completed in
partnership with the ongoing NHLBI funded study, Systematic Assessment of Geriatric Elements in Atrial
Fibrillation (SAGE-AF). I will leverage observational data, currently being collected in SAGE-AF, to evaluate the
longitudinal impact of psychiatric multimorbidity (i.e., dyads and the triad of depression, anxiety and cognitive
impairment) on oral anticoagulant (OAC) use and outcomes in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). I will examine
relationships between psychiatric multimorbidity and clinical outcomes such as bleeding and medication
adherence. I will also examine relationships between psychiatric multimorbidity and patient reported outcomes
that are not readily available in the medical record but are increasingly important to patients, their families and
clinicians such as patient satisfaction and health-related quality of life. Then, I will conduct focus groups of SAGE-
AF participants (92% report willingness to continue in SAGE-AF) and stakeholders to understand protective
factors that influence anticoagulation success among patients with psychiatric multimorbidity, including factors
that are not evaluated in the SAGE-AF data. The specific aims are to: 1) Examine the relationship between
psychiatric multimorbidity and OAC prescribing in AF; 2) Among OAC users, examine longitudinal associations
between psychiatric multimorbidity and OAC success indicators and patient reported outcomes over 2 years;
and 3) Conduct 6-8 qualitative focus groups including SAGE-AF participants, their caregivers and their clinicians,
to identify factors that influence OAC success. This proposal aligns with NHLBI’s overarching objective 3 by
investigating factors that account for differences in health among populations and has high potential to identify
factors that can be useful targets for patient-centered interventions.

Title: New Computational Systems Biology Methods for Modeling Gene Regulatory Circuits
One of the biggest challenges in biology is to elucidate complex gene interactions and networks for the purpose
of developing interventions in human disease. Particularly important are those gene networks that control cellular
state transitions (e.g., replicative to quiescent, epithelial to mesenchymal, etc.). Thanks to the emergence of
next-generation sequencing technology, rich data resources are available for mapping gene regulatory
interactions. However, the field still lacks a systems-level understanding of how genes in a network collectively
perform their functions and control cellular state transitions, information that is critical for informed clinical
intervention. The PI’s long-term goal is to design effective computer-aided strategies for predicting therapeutic
interventions by integrating knowledge of gene regulatory networks, genomics data from patients, and systems-
biology model simulations. So far, numerous computational methods have been developed to infer and model
gene regulatory networks. However, they typically suffer from the following issues. First, current approaches are
still ineffective to choose an appropriate set of genes and regulatory interactions in a network to model. Current
approaches infer regulatory relationships based on association of gene expression signals, but generally don't
also consider whether an inferred gene regulatory network can operate as a functional dynamical system driving
expected transitions between the network states. Second, traditional mathematical modeling is hard to be applied
systematically to large systems, because many kinetic parameters are unmeasurable directly from experiments,
especially in vivo. The parameter uncertainty and the potential risk of overfitting in large systems have limited
the predictive power of systems biology. To address these issues, the PI’s research program will develop a suite
of computational systems biology algorithms to construct and model high-quality core regulatory circuits driving
cellular state transitions. We have recently developed enhanced ensemble-based mathematical modeling
algorithms for simulating network behaviors without the need of detailed kinetic parameters. This advance has
allowed an integrated top-down and bottom-up systems-biology modeling, as evident from the PI’s recently
developed network reconstruction and modeling method NetAct and network coarse-graining algorithm
SacoGraci. The PI’s research program will further advance novel technologies of ensemble-based modeling and
their applications to optimize high-quality systems-biology models that capture cellular state transitions. The
algorithms will be benchmarked and refined using in-silico simulated data, publicly available omics data sets,
and data from collaborations, with a focus on cell differentiation in developmental processes and state transitions
in oncogenesis. Success of the research program will result in a comprehensive toolkit that will unveil the gene
regulatory mechanism of cellular state transitions. The algorithmic development is expected to have a broad
impact on not only basic research in systems biology but also shed light on therapeutic intervention in genomic
medicine.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Advances in genome technologies ushered in vast cost reductions in DNA sequencing and increased read
lengths, the latter afforded by development of new single-molecule sequencing technologies. As a result, much
of the genome’s “dark matter” has been elucidated, and higher-quality reference genomes were made available.
In addition to genome sequencing, these single-molecule methods have enabled new applications for probing
chemical modifications in DNA, by either probing the kinetics of sequencing-by-synthesis using optical
waveguides, or by electrically distinguishing modified bases using nanopores.
Despite progress, a critical barrier in genomics is understanding the roles of RNA in biology, which demands
methods for quantitative analysis of RNA molecules in a cell. The myriad of types of RNAs in a cell, their dynamic
chemical modifications, and their elaborate structural and functional diversity, all hint at a tremendous level of
regulation and biological significance. Traditional RNA sequencing methods have primarily relied on conversion
to complementary DNA (cDNA) followed by cDNA sequencing using either high-throughput second-generation
methods or third generation single-molecule methods, the latter of which offers long reads. Using these methods,
some RNA modifications can be read through prior chemical functionalization of the RNA prior to conversion to
cDNA (for example, m6A, pseudouridine, A-to-I editing, 1-methyluridine, and dihydrouridine). However, the
chemical reactions involved in these methods are not 100% quantitative or specific, and further, detection is
often done through incomplete reads due to reverse transcription blocks, which precludes detection of multiple
modifications. The only available method for direct RNA sequencing, the Oxford Nanopore Technologies
platform, suffers from several drawbacks that include high input requirements, limited ability to probe RNA
modifications, and incomplete reads, particularly near the RNA 5’ end.
We address these limitations by developing a new single-molecule method that can be scaled to allow long read
direct RNA sequencing at high throughputs, all with very low input requirements of several picograms. Building
on zero-mode waveguides (ZMWs) originally developed by Pacific Biosciences, we have recently developed
electro-optical ZMWs (eZMWs) that allow low-input capture of DNA and RNA molecules. We demonstrated using
these devices identification of DNA fragments from low inputs by rapid capture of single molecules and their
flash sequencing. Together with the Pyle group, we are developing the integration of MarathonRT, an ultra-
processive reverse transcriptase that converts RNA molecules to cDNA molecules with high processivity and
accuracy, into our electro-optical eZMWs for direct RNA sequencing. We have already fused MarathonRT to a
streptavidin protein and demonstrated its functionality in eZMWs. Here we will build on these developments to
develop a direct RNA sequencing method that can detect single base edits and chemical modifications, all with
high coverage from single-cell inputs of a few pg per run.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Summary
 Injuries to the growth plate (GP) remain a major cause of morbidity in children, often leading to angular
limb deformities and even complete growth arrest. Slipped Capital Femoral Epiphysis (SCFE), a transverse
Salter-Harris type 1 (SH1) fracture, where the spherical femoral head of the hip joint slips backwards off the
femoral neck, is a common and debilitating disorder, affecting the hip in children and adolescents and often
culminating in painful arthritis in adults. A vertical Salter Harris type 2-4 (SH2-4) fracture, in which the fissure
plane extends in the metaphysis or epiphysis, leads to an osseous bridge formation in lieu of cartilage, and
angular deformities. This highlights the need for novel therapeutic strategies to prevent bone formation
at the injury site and to allow epiphyseal cartilage to resume growth. One avenue to promote local
cartilage repair, would be through mobilization of resident stem cells in response to injury. Current literature
describes the GP-RZ as a stem cell-rich region, which give rise to the GP appositionally. We recently
discovered that a population of FoxA2+ long-term stem cells (LTSSC) is located in the top compartment of the
RZ. FoxA2+LTSSC have higher longevity, clonogenicity, and are mutually exclusive with the previously
characterized PTHrP+ short-term stem cells (STSSC), located at the bottom of the RZ.
 A horizontal SH1 injury successfully heals with hyaline cartilage and involves the expansion of FoxA2+
LTSSC. A large vertical SH4 fracture heals through a "bony bar", while a small SH4 lesion heals with hyaline
cartilage. FoxA2+ LTSSC line the outside of a large SH4 wound, but infiltrate the small SH4 lesion. This
suggests other cell types (e.g osteoprogenitors) may create a physical barrier or a signaling niche, which
hinders FoxA2+ LTSSC healing of large defects. In both injuries, a transient pulse of TGFβ signaling, induced
in cartilage remnants at D1, precedes FoxA2+ LTSSC expansion at D3. This indicates a potential role for
TGFβ, in promoting FoxA2+ LTSSC expansion and differentiation into chondrogenic progeny, for cartilage
repair. These findings will allow us to investigate, for the first time, whether FoxA2+LTSSC contribute to GP
cartilage repair following SH1 and SH4 injuries.
 To test this premise, we propose three aims. In Aim 1, we will determine if FoxA2+ cells can contribute
to the repair of a small SH4 lesion, but fail to contribute to the repair of a large SH4 lesion. In Aim 2, we will
determine if TGFβ signaling drives FoxA2+LTSSC migration and differentiation into progeny to accommodate
cartilage repair after SH1 injury. In Aim 3, we will determine if FoxA2+cells transplantation in a large SH4
lesion can prevent formation of a bony bar. Altogether, these results will provide a strong basis for
development of bioengineering strategies for GP cartilage regeneration.

The National Academy of Medicine and the National Institute of Mental Health have described a critical shortage
of child and adolescent psychiatrists (CAPs) who pursue research as a major part of their career. Several efforts
have sought to increase the number of CAP researchers, but the workforce remains insufficient to translate
rapidly emerging genetic, developmental neurobiology, and epidemiology findings into the clinic. We are
determined to improve the yield of researchers for our field by developing an R25-funded research track that is
focused specifically on child and adolescent psychiatry residency. Here, we propose to create the Research
Education in Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (RE-CAP) research track within the NewYork-Presbyterian
Hospital / Weill Cornell / Columbia University / New York State Psychiatric Institute CAP residency, the largest
program in the U.S. With our multiple institution partnership, we are able draw from our two top-ten psychiatry
residency programs, in addition to recruiting promising trainees from across the country. Fulfilling the stated goal
of the NIMH R25 mechanism (PAR-20-094) to “develop, maintain, and expand the interest and ability of
psychiatry residents to conduct research…”, we will provide enhanced exposure to clinical and translational
research in the first year of CAP residency in order to develop and expand interest in research. The R25 funding
will permit a select group of residents to extend their second year of clinical training into two years, while receiving
greater than 50% protected time for research. Intensive mentorship from world-class scientists at Columbia
University or Weill Cornell Medical College will provide them substantial momentum to enter a competitive
postdoctoral research fellowship and sustain a trajectory toward a research career.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Project Summary. Septal-hypothalamic neuronal activity centrally mediates aggressive behavior, while the
monoamine neurotransmitters dopamine and serotonin play strong and mostly opposing modulatory roles.
However, related circuit mechanisms and ontogeny are largely unknown. Making progress towards circuit
mechanism, we found in mice that dopamine input from the ventral tegmental area to the lateral septum is
sufficient for promoting aggression and necessary for establishing baseline aggression. Within the lateral
septum, dopamine acts on D2 receptors to inhibit GABA neurons that project to the hypothalamus. These
findings effectively link the clinically pertinent hyper-dopamine model of aggression with the classic septal-
hypothalamic aggression axis. Making progress towards ontogeny, we identified a sensitive developmental
window during adolescence where dopamine transporter blockade permanently increases adult aggression,
impulsivity, and behavioral stimulant response, and in parallel leads to a hyperactive dopamine system.
Conversely, periadolescent serotonin transporter blockade reduces aggression and behavioral stimulant
response in adulthood, and in parallel leads to a hypoactive dopamine system. Here we will continue this line of
research and study the overarching hypothesis that developmental DA and 5-HT signaling tunes DA input
into the LS and NAc to impact aggression-related behaviors in adulthood. In Aim 1, we investigate the
causal role of dopamine input into the nucleus accumbens in aggression-related behavior. Aggression is
behaviorally classified into reactive aggression which occurs impulsively in response to perceived external threat
and proactive aggression that is premeditated and directly motivated by a drive for appetitive reward. We
hypothesize that nucleus accumbens input contributes to the appetitive value in proactive aggression. In Aim 2,
we test the hypothesis that D2 receptors of the lateral septum contribute to sexual dimorphic differences in
aggressive behavior. We already found D2 receptors mediate dopamine-promoted aggression in male mice as
well as sexual dimorphism for D2 receptor expression. Furthermore, dopamine input into the lateral septum is
not sufficient to trigger aggression in females. In Aim 3, we investigate the causal role of serotonin input into the
lateral septum and nucleus accumbens in aggression-related behavior. Finally, in Aim 4, we investigate if
permanently altered DAergic input into the LS and NAc drives the aggression phenotypes after dopamine and
serotonin transporter blockade during development, by monitoring pathway-specific dopaminergic activity during
behavior, paired with optogenetic rescue experiments. By mapping circuits to behavior in the context of sensitive
developmental period interference, we will advance our understanding of normal as well as disrupted brain
development and function. Such information will impact the understanding of human risk factors for maladaptive
aggression and dopamine dysfunction. With the novel mechanistic and translational insight, we seek to inform
clinical and epidemiological studies and improve diagnosis, prevention and treatment strategies for in psychiatry.

 Obesity and the associated metabolic complications including metabolic syndrome and diabetes significantly contribute
to cardiovascular morbidities. The overall goal of this proposal is aimed at identifying cellular mechanisms that link
activation of the G-protein coupled receptor 75 (GPR75) to obesity-driven metabolic and cardiovascular complications. In
the last funding period, we provided strong evidence that GPR75 is the receptor to which 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid
(20-HETE), a vasoactive and pro-inflammatory lipid mediator, binds and through which it triggers its actions. 20-HETE
has been implicated in the development and progression of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases including hypertension,
stroke, myocardial infarction, diabetes and metabolic syndrome. Our recent studies clearly demonstrated that 20-HETE-
mediates vascular dysfunction in hypertension and diet-driven metabolic (e.g., insulin resistance) and cardiovascular (e.g.,
hypertension) complications through its pairing and activation of GPR75. The adipose tissue and the vascular endothelium
are key to the ensuing cardiometabolic disorders in obesity. They both express GPR75 and are prime targets for 20-HETE
bioactions. In the endothelium, 20-HETE, through its binding to GPR75, uncouples eNOS, induces ACE and activates the
NF-κB inflammatory program. 20-HETE stimulates adipocyte hypertrophy and interferes with adipocyte insulin signaling,
glucose homeostasis and mitochondria function. Endothelial dysfunction in hypertensive subjects and obesity in humans
and animal models are accompanied by several fold increases in circulating 20-HETE levels. Accordingly, it is reasonable
to assume that 20-HETE through its actions on the vascular endothelium and adipose tissue acts as a significant determinant
of obesity-driven cardiovascular and metabolic complications. Importantly, in a large-scale exome sequencing of ~600,000
individuals, we revealed that loss of function GPR75 variants are associated with leanness and protection from obesity
(Science, 2021). This finding, which has been validated in Gpr75 null mice (Science, 2021 and Preliminary Results),
compellingly implicates the 20-HETE-GPR75 pairing in the pathogenesis of obesity and its cardiometabolic complications
and calls for identification of the underlying mechanisms. Consequently, we hypothesized that 20-HETE-GPR75 pairing
promotes diet-driven cardiometabolic complications (e.g., hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, hypertension) by a
mechanism that impairs endothelial and adipocyte function. We further argue that 20-HETE-GPR75 pairing
governs a crosstalk between adipocytes and endothelial cells which contributes to cardiovascular and metabolic
complications in obesity. This hypothesis will be tested in three specific aims that assess the contribution of endothelial-
and adipocyte-specific Gpr75 to diet-driven obesity and examine potential mechanisms governing endothelial-adipocyte
crosstalk that are dependent on 20-HETE-GPR75 pairing.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in the U.S., with the annual total cost of care
estimated at $351 billion. Vascular calcification is a nontraditional CVD risk factor associated with a significant
increase in morbidity and mortality in the general population. Unlike other established risk factors, it is not yet
regarded as a modifiable factor. However, there is emerging evidence that it may drive the pathogenesis of
atherosclerosis and play an important role in the regression of atherosclerotic plaques. Our data demonstrated
that overexpression of tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNAP) in endothelial cells accelerated
coronary atherosclerosis in hyperlipidemic mice, while the TNAP inhibitor SBI-425 reduced manifestations of
coronary artery disease in this model. Subendothelial microcalcification was frequently observed in the internal
elastic lamina in mice and in human arteries and was predicted by computational fluid structure interaction
(FSI) modeling to redistribute wall shear stress on the endothelium. The idea that calcification can promote
atherosclerosis was further supported by an observation of increased low density lipoprotein (LDL) uptake by
endothelial cells cultured on surfaces textured with hydroxyapatite particles. More evidence from mouse
models showed that TNAP activity in macrophages was sufficient to increase calcification during progression
of atherosclerosis and interfere with plaque regression, leading to maladaptive dilation of the aortic root.
We hypothesize that calcification is a modifiable factor in atherosclerosis and that inhibiting TNAP-mediated
vascular calcification may have therapeutic value. The overarching goal of this project is to gain a better
understanding of the role of calcification during atherosclerotic lesion initiation, progression, and resolution,
and to determine whether calcification is an active pathogenic factor in atherosclerosis or a mere, likely benign,
secondary response. The project will use computational and in vivo models to delineate hemodynamic
mechanism by which subendothelial microcalcifications increases retention of LDL in the arterial wall. The
effects of the conditional genetic ablation of TNAP in macrophages or an increase of TNAP activity in plasma
will then be tested in a mouse model of familial hypercholesterolemia. Because regression of calcified plaques
can lead to eccentric aortic root remodeling during lipid lowering, we will interrogate whether inhibition of TNAP
with SBI-425 could suppress calcification and alleviate maladaptive remodeling of the aortic root in a mouse
model during reversal of atherosclerosis. In testing TNAP inhibition for its therapeutic utility for atherosclerotic
calcification, we will keep close attention on potential bone side effects by monitoring bone microarchitecture
using micro-computed tomography. The results of this project will establish whether calcification is a
modifiable risk factor in CVD and determine whether systemic TNAP inhibition or elimination of
osteogenic TNAP-expressing macrophages is a viable therapeutic approach in atherosclerosis. The
results of this study will help guide future development of novel therapeutics for this prevalent disease.

An RNA sequence with all its diverse modifications constitutes ‘true’ information content of the RNA. Defects in
RNA modifications account for >100 human diseases, such as breast cancer, type-2 diabetes and obesity,
affecting millions of Americans. Despite its significance, the true sequence of a RNA, i.e., identity and location
of each and every nucleotide building block (modified or not) within a full-length RNA, remains a mystery, mainly
because of the lack of a general method to directly sequence any nucleotide, especially modified nucleotides
(including unknown ones) at single-nucleotide resolution. No existing technology can sequence all modifications
simultaneously to unfold the true RNA sequences at a large scale or the transcriptomic level.
 What complicates RNA modification studies is that >170 modification types have been discovered, and
not all of nucleotide modifications are modified completely to 100% at their RNA sites. They are even
undetectable by NGS-based technologies, which require the conversion of RNA to cDNAs that do not have any
modification information. Tools to map RNA modifications are limited only to a few popular modifications, and
can usually analyze only one modification type at a time. Mass spectrometry (MS) is currently the only technique
that can characterize all RNA modifications; however, conventional MS methods lose information regarding the
location and co-occurrence of modified nucleotides.
 To resolve these outstanding issues, we have recently developed a series of novel next generation mass
spectrometry-based sequencing (NextGen MassSpec-Seq) approaches that can de novo directly sequence
tRNAs without a cDNA and can sequence and quantify all nucleotide modifications simultaneously. For the
duration of this proposal, we will further develop NextGen MassSpec-Seq to sequence tRNAs efficiently in
different cellular and even disease conditions, make it scalable toward high throughput, and expand its
application to simultaneously sequence and map all modifications quantitatively on any RNA type and at the
transcriptomic level. Specifically, we propose to develop MS for large-scale de novo sequencing of full-length
tRNAs, together with all diverse nucleotide modifications (Aim 1), empower MS to simultaneously sequence and
quantify multiple RNA modifications, allowing quantitative mapping at single nucleotide and stoichiometric
precision (Aim 2), scale up NextGen MassSpec-Seq and combine it with high-throughput NGS sequencing for
direct sequencing of diverse RNA modifications at the transcriptomic level (Aim 3). Our tool will address a long-
standing issue of how to reveal the ‘true” RNA sequences and provide a transformative tool for studying RNA
modifications, which will promote better understanding of functions of post-transcriptional modifications and their
correlations to RNA-related diseases and pandemics.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Vascular diseases continue to be a major cause of death in the US and worldwide. It has been proposed that metabolic
reprogramming and increased glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) activity and expression contribute to the
pathogenesis of fatal angioproliferative vasculopathies. Moreover, some studies suggest individuals with a loss-of-
function G6PD (Mediterranean or African) variant – S188F (G6PDS188F; Type A-; severe deficiency) or N126D
(G6PDN126D; Type A; mild deficiency) nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphism – have lower frequencies of
coronary artery disease. However, G6PD-driven pathogenic and G6PD variant-associated protective mechanisms
affecting vascular diseases remain elusive. We therefore propose to determine potential mechanisms, driven by a newly
discovered G6PD isoform in the nucleus of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), that contribute to pathogenic large
artery stiffness and remodeling. Based on strongly supporting preliminary results, we hypothesized that nuclear G6PD
is a modulator of epigenetic modifiers and is a transcription regulator in VSMCs. Consequently, the loss-of-function
G6PD (S188F, N126D) variants block maladaptive modifications of the epigenome, reducing large artery elastance and
remodeling elicited by obesity/metabolic syndrome and balloon-injury. We will test this hypothesis in three specific
aims. In Aim 1, we will test the hypothesis that G6PD and/or G6PD-coordinated redox in the nucleus controls the
expression and activity of epigenetic modifiers (DNA methyltransferases (DNMT) and DNA (TET) and histone
(JARID) demethylases) and transcription of genes that encode proteins involved in regulating the differentiation
(contractile) and dedifferentiation (pro-inflammatory, -thrombotic, and -proliferative) phenotypes in VSMCs. In Aim 2,
we will determine whether loss-of-function G6PD variants detach from epigenetic modifiers to increase DNA
methylation, suppress histone3-lysine4 trimethylation, and reduce transcription of genes that confer maladaptive (pro-
inflammatory, -thrombotic, and -proliferative) properties to VSMCs. In Aim 3, we will determine whether G6PD variant
rats express fewer maladaptive epigenetic (histone3-lysine4 trimethylation) changes and develop less large artery
elastance (stiffness) and vascular remodeling than wild-type rats fed a high-fat diet (a model of obesity/metabolic
syndrome) or subjected to carotid artery balloon-injury. The results from gain-of-function and loss-of-function studies
of this project will reveal the direct effect of G6PD on gene expression associated with pathogenic vascular remodeling
and large artery stiffness, which lead to heart failure and death. We foresee two significant impacts on vascular biology:
[1] linkage of heretofore unknown G6PD-dependent subcellular redox in the nucleus directly to the fundamental
transcriptional mechanics and gene transcription in vascular pathobiology and [2] development of new treatments
targeting redox signaling to reduce large artery stiffness and remodeling.

The initial contact between newly transmitted group A streptococci (GAS) and its human host can be readily
thwarted by antibody (Ab) directed to the appropriate GAS antigens (Ags). To best simulate this
microenvironment, physiological (i.e., low) inoculum doses of GAS are essential. The goal of this proposal is to
identify Ags, alone and in combinations representing multicomponent vaccines, that are the most effective
targets of Ab-mediated immunity and collectively can provide worldwide coverage against all GAS strains.
The underlying rationale for the proposed approach rests on two principles: That serum obtained from children
just prior to a new GAS infection lacks protective Ab, and that serum obtained from most adults has at least
low levels of persisting protective Ab. The latter is based on the very low incidence of GAS infection in adults,
likely the result of protective immunity that developed following repeated infections earlier in life. Hypotheses
on protective Ag-specific Ab generated from analysis of pediatric serum (aim 1) are experimentally tested in
mice (aim 2). Pre-infection pediatric serum is analyzed for lack of protective Ab to leading vaccine candidates.
Adult serum is used as a source for purified immunoglobulin (Ig) specific to the vaccine target Ags missing in
susceptible children. Immunodeficient mice are passively immunized with the Ag-specific Ig purified from adults
and challenged with low infective doses of GAS. The Ag-specific Ig that confers protection in mice equates to a
human serum-based correlate of protection (CoP).
Four major forms of GAS disease are modeled in mice and evaluated for protective immunity: upper
respiratory tract infection, impetigo, skin and soft tissue infection and invasive disease. GAS from all three
major subpopulations of strains are tested: throat specialists, skin specialists and generalists. The Ag targets
evaluated are leading vaccine candidates and include broadly and semi-conserved Ags as well as surface and
secreted Ags. If successful, this work will identify a collection of Ag targets that can serve as the basis for
global protection. It will also deliver two new standardized platforms – screening of pre-infection human serum
Ab to GAS Ags and improved mouse models - for future identification and straightforward comparison of
additional GAS vaccine candidates.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Adolescence is a window of vulnerability for the development of schizophrenia and other mental disorders. In
schizophrenia, imaging studies have found that thalamo-prefrontal resting state connectivity is reduced during
adolescence prior to disease onset. This decrease in functional connectivity has been linked to cognitive
symptoms and the etiology of the disorder. For many years, an altered maturation of the prefrontal cortex (PFC)
has been implicated in the cognitive deficits of mental disorders yet the mechanisms that drive PFC maturation
are largely unknown. Because thalamic input activity is important for circuit maturation in sensory cortices, we
hypothesize here that thalamic input activity is also important for prefrontal circuit maturation.
To address whether adolescence is a sensitive time-period during which thalamic activity regulates the
maturation of PFC circuitry, we used mice and compared the effects of reducing activity in the thalamic nuclei
projecting to the PFC during postnatal days P20-50 with that in adulthood (P90-120). We found that inhibiting
the thalamus during adolescence leads to a long-lasting decrease in the density of thalamo-mPFC projections
and a reduced excitatory drive to mPFC neurons. Adolescent thalamic inhibition further causes cognitive deficits
in attentional set shifting during adulthood that are associated with disrupted correlated neuronal activity and
task outcome encoding in the mPFC. In contrast, thalamic inhibition during adulthood has no long-lasting
consequences on mPFC excitation, correlated activity, outcome encoding and behavior. Strikingly, exciting the
thalamus in adulthood during the set shifting task rescues in vivo neuronal activity and cognitive deficits induced
by adolescent inhibition.
While these data point to adolescence as a sensitive time window for PFC circuit maturation the underlying
mechanisms by which adolescent inhibition impairs mPFC maturation are still unclear. To address this, first, the
development of mPFC circuitry needs to be characterized during adolescence. Second, it will be important to
determine whether adolescent inhibition induces long-lasting changes in intrinsic mPFC circuitry, and which
specific mPFC projections and interneurons are regulated by adolescent thalamic inhibition. Third, it will be
important to know when such changes arise and how they relate to the changes in in vivo cross correlated activity
and outcome encoding. Our data further suggest that boosting thalamic activity could provide a strategy for
rescuing cognitive deficits in neurodevelopmental disorders. However, as presented, the beneficial effect only
occurs while the thalamus is stimulated. Therefore, strategies will need to be identified that allow for a longer
lasting rescue of the cognitive abilities. We will address these questions using three aims: Aim 1: To determine
when and where adolescent thalamic activity regulates the development of mPFC circuit connectivity. Aim 2: To
determine whether the impact of adolescent thalamic inhibition on cognition requires maturation of the mPFC.
Aim 3. To determine whether thalamic excitation can lead to a long-lasting rescue of the cognitive deficit.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
Cognitive flexibility allows an individual to adapt established thinking patterns and behavioral responses to novel
situations that may require new approaches than those that were previously learned in order to be solved
correctly. Cognitive flexibility is therefore necessary to flexibly adjust ones thinking and behavior instead of
ruminating over thoughts and worries, or instead of showing habitual behavior that may not be productive to
effectively engage with a new situation or to solve a new problem. Impairments in cognitive flexibility can occur
as a result of chronic stress, which is a major contributor to the pathogenesis of many psychiatric disorders.
Accordingly, cognitive flexibility deficits are common across a wide range of mental illnesses and often
unresponsive to otherwise effective medication. Moreover, individuals with high levels of cognitive flexibility have
been shown to cope better with day-to-day stressors, and to be less vulnerable to developing psychiatric
disorders. If we can understand the neural circuits underlying cognitive flexibility, we may be able to identify new
targets for advanced therapeutics to treat the debilitating cognitive impairments of many psychiatric disorders.
In this proposal, we will study a novel neural circuit component underlying one important form of cognitive
flexibility: reversal learning. We will specifically investigate how neural projections from the ventral hippocampus
to the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) regulate reversal learning and stress resilience. In Aim 1, we will inhibit direct
input projections from the ventral hippocampus to the medial OFC, and output projections from the medial OFC
to the lateral OFC, to test if this circuit is functionally important for reversal learning. In Aim 2, we will use in vivo
Ca2+ imaging of neural activity in ventral hippocampus, medial OFC, and lateral OFC, to examine for the first
time how neurons in these brain regions store, process, and update information about action-outcome value
associations that are important for reversal learning. In Aim 3, we will then investigate how these same brain
regions become dysfunctional under conditions of chronic stress, and if stimulating this circuitry can confer stress
resilience and counteract stress-induced deficits in reversal learning. Together, these experiments will provide
first insight into a new element of the neural circuitry underlying cognitive flexibility and stress resilience, which
has great potential to reveal new neural circuit-based targets for novel drugs or for advanced cognitive-behavioral
therapies aimed at improving cognitive flexibility in patients suffering from psychiatric disorders.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：The aim of the current proposal is to test the hypothesis that signaling through 5-HT1A
receptors in the medial prefrontal cortex during adolescence is important for establishing
lifelong motivation. Prior work suggests that disruption of the serotonin system during
early post-natal development in animal models results in altered anxiety and mood
related behaviors in the full-grown adult animal. One receptor that is particularly relevant
in this regard is the 5-HT1A receptor. Recent data from our lab suggests that loss of
serotonin signaling through 5-HT1A receptors in the medial prefrontal cortex during
adolescence but not during adulthood, results in decreased motivation related behavioral
setpoints. We hypothesize that this is true for both appetitive and avoidance motivation.
The current proposal both examines mechanisms through which altered serotonin
signaling through 5-HT1A receptors in adolescence leads to changes in motivation and
further elucidates the specific nature of the reinforcement related behavior that is
affected. In addition to a loss of function, we will use a biased 5-HT1A agonist as a gain
of function approach bi-directionally modulate 5-HT1A signaling Using slice physiology,
we will assess whether 5-HT1A expressing neurons alter their intrinsic properties as a
result of the disrupted 5-HT1A mediated signaling, or whether there are compensatory
changes in circuit properties resulting from the disruption. Using fiber photometry, we
will determine how the medial prefrontal cortex engages with other circuit nodes like the
dorsal raphe nucleus in tasks that tax motivational systems, with the goal of
understanding the circuit basis for the disrupted behavior. Finally, we will directly
assess whether the sensitivity of mPFC pyramidal neurons to inputs during adolescence
is the critical factor in establishing later motivation. We will do this by manipulating
mPFC principal neuron activity during the sensitive period in adolescence using
DREADDS. Understanding how mPFC plasticity in adolescence can be harnessed to
modulate motivation is a potentially promising strategy for addressing disorder that
emerge in adolescence and often include a prominent motivational component.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Overgeneralization is a cognitive impairment commonly associated with post-traumatic stress
disorder as well as mood and anxiety disorders. Over the past 10 years of this grant, we have
accumulated several lines of evidence indicating that the dentate gyrus (DG) contributes to a
range of negative valence related behaviors including fear overgeneralization, as well as to some
of the behavioral effects of antidepressant medications. Specifically, we and others have shown
that the dentate gyrus is critical for contextual fear discrimination learning, a form a
learning that has been proposed to be mediated by pattern separation, a computational
process by which similar experiences are transformed into discrete non-overlapping neural
representations. In the current proposal we aim at bringing together these behavioral and
physiological lines of research by showing that the DG is critical for pattern separation and that
deficits in pattern separation underlie the contextual discrimination deficits often observed in mood
and anxiety disorders. Based on our preliminary results we hypothesize that strategies aimed
at improving pattern separation in the DG will be beneficial for the treatment of mood and
anxiety disorders.
Unlike most other brain regions, the adult DG contains not only mature developmentally-born
neurons but also adult-born neurons generated via a process termed adult neurogenesis. We
and others have shown that both mature granule cells (mGCs) and young adult-born granule cells
(abGCs) are critical for contextual fear discrimination learning (CFD). In the proposed studies we
will image the activity of both abGCs as well as mGCs in the DG during a contextual fear
discrimination task by using calcium imaging and miniature microscopes (miniscopes).
This imaging will be done in baseline conditions (Aim 1), after optogenetic manipulation of abGCs
to modulate DG activity (Aim 2), and after early life stress and adult manipulations of DG activity
(Aim 3).

This project is responsive to NOT-MD-19-001 Notice of Special Interest in Research on the Health of Sexual and
Gender Minority (SGM) Populations. Gender minority populations are at increased risk for cardiovascular
disease (CVD) morbidity and mortality. Specifically, Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System data suggest
that, compared to cisgender people, gender minorities are at more than double the risk for myocardial infarction
and report greater depression, physical inactivity, and elevated body mass index (BMI), as well as poorer access
to healthcare, all of which increase CVD risk. Further, many gender minority individuals take hormones, which
may further increase their risk of CVD. According to minority stress theory, the negative impact of prejudice and
discrimination is one contributor to CVD risk disparities. Although previous studies have found associations
between gender minority stress and poorer self-reported mental health, the impact of minority stress on physical
health outcomes, including CVD risk, has not been examined in gender minority populations. The goal of this
study is to advance our understanding of how minority stress and resilience affect CVD risk. In an established
longitudinal, multisite cohort of gender minority individuals in three U.S. cities (N=390), we aim to: (1)
determine the association of minority stress with mental health and CVD risk; (2) determine the impact of social
support, access to care, and identity development on mental health and CVD risk; and (3) identify modifiable
resilience factors that may influence the relationship of minority stress to mental health and CVD risk in this
health disparity population. In addition to structured interviews and Ecological Momentary Assessments (EMA)
of stress and resilience at baseline and 2-year follow-up, we will collect 2-week bursts of objective measurements
of blood pressure, sleep and physical activity. The proposed research will provide the best evidence to date to
guide researchers and clinicians working to develop interventions to reduce CVD disparities in gender minority
populations, and promote their long-term health and wellbeing.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：In this re-submitted application, we seek to evaluate maternal biomarkers of oxidative stress in relation to
schizophrenia (SZ) and autism spectrum disorders (ASD) in offspring, their relationships with one another, and
with other environmental exposures during development. The proposal is based on the Finnish Prenatal
Studies of Schizophrenia (FiPS-S), and Autism (FiPS-A), the largest seroepidemiologic studies of prenatal
exposures in these disorders to date, and the first to utilize a national birth cohort. This nested case-control
study draws on the Finnish Maternity Cohort (FMC), which consists of virtually all pregnancies in Finland from
1987-2017; the total sample size is approximately 1 million. Maternal prenatal serum samples were obtained
and archived from each gravida, and the Finnish psychiatric registries contain validated diagnoses of SZ and
ASD on virtually all hospitalized and non-hospitalized cases in Finland. We have identified large samples of
SZ and ASD case and control offspring and demonstrated relationships between several prenatal biomarkers
and these disorders in this cohort. Although maternal oxidative stress causes abnormal fetal development, is
associated with developmental insults, and leads to brain and behavioral abnormalities concordant with SZ and
ASD, no previous study has ever examined relationships between this prenatal factor and psychiatric
diagnostic outcomes in offspring. We aim to address the role of maternal exposure to oxidative stress and
these disorders by assays of maternal serum specimens in pregnancies from large samples of case and
matched control offspring. We will test the hypothesis that maternal biomarkers of the antioxidant defense
system are negatively associated with SZ and ASD in offspring and a pro-oxidant biomarker is positively
associated with these outcomes. We will also evaluate whether correlations observed between these maternal
biomarkers in control offspring are disrupted in SZ and ASD offspring. Moreover, we shall assess whether sex
and perinatal complications modify relationships between maternal oxidative stress biomarkers and SZ/ASD.
For this purpose, maternal serum samples from SZ and ASD cases and matched controls will be analyzed for
biomarkers of oxidative stress. This research has the potential to result in a better understanding of prenatal
risk factors for SZ and ASD. Since oxidative stress is a common pathogenic mechanism that is caused by
several types of environmental insults which have been implicated in these disorders, the study offers the
potential for their prevention by reducing these exposures and may suggest new pathogenic mechanisms in
future translational studies. In summary, the proposed work builds on an existing national birth cohort, and is
anticipated to impact an emerging and potentially transformative area of research epidemiology and
clinical/basic neuroscience, leading to improvements in public health policy.

Addictive psychostimulants such as amphetamine act at dopamine synapses in the striatum. Presynaptic
amphetamine action drives dopamine release via activity-dependent and activity-independent mechanisms.
Dopamine acts on multiple dopamine receptors that are differentially distributed on striatal neurons. Beyond
this volume transmission, dopamine neurons engage in synaptic transmission that is operative on a fast time
scale, compared to volume transmission, and involves not only dopamine, but also GABA and glutamate. This
project focuses on these synaptic connections as a novel substrate for psychostimulant action. The synaptic
transmission exerts excitatory effects through dopamine D1 receptors, ionotropic and metabotropic glutamate
receptors, and inhibitory effects through dopamine D2 receptors and GABAA receptors. While dopaminergic
and GABAergic synaptic connections are widespread, glutamatergic connections are concentrated in the
medial nucleus accumbens and the anterior lateral dorsal striatum. Synaptic connections to cholinergic
interneurons are the strongest, most complex, involving dopamine, GABA and glutamate. Remarkably
glutamate cotransmission is abrogated by amphetamine administration, and abrogation of glutamate
cotransmission attenuates psychostimulant responsiveness. The guiding hypothesis is that amphetamine-
induced plasticity of a subset of dopamine neuron synapses is critical for driving the striatal circuitry towards
the addicted state, particularly dopamine neuron synapses distinguished by glutamate cotransmission. The
three specific aims are to: <1> Determine quantitatively amphetamine-induced plasticity of dopamine neuron
synaptic connections to cholinergic interneurons in striatal subregions identified by synaptic connectivity-based
clustering. <2> Determine direct synaptic effects of amphetamine on dopamine neuron synaptic transmission
in striatal subregions distinguished by glutamate cotransmission. <3> Determine amphetamine effects on
dopamine neuron terminal activity during amphetamine-induced behaviors. This project will advance
understanding of the synaptic substrate of amphetamine action in the striatum, revealing loci of drug-induced
plasticity that will inform the pharmacotherapy of addiction.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：The hippocampus neurogenic niche (HNN) generates new neurons in mammals, but it is unclear if this is
happening in humans. Adult hippocampal neurogenesis is necessary to maintain intact cognitive and emotional
functions regulated by the hippocampus. Markers of immaturity have been detected in neuronal cells of the HNN
but it is still unclear if they represent adult-born neurons, or neuronal cells that have maintained their immaturity
since birth. We found that the number of neural progenitor cells (NPCs) and immature neurons was stable
throughout the eighth decade of life in normal aging (NA) subjects, but angiogenesis and neuroplasticity were
decreased in older people. Other groups have supported our findings, while some could not detect immature
neuronal cells in human hippocampus. Moreover, in aging mice, more NPCs differentiate into glia rather than
neurons, compared to younger animals, but we do not know if this happens in humans. Adult neurogenesis is
lower in Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) and it is unknown if this is because more NPCs differentiate into glia or through
other mechanisms. These gaps in knowledge warrant the use of new technologies to investigate cellular lineages
in the human HNN, and molecular regulators of NPCs proliferation, cell fate, differentiation, maturation and
survival. This project aims to identify differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) and genes (DEGs) in the human
HNN, at the regional and single cell level, comparing NA and AD. We will apply our pipeline using high resolution
mass spectrometry for proteomics analysis, and single nuclei (sn) RNA and ATAC (Assay for Transposase-
Accessible Chromatin) sequencing (seq), to identify gene expression and epigenetic changes. In slide-mounted
hippocampus tissue, we will apply Visium (10X Genomics) and our custom-made spatial transcriptomic
technology for anatomical co-mapping of cell-type specific mRNAs and proteins (DBiT-seq). Novel computational
approaches will identify neurogenesis regulators in the human HNN that can be tested in cellular or animal
models. Findings obtained with these “OMICS” approaches will be validated using HighPlex RNAscope®
(ADCBio) and immunofluorescence, and qPCR, Western blots, and ELISA assays, to visualize and quantify DEP
and DEG expression at the single cell and regional level. Our rigorous brain collection methods assure tissue
quality, uniform processing, use of toxicology and neuropathology, and strict clinical inclusion/exclusion criteria.
Groups include: NA subjects (N=100), Braak stage 0-1, age 14-99 yrs., 40 of which (60 years of age and older)
are matched (by age, sex and postmortem interval between death and brain collection) with 40 AD cases (from
the Columbia Taub Institute collection), Braak stage 1 through 4. Aims: 1. Identify HNN DEPs associated with
NA and AD. 2. Identify DEGs in immature and mature neuronal and glial cell populations of the DG in NA and
AD subjects, using sn-RNA and sn-ATAC-seq (10X Genomics). 3. Determine the anatomical localization of cell
expressing DEGs and DEPs associated with NA and AD, using Visium and DBiT-seq. 4. Test correlations
between DEPs and DEGs, and numbers of NPCs and immature neurons and glia in NA and AD.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：There are substantial inter-individual differences in biological aging trajectories, but the origin of these
differences is unclear. One specific cellular component that sustains life and fuels stress adaptation are
mitochondria, which contain their own genome and generate metabolic intermediates necessary for epigenetic
modifications. As a result, genetic defects in mitochondria shorten lifespan in both animal models and patients
with mtDNA defects, possibly via the influence of mitochondrial signaling on gene expression and the
epigenetic machinery, which includes DNA methylation (DNAm). Reliable changes in DNAm occur with
advancing age at specific genomic locations, which have been captured and integrated in predictive algorithms
called epigenetic clocks. These clocks predict DNAmAge and have been validated and meta-analyzed in large
human cohorts demonstrating that DNAmAge predicts mortality and age-related diseases. But little is known
about what clocks actually measure (i.e., what makes them tick), and about their modifiability by metabolic
factors across the lifespan. To map the life-long behavior of epigenetic clocks and their responses to both
stress mediators and mitochondrial dysfunction, we have developed a primary human fibroblasts cellular
lifespan model where: i) DNAm signatures of aging are conserved, ii) the rate of DNAm aging is accelerated
about 70 times relative to the human body, iii) metabolic and mitochondrial dysfunction reduces lifespan (i.e.,
the Hayflick limit) by 25-50%, and iv) other aging biomarkers including ccf-mtDNA and the pro-inflammatory
cytokine IL6 are also progressively induced across the cellular lifespan. In Aim 1, we will characterize DNAm
aging trajectories across the entire cellular lifespan in both female and male cells using four different global
DNAmAge algorithms, a gene-based approach, and by modeling single-CpG trajectories. There results will be
validated and extended into available human aging cohorts. In Aim 2, we will examine the modifiability of
DNAm clocks with two interventions that reliably decrease the Hayflick limit: i) we will use converging
pharmacological and genetic approaches to induce specific mitochondrial respiratory defects, and ii) expose
cells to chronic glucocorticoid stimulation to recapitulate the effects of chronic psychosocial stress known to
accelerate biological aging in humans. In the final aim, we will perform studies to understand how clock-based
DNAmAge relate to other validated aging biomarkers including the expression of age-related genes (Elovl2,
p16INK4a), telomere length, circulating cell-free mtDNA (ccf-mtDNA), and the inflammatory cytokine IL-6.
Moreover, additional experiments will be performed to establish the contribution of cell division to epigenetic
age acceleration, the role of ambient oxygen, and to test the effect of a DNA demethylation agent on other
aging biomarkers and on lifespan. Overall, these studies will uncover novel longitudinal associations between
epigenetic clocks and human aging biomarkers, and establish the role of mitochondrial signaling as a driver of
cellular aging in a human system.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Alzheimer's disease (AD), as well as normal aging, are associated with a wide range of brain
and cognitive changes. In investigating cognitive changes, it has been observed that some
people can sustain more brain changes or pathology than others, and this differential
susceptibility is related to measures such as IQ, education, vocational experiences etc. This
observation is the basis for the cognitive reserve (CR) hypothesis, where CR moderates the
effects of brain changes on cognition. Recent developments in medical imaging, particularly
multimodal neuroimaging, can provide better understanding of neural mechanisms that underlie
both cognitive changes and the role of CR. However, existing statistical methods were not
designed to accommodate large-scale multi-dimensional data, particularly for incorporating
high-dimensional moderators and mediators. To address these issues, we propose to develop,
validate, and apply software tools for the cross-sectional and longitudinal analysis of multimodal
MR brain images and cognitive data acquired from individuals with normal cognitive aging,
preclinical AD and AD from two independent studies of aging and Alzheimer's disease: the
Reference Ability Neural Networks (RANN) (Yaakov Stern, PI) and the Alzheimer's Disease
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). We will demonstrate that the developed statistical methods offer
improved accuracy and robustness over current tools. First, we will develop tools for identifying
robust relationships between neurodegeneration or pathology markers and brain function
(network expression measured by task fMRI) in the presence of CR as a moderator. Second,
we will derive neural substrate of CR using resting-state functional MRI and task fMRI and then
develop statistical tools to test the moderation effect of the imaging CR proxies. Third, we will
develop the sparse moderated mediation methods for high-dimensional predictors and
mediators accounting for moderation. to test whether network expression during cognitive tasks
mediates the effect of brain changes (measured via multimodal structural MRI) on cognitive
performance, cognitive decline and dementia transition, and whether the derived neural
substrate of CR moderates the mediation.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Intimate partner violence (IPV), a potent risk factor for depression, anxiety, and Post-traumatic Stress
Disorder (common mental disorders; CMDs), is a devastating public health problem with the highest rates
occurring in sub-Saharan Africa. Mental health interventions that aim to reduce IPV often fail to include men,
which could be addressed by treatment in a couple modality. Yet, couple-based treatments often exclude
couples who are living with IPV. The goal of this K23 Award is to expand the candidate’s skillset and prepare
her to conduct independent research on couple-based mental health interventions for CMDs that address
social determinants, such as IPV, to improve mental health outcomes and sustainability of gains. The proposed
training program involves mentorship from leading experts, coursework and workshops, attending and
presenting at scientific conferences, and developing collaborative manuscripts for publication to develop
competency in (1) engagement and mental health treatment of men; (2) adaptation of an evidence-based
treatment for CMDs to address IPV in couples; (3) methods and analyses of randomized controlled trials for
couples; and (4) skills for a successful career as an independent investigator.
 These training goals and activities will align with the aims of a research study in Mozambique, one of
the poorest countries in the world with a significant mental health treatment gap. Half of women in Mozambique
endorsed being exposed to IPV in the past year, and there are high prevalence rates of CMDs. The candidate
is Project Director of PRIDE (Partnerships in Research to Implement and Disseminate Sustainable and
Scalable EBPs, U19MH113203), a collaborative project with the Mozambique Ministry of Health that is scaling-
up comprehensive mental health care across a province using Interpersonal Counseling (IPC) to treat CMDs.
Scale-up, however, has not considered the coordinated treatment of CMDs and the co-occurring problem of
IPV among couples. The overall goal of the research plan is to investigate the feasibility of reducing CMDs in
women through a couple-based treatment that addresses CMDs and situational IPV (discord between intimate
partners that escalates to physical violence). This study has three specific aims. The first aim is to identify
gender roles including local contextual influences relevant to engaging men in couple-based treatment of IPV
in public MH care. The second aim is to adapt IPC-C to reduce CMDs in female partners through resolution of
IPV and improvement of couple functioning. The third aim is to determine acceptability and feasibility of using
Interpersonal Counseling for Couples (IPC-C) to reduce CMDs in women and IPV in couples. This study has
applicability for low-resource populations internationally and the US that experience couple-based violence and
a mental health treatment gap. With its focus on intimate partners, the intervention also has the potential to
benefit health and wellbeing of children.

Significance. Cannabis use is increasing exponentially among older US adults (≥65 years), a population that is
expected to comprise over 20% of the population in coming decades. Older adults are particularly vulnerable to
cognitive impairment associated with cannabis use, and demonstrate increasingly heterogeneous patterns of
cannabis use (including cannabis use histories and current use profiles). Consequently, this rapidly growing
population of cannabis users will become a public health concern in coming years and merit preventive and
therapeutic interventions. Extant information on cannabis use patterns and their associations with cognitive
impairment is lacking in this critically understudied population. This research proposal examines associations
between a range of cannabis use measures and cognitive impairment, particularly residual impairment (i.e.,
cognitive effects observed after acute intoxication has passed), in older adult cannabis users. Career
Development Plan. Dr. Livne’s training program will include coursework and mentorship to develop his skills
and expertise in survey design, aging and cognition-related research, and generalized linear modeling, causal
modeling and longitudinal analyses. These are necessary for achieving his career goals of becoming an
independent investigator performing impactful research on the intersection between cannabis use, cognition,
and the aging population. Mentorship. Dr. Livne’s will be supported by a highly accomplished team of mentors
who are experts in substance use epidemiology, biostatistics, aging, and cognition. Research Plan. For Aim 1,
Dr. Livne will use data from the Health and Retirement Study, a large nationally representative study of older US
adults, to examine associations between cannabis use predictors and domain-specific cognitive impairment,
including residual impairment, among adults ≥65 years. For Aim 2a, Dr. Livne will recruit a large online sample
of older adults via social media platforms, to describe cannabis use patterns (i.e., cannabis use histories, current
profiles of use) and examine the associations between such patterns. For Aim 2b, Dr. Livne will conduct a pilot
study of a subset of respondents from the online sample as well as sociodemographically comparable older
adults with no lifetime cannabis use. Using self-administered neuropsychological assessments, he will assess
the feasibility of integrating cognitive tests in online samples of older adults and provide preliminary data on
associations between detailed measures of cannabis use patterns and domain-specific residual cognitive
impairment, expanding on analyses from Aim 1. Public Health Impact. This project will illuminate patterns of
cannabis use and associated cognitive impairment among older adults, thus informing clinicians, researchers,
and policymakers of individual and public health risks in a growing yet understudied cannabis user population.
Subsequently, findings will inform the development of harm reduction strategies and the feasibility of utilizing
online research tools for cost-effective cognitive assessment of older adult substance users.

This proposed Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) will provide Hyun Kim,
PhD, a post-doctoral fellow at Columbia University, with research training and career development that will
help her become an independent and expert sleep scientist in Alzheimer's disease and related dementias
(ADRD) research. Poor or fragmented sleep increases the risk of cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's
disease (AD) through accumulation of amyloid-β, spread of tau, and accelerated microglial activation. While
sleep's connection to brain and cognitive function is widely established, it is unclear whether modifying sleep in
older adults could delay cognitive decline and slow the development of AD. Understanding the impact of sleep
treatments on cognitive changes could enhance the current understanding of sleep disturbance as a modifiable
risk factor and establish sleep interventions as a potential tool to reduce AD risks. The primary aim of the
proposed research project is to examine neurocognitive performance outcomes of cognitive behavioral therapy
for insomnia (CBTI) and acoustic slow wave activity enhancement (SWAE). The mechanism of treatment-related
neurocognitive changes will be investigated using the changes in objective and subjective sleep
parameters. The secondary aim is to examine the impact of sleep treatments on cognitively-mediated everyday
functioning. The exploratory aim is to assess whether CBTI and/or SWAE are associated with plasma AD
biomarker, namely phosphorylated tau. These research aims will be complemented by career development
plans involving (1) enhancing scientific knowledge in sleep and AD neurobiology; (2) developing skills in
clinical trial methodology and relevant analytic skills; (3) fostering professional development and networking in
sleep and AD scientific community. Collectively, the proposed study, in its research question, scope, and
structure, is designed to serve as a road map for future R01 studies that investigate the intricate relationship
between sleep and ADRD.

This K23 application presents a training and research program that will support the applicant on a path towards
becoming an NIH-funded independent investigator focused on understanding the neurobiology of the olfactory
system in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Training: The activities in this application build on the candidate’s prior
clinical neuropsychology training and research experience and are set in a resource-rich environment that will
foster his development of expertise in 1) principles of functional imaging in AD, 2) mechanisms and neural
circuitry of the olfactory system, 3) biostatistics and psychometrics, and 4) responsible conduct of research.
These training goals will be supported by a combination of didactics, formal advisory plans, and hands-on-
practicum throughout the award period. Under the guidance of his primary mentor, Dr. Davangere Devanand,
his co-mentor Dr. Terry Goldberg, scientific advisors (Drs. Gaurav Patel, Prasanna Karunanayaka, Mark
Albers, Jonas Olofsson, and Scott Small), and peer mentor (Dr. Jonathan Overdevest), the candidate will
acquire advanced skills in neuroimaging methodologies, olfactory evaluations, and AD biomarker mechanics
that will be directly applied to this proposal. Research: The overarching goal of the research to be carried out in
this application is to determine the neural mechanisms underlying odor memory deficits, and to define the
relationship between odor memory and AD biomarkers using a new process-pure variant of an odor memory
test. There is an urgent and unmet need to develop tools for enhancing early detection of AD. Olfaction and
memory are systems in which impairments develop during initial stages of AD. Odor memory, which combines
these two systems, has potential for improving upon the capabilities of existing tools which commonly measure
either system in isolation. Currently, the precise neural substrates of odor memory remain undefined. By
investigating the brain activation patterns involved in odor memory, there is promise for enhancing our ability to
identify individuals at risk for decline. This proposal will be the first to evaluate odor detection and odor memory
jointly within the same imaging paradigm. Aim 1 of the research project will examine fMRI task-related signal in
the olfactory cortex and medial temporal lobe during an fMRI odor memory procedure. Patients with AD,
patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment, and cognitively intact older adults will undergo scanning. Aim
2 strives to establish the association of abnormal odor memory with apolipoprotein genotype and plasma tau
biomarkers. In Aim 3, the clinical utility of odor memory for differentiating groups (patients with AD, patients
with mild cognitive impairment, and cognitively intact older adults) will be compared against established odor
identification and verbal memory measures.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Adolescence is a window of vulnerability for the development of schizophrenia and other mental disorders. In
schizophrenia, imaging studies have found that thalamo-prefrontal resting state connectivity is reduced during
adolescence prior to disease onset. This decrease in functional connectivity has been linked to cognitive
symptoms and the etiology of the disorder. For many years, an altered maturation of the prefrontal cortex (PFC)
has been implicated in the cognitive deficits of mental disorders yet the mechanisms that drive PFC maturation
are largely unknown. Because thalamic input activity is important for circuit maturation in sensory cortices, we
hypothesize here that thalamic input activity is also important for prefrontal circuit maturation.
To address whether adolescence is a sensitive time-period during which thalamic activity regulates the
maturation of PFC circuitry, we used mice and compared the effects of reducing activity in the thalamic nuclei
projecting to the PFC during postnatal days P20-50 with that in adulthood (P90-120). We found that inhibiting
the thalamus during adolescence leads to a long-lasting decrease in the density of thalamo-mPFC projections
and a reduced excitatory drive to mPFC neurons. Adolescent thalamic inhibition further causes cognitive deficits
in attentional set shifting during adulthood that are associated with disrupted correlated neuronal activity and
task outcome encoding in the mPFC. In contrast, thalamic inhibition during adulthood has no long-lasting
consequences on mPFC excitation, correlated activity, outcome encoding and behavior. Strikingly, exciting the
thalamus in adulthood during the set shifting task rescues in vivo neuronal activity and cognitive deficits induced
by adolescent inhibition.
While these data point to adolescence as a sensitive time window for PFC circuit maturation the underlying
mechanisms by which adolescent inhibition impairs mPFC maturation are still unclear. To address this, first, the
development of mPFC circuitry needs to be characterized during adolescence. Second, it will be important to
determine whether adolescent inhibition induces long-lasting changes in intrinsic mPFC circuitry, and which
specific mPFC projections and interneurons are regulated by adolescent thalamic inhibition. Third, it will be
important to know when such changes arise and how they relate to the changes in in vivo cross correlated activity
and outcome encoding. Our data further suggest that boosting thalamic activity could provide a strategy for
rescuing cognitive deficits in neurodevelopmental disorders. However, as presented, the beneficial effect only
occurs while the thalamus is stimulated. Therefore, strategies will need to be identified that allow for a longer
lasting rescue of the cognitive abilities. We will address these questions using three aims: Aim 1: To determine
when and where adolescent thalamic activity regulates the development of mPFC circuit connectivity. Aim 2: To
determine whether the impact of adolescent thalamic inhibition on cognition requires maturation of the mPFC.
Aim 3. To determine whether thalamic excitation can lead to a long-lasting rescue of the cognitive deficit.

neurotypical normally aging (NA) subjects from adolescence into the 90s, and 40 Alzheimer’s Disease (AD)
brains, with BRAIN Initiative-generated datasets from human brain tissue. We are implementing high resolution
mass spectrometry (HRMS) (Stephens et al., 2018; Wobma et al., 2018a; Wobma et al., 2018b), 10X Genomics
single nuclei RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq), sn Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin sequencing
(snATAC-seq), Visium spatial transcriptomics (10X Genomics), and our custom-made slide-seq technology,
using deterministic barcoding in tissue for spatial omics sequencing (DBiT-seq), for co-mapping mRNAs
and proteins (Liu et al., 2020), ATAC spatial sequencing (Deng et al., 2022) and RNA-ATAC co-profiling (Zhang
et al., 2023). We will integrate our data with publicly available datasets from GEO (Gene Expression Omnibus),
SCORCH (Single Cell Opioid Responses in the Context of HIV), PsychENCODE Consortium, NeMO
(Neuroscience Multi-Omic Data Archive), SEA-AD (Seattle Alzheimer’s Disease Brain Cell Atlas), Psych-AD
(Neuropsychiatric Symptoms in Alzheimer’s Disease) and the BICCN (BRAIN Initiative Cell Census Network).
We will include external datasets on hippocampus and other brain regions, to implement analyses on gene
regulatory networks (GRNs) that are common to neurons and glial cells across brain regions, and identify GRNs
that synergistically regulate functional brain circuits involved in cognitive, emotional, and behavioral changes in
AD. The hippocampus, fundamental for memory, the amygdala, regulating emotional responses to stress and
“fight or flight” reactions, and the prefrontal cortex (PFC), involved in set shifting, attentional control, and decision
making, are all progressively affected in AD, and they are involved in AD neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS),
such as disinhibition, impulsivity, anxiety, emotional distress, aggression, paranoid ideation, and other psychotic
symptoms. Understanding how those brain regions are regulated by cell-type specific epigenetic and gene
expression changes, will shed light on molecular mechanisms of AD pathogenesis and provide targets for new
therapeutic approaches to AD and NPS in AD. This supplement is within the scope of the active award and
improves the discovery potential of our dataset. This project will provide scalable pipelines for analyzing
multimodal and spatial omics cell profiling datasets, and will deliver a developmental and adult cell atlas of cell
type diversity. It will provide information on the regulome, the interaction between regulatory components that
control the state of expression of genes and their isoforms, their subcellular location, tissue state, development,
and pathology. These regulatory mechanisms include DNA accessibility for gene transcription, DNA methylation,
transcription factors that regulate gene transcription, RNA-protein interactions, and non-coding RNAs involved
in splicing, ribosome synthesis, degradation of mRNAs, and translation repression. The supplement will provide
broad sharing of our data via an NIH supported database and contribute to a reference atlas of human cell types.

The overarching goal of this project is to create exhibits and programs that educate broad
audiences, especially Black and Latino adolescents and young adults, about public health
careers and their role in alleviating the inequitable health outcomes that Black and Latino
communities suffer from. We will use the COVID-19 pandemic as the content focus for these
exhibits and programs. Key learning outcomes will include:
 1. COVID-19 and other health challenges have had a disproportionate impact on Black and
 Latino people, for a variety of interconnected reasons;
 2. Minimizing this disproportionate impact will require creating locally-tailored,
 culturally-responsive public health interventions and engaging community-level public
 health experts to recruit and support public participation;
 3. There are many health- and medicine-focused career pathways that young people can
 pursue that can help them contribute to the goal of better protecting vulnerable
 communities from future epidemics and pandemics.
The specific aims of this five-year proposed project are to:
 1. Project Years 1-2: Engage public health experts and community members from Queens,
 NY in a range of public events to build trust, gather input, track the latest emerging
 scientific knowledge COVID-19 and effective tracing, diagnosis and treatment; and guide
 the design and development of exhibits and workshops that address project goals.
 2. Project Year 3: Fabricate five exhibit pieces and create a career exploration workshop
 series that address these goals, pilot them at the New York Hall of Science, evaluate
 their impact and revise as needed.
 3. Project Year 4: Pilot the exhibit pieces and workshop series at a peer science center in
 Oakland, CA, evaluate their impact and revise as needed.
 4. Project year 5: Produce final versions of the exhibit pieces for the New York Hall of
 Science; disseminate exhibit plans for use at other museum sites; disseminate workshop
 formats for use at other museum sites; disseminate evaluation findings.
The project will use formative testing and prototyping to inform the design and development of
educational resources. The project evaluation will use culturally-responsive, rigorous methods to
both monitor project progress and quality and to test the impact of project deliverables on
participants and public audiences.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating progressive neurodegenerative disease in which the loss of
upper (primary motor cortex, M1) and lower (spinal cord, SC) motor neurons (MNs) ultimately leads to total
paralysis. MN loss in ALS involves cell autonomous and non-cell autonomous activities in multiple cell types of
the M1 and SC, the organization of which are well understood. However, there remain 4 major gaps in our
knowledge: 1) How ALS-associated molecular pathology in the various cell types of the M1 relates to those in
the SC; 2) How subpopulations of specific cell types are spatially arranged in these two regions; 3) How
subpopulations of different cell types are organized in higher-order ensembles; and 4) How the coordinated
behavior of these ensembles relates to disease-associated molecular pathology (e.g., pathognomonic
inclusions). Towards addressing these questions, we propose to develop a spatially resolved multi-omics
catalog of cellular subpopulations in the M1 and SC of patients with ALS and healthy controls. By using
a combination of approaches to simultaneously map the spatial transcriptome and proteome of all interacting
cellular subpopulations in these regions, our aim is to elucidate the origins and temporal dynamics of inter- and
intra-cellular activities that may reveal novel diagnostic and therapeutic targets for ALS. Our overarching
hypothesis is that ALS pathology stems from dysfunctional MN-glial interactions, and that this predictably differs
in the M1 and SC in accordance with patient symptomatology. To address this hypothesis, we propose to use
spatially resolved transcriptomic and proteomic measurements to study intact human postmortem tissue from
patients stratified by clinical presentation (i.e., site of initial symptom presentation, bulbar or lower limb). We have
previously implemented Spatial Transcriptomics on mouse and human SC to identify regional differences within
subpopulations of various cell types that vary as a function of disease dynamics. Here, we propose to build upon
our existing human study, and for the first time, develop a spatially resolved multi-omics dataset at scale and in
the context of disease in matched human postmortem M1 and SC samples (Aim 1), to enable simultaneous
exploration of upper and lower motor neurons in the context of intact tissue. These data will be directly tied to
measures of ALS pathology (e.g., pathognomonic inclusions). To integrate and analyze relationships between
data across modalities, we will develop a computational framework for harmonized analysis of multi-modal, multi-
omic measures of ALS disease burden (Aim 2). Finally, we will implement highly multiplexed immuno-imaging
to validate top gene candidates generated in Aim 1 at a single-cell level in situ (Aim 3). We expect to obtain an
unmatched view of cellular interactions in the postmortem ALS M1 and SC, and to be able to directly link such
interactions to features of ALS pathology in situ. This will allow us to identify dysregulated signaling that drives
upper and lower motor neuron loss and associated symptoms in patients in ALS.

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified thousands of common and rare genetic variants
associated with complex traits and common diseases. Most variants map to the 98% of the genome that is
noncoding, with their target genes or function largely unknown. This is the variant-to-function problem (V2F), and
solving it remains a major hurdle in human genetics research. To help solve V2F, I propose to develop modular
workflows combining GWAS variant prioritization methods and pooled single-cell CRISPR screens for target
gene identification. I have developed an integrative approach combining highly polygenic blood trait GWASs and
pooled single-cell CRISPR inhibition (CRISPRi) screens in a human erythroid progenitor cell model (K562), to
identify target genes: Systematic Targeting and Inhibition of Noncoding GWAS loci with single-cell sequencing
(STING-seq). STING-seq can functionally dissect multiple GWAS loci in a massively parallel fashion, identifying
target genes in cis as well as trans-regulatory networks. Here, I will develop STING-seq further and examine its
generalizability for other GWAS traits and their cell models. First, I will expand STING-seq with precise variant
insertion, developing base editing STING-seq (Bee-STING) for high-throughput measurements of GWAS variant
effects on target genes and regulatory networks. Second, I will develop modular workflows for GWAS variant
prioritization for STING-seq, targeting sets of variants with distinct selection criteria to increase STING-seq’s
target gene and regulatory network discovery rate. Third, I will focus STING-seq on new GWAS traits and cell
models to examine its generalizability, first piloting STING-seq for another highly polygenic complex trait, bone
mineral density, with a human osteoblast cell model (hFOB). In the long-term, these aims will help solve V2F for
human genetics research, as their continued development and application will improve our understanding of how
GWAS variants causally influence complex traits and common diseases. I have a comprehensive training plan
in place with my primary mentors, Dr. Neville Sanjana (genome engineering) and Dr. Tuuli Lappalainen (gene
regulation), my mentorship committee members, Dr. David Knowles (machine learning), Dr. Aravinda
Chakravarti (human genetics), Dr. Charles Farber (bone biology), and my collaborator Dr. Eugene Katsevich
(statistical methods). This plan will continue my training in dissecting GWAS variant function with multiple
computational and experimental approaches, along with additional training in grant writing, mentoring students,
teaching courses, and presenting at research conferences. The full mentorship committee will direct me to
pertinent literature, offer advice on my research program, and provide guidance as I navigate the academic job
market. The New York Genome Center is the ideal training location for me, given its cutting-edge facilities,
plentiful opportunities for career and intellectual development, and collaborative research environment. Upon
completion of this training program, I will be well-positioned to lead my own interdisciplinary research lab and
become a leader in the fields of human complex traits genetics and genome engineering.

A chronic inflammatory state is now considered a hallmark of sickle cell disease (SCD) resulting from ongoing
hemolytic insult to the underlying vasculature and repeated cycles of vaso-occlusion crisis (VOC). Transfusions
remain a cornerstone treatment for patients with SCD, but unlike other transfused patient populations, a higher
proportion (20-50%) of patients with SCD develop alloantibodies with potentially life-threatening sequalae. These
include poorly understood delayed transfusion reactions (DHTRs) whose occurrence, as well as clinical
progression from mild to severe, is unpredictable. A long-standing interest of our research program has been to
understand the underling immune mechanisms leading to SCD complications including VOC and transfusion
complications. Our studies have uncovered an underappreciate role of circulating monocytes and the innate
immune response to hemolysis, a hallmark of SCD, in transfusion complications including alloimmunization and
DHTRs. Our projected studies as part of this R35 will be focused on innate immune cellular pathways that
magnify the inflammatory SCD state versus the cells' heme protective pathways such as the heme detoxifying
key enzyme heme oxygenase 1 in alloimmunization and in the development of DHTRs. Our laboratory has also
identified a novel function for a subset of circulating monocytes, referred to as patrolling monocytes (PMo), in
their ability to scavenge and remove damaged endothelium and endothelial-attached sickle RBCs. The discovery
of a novel mechanism of action of PMo in SCD offers a paradigm shift in our understanding of VOC and opens
up the possibility that PMos can be manipulated to prevent painful VOC. An objective of the proposed studies in
this R35 is to understand the mechanisms by which PMo protect SCD vasculature and how they are affected
both functionally and numerically during a vaso-occlusive event with the goal to help establish their role in VOC
pathophysiology, and their potential as a therapeutic target for VOC. As we have done in the past, all the
proposed studies for both objectives will combine the use of in vivo mouse models, in vitro human model
systems, and patient samples to mechanistically dissect in a rigorous manner how specific immune cell types
and molecular pathways contribute to SCD alloimmunization and VOC. Altogether, we believe that our
laboratory's approach of integrating studies in humans and experimental models to mechanistically dissect
immune pathways that regulate SCD complications is likely to be impactful and generate novel findings in areas
critical to the NHLBI scientific mission.

 Cross-linking mass spectrometry (CLMS) is playing an increasingly important role in determining protein 3D
structures. By structural elucidation of cross-links (i.e., cross-linked peptides resulting from digestion of cross-
linked proteins or protein complexes), CLMS can determine distance constraints between specific functional
groups that can be used to guide structural modeling and docking of proteins and protein complexes. Further
quantitative analysis of cross-links would allow exploration of dynamic protein conformational changes in
solution, a challenging task for traditional structural biology techniques. However, absolute quantitative analysis
of cross-links is very challenging, due to lack of standard cross-linked peptides. To tackle this issue, we propose
to develop a novel absolute quantitative cross-linking mass spectrometry (aqCLMS) using coulometric mass
spectrometry (CMS), a method recently developed in our laboratory for absolute quantitation without using
standards. It is based on electrochemical oxidation of cross-links to produce electric current and the
measurement of the oxidation yield by MS, therefore eliminating the need of using any standards for absolute
quantitation. An aqCLMS method would enable: 1) quantitative analysis and comparison among all cross-links
at one particular or different conformational states, greatly increasing information about residue accessibilities
and their distance constraints in comparison with traditional CLMS; 2) evaluating absolute quantities of transient
protein complexes that form during a particular biological event, which is difficult to measure using existing
techniques. We foresee that our aqCLMS method is very informative in probing dynamic protein conformations,
which would have high impact in structural biology and drug discovery.
 In this project, we propose to use this aqCLMS approach to probe and quantify the conformational structures
of PROteolysis TArgeting Chimera (PROTAC)-mediated complexes, specifically BRD4-PROTAC-CRBN. A key
step in PROTAC is the formation of an induced protein complex where a degrader molecule recruits an E3 ligase
to the protein of interest (POI) to facilitate the ubiquitination of the POI, eventually leading to its proteasomal
degradation. Thus, rational design of PROTACs will require a structural understanding of target-PROTAC-E3
ternary complexes, which is, however, still very limited. In this project, in combination with advanced molecular
dynamics (MD) simulations, aqCLMS would provide deep insights into the dynamic nature of the PROTAC-
mediated ternary structure ensemble beyond what is seen in the crystal structures.

 The discovery of functional brain connectivity (FC) and functional networks (FNs) have propelled the
neuroimaging field, particularly in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), which has experienced an
exponential growth in recent years. FNs have allowed us to better understand extrinsic and intrinsic brain
properties in various disease and healthy states, leading to better characterization of neuropsychiatric
disorders. However, current fMRI analyses are constrained to the gray matter (GM) region of the brain and
fMRI data from the white matter (WM) region are often discarded, which makes up approximately 50% of the
brain by volume. Many brain disorders have been associated with WM deficiencies, since WM is critical for the
transmission of information to the GM cortical areas. Despite findings of blood-oxygen-level-dependent
(BOLD) signals in the WM, WM-FNs are yet to be fully characterized, and neither the mechanism by which
WM-FNs may affect GM-FNs, nor how WM-FNs are associated with phenotypic traits are known.
The long-term goal of this project is to better understand the effect of WM-FNs on normal cognitive
functions of the human brain and apply fMRI data from various healthy and diseased populations for more
reliable diagnostics and monitoring. The rationale for this study is based on our preliminary studies which
investigated WM-FNs using the Human Connectome Project dataset. We found that WM-FNs are correlated
with subregions of the corpus callosum, a critical WM region relaying information between the two cortical
hemispheres. Furthermore, we determined an overlap between the WM-FNs and tracts from diffusion tensor
imaging (DTI). In this study we will examine WM-FNs of the whole brain using resting fMRI data from two large
independent cohorts. We hypothesize that the FN measures derived from WM will be similar to that of GM and
the metrics can be used to reliably predict phenotypic traits. The hypothesis will be tested with the following
specific aims: Aim1: To develop and evaluate the time-series, FC and FN characteristics of WM of the whole -
brain; Aim 2: To investigate WM-phenotype associations and the predictability of phenotypes using WM-FNs;
and Aim 3: To develop and disseminate a WM-FN toolbox. To the best of our knowledge, this study will be the
first to examine the reliability and validity of WM-FNs in resting fMRI data, and its relation to brain function. The
proposed work holds significant contribution since it will facilitate the use of WM-FN methods for the
neuroimaging community, which currently lacks the necessary analytic tools to reliably characterize WM
function. This study will provide a strong foundation f or future clinical use of both WM-FNs and GM-FNs, to
understand brain function more comprehensively, in addition to facilitating the use of reliable and reproducible
WM-FC methods.

nerves, not to mention odontoblasts that interface with the dentinal tubules. Trauma or bacterial infection may
inflame the dental pulp, creating extreme pain. Extirpating the inflamed pulp (and potentially replacing it with inert
materials) ameliorates the pain, but the procedure leaves a devitalized tooth. An alternative is possible in juvenile
patients, called over-instrumentation (OI). During OI, the pulpal chamber is exposed to the peripheral circulation
post-pulpectomy. As long as the apical papilla is intact, some tissue regeneration takes place in the pulpal canal
subsequently — although the disorganized tissue does not mimic native soft tissue. In adults in particular, OI
results in non-functional pulpal ossification. Another concern in endodontic procedures is occurrence/recurrence
of colonization by oral bacteria. Such infections may prolong and exacerbate pulpal inflammation. A material-
based formulation is proposed that can (a) promote vascularized soft-tissue regeneration in the pulp, while (b)
resisting bacterial infection. Our strategy rests on self-assembling peptide hydrogels — a class of supramolecular
materials that can be injected in vivo while keeping their gel-like properties. The materials consist of canonical
amino acids and are biocompatible. Such materials need to provide both mechanical support and biological cues
for tissue ingrowth. Somewhat counter-intuitively, a self-assembling peptide hydrogel, without added growth
factors or exogenous cells, demonstrated formation of vascularized soft-tissue in a canine pulpectomy model in
28 days. In a separate study, a different cationic amphiphilic hydrogel belonging to the same platform, showed
efficacy in inhibiting bacterial growth via membrane permeabilization. In this proposal, a combinatorial treatment
modality will be tested for its effectiveness in achieving the dual goals described above. A mechanistic puzzle
that these projects would help solve is the lineage/source of infiltrating cells and evolution of the cellular milieu
in the pulpal canal after pulpectomy and implantation of soft biomimetic hydrogels. Characterization of the long-
term maturation of the vascularized soft tissue promoted by such hydrogels is another target. The multi-
disciplinary project proposed in this Bioengineering Research Grant application would bring together a chemist
and bioengineer (PI V.A.K., an early-stage investigator), a specialist in oral bacterial colonies (co-I C.C.), and an
endodontist (co-I E.S.), to solve an enduring challenge: regenerating biomimetic vascularized soft tissue post-
pulpectomy. In vitro mechanistic analyses, in vivo characterization of infiltrating cells, and histologic/radiographic
identification of long-term evolution of the pulpal soft tissue and the pulp-dentin complex would build on published
studies and extensive preliminary data. Even if the proposed experiments are only partially successful, we would
learn about tissue-material interaction in the context of dental pulp. Success of the aims would produce
compelling data for a cell-free, growth-factor-free, off-the-shelf material formulation ideal for application in
endodontic settings and improve clinical outcomes in millions of patients needing pulpectomy.

Understanding the role of the pharmaceutical industry in propelling the current opioid crisis in the U.S. is an
essential strategy for preventing future epidemics. Using multiple forms of textual data and innovative
methodologies for data mining and triangulation, this project examines the specific impacts of industry efforts to
target military veterans as opioid consumers and analyzes how new industry-driven narratives, or scripts,
about opioid analgesics were circulated. Veterans have many vulnerabilities and are one of the populations
most severely impacted by the opioid crisis and opioid-related harms, including overdose and HIV/HCV
infection. Important documents emerging in litigation against pharmaceutical companies establish that
veterans were targeted as an important consumer niche through advocacy groups and paid accounts from
veterans about the benefits of opioid therapies. However, only a small portion of the documents currently being
revealed in the process of legal discovery have been examined by public health researchers, and very little is
currently known about broader industry agendas and the processes by which pro-pharma narratives became
part of veteran-specific health discourse, driving attitudes toward opioids and raising barriers to non-opioid pain
management. To identify the themes and elucidate the processes by which these scripts were internalized by
different veteran populations, this mixed-method research will triangulate large datasets of pharmaceutical
industry marketing and legal documentation with veteran-themed publications and the lived experience of
chronic pain patients. Findings will be translated into deliverables which positively impact pain management
policy, practice, and the attitudes and expectations of veterans with chronic pain. The scientific team includes
veterans and scientists at the forefront of uncovering how the tobacco industry targeted military personnel and
veterans, along with experts on opioid use and pharmaceutical industry litigation. The systematic textual and
content analyses in this study represent a critical case study in pharmaceutical industry efforts to change
prescribing policy and popular culture and will serve as an important contribution to literature on the natural
history of drug crises and to clinical approaches to pain by achieving the following aims:
Aim 1: Use textual mining technology and analytic methods refined by tobacco researchers to explicate the
pharmaceutical industry's campaign to influence veterans' (and veterans service organizations') perceptions
opioid therapies, particularly within the context of chronic pain management.
Aim 2: Conduct qualitative interviews among veterans with histories of pain and opioid use to understand
sociocultural meanings and cognitive scripts that impede safe, effective, and medically-appropriate care.
Aim 3: Based on a synthesis of data from Aims 1 and 2, conduct T0 and T1 translational research to generate
concrete best practices, tools, and web resources to guide clinical and prescriber engagement with veteran
and other chronic pain populations.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Inter-individual variability is a common observation in studying neural systems but is often ignored in favor of
developing a general understanding of properties and responses that are the mean across individuals. This is
because we accept that neural circuits should produce stable, robust, and consistent activity, characteristic for
each behavioral context. All neural activity results from ionic currents that shape the outputs of individual
neurons or produce synaptic interactions. However, within the same neuron type, these currents and the
channels that underlie their expression show considerable variability across individuals. It remains unclear
how neurons with variable levels of ionic currents and synaptic interactions could produce consistent circuit
output activity with low inter-individual variability of output attributes. The inter-individual variability of ionic
currents is not a static problem, as neuromodulators tune those currents, thereby providing flexibility to neural
circuit activity and behavior. While neuromodulation itself can be a source of inter-individual variability,
functional circuit output should not only be similar across individuals at some basic level but should also
respond similarly to neuromodulators that shape it into different modes of operation, adaptive to different
behavioral contexts. While the role neuromodulators play in providing flexibility of circuits in individuals is well
studied, the role of neuromodulation in producing consistent functional circuit output across individuals is not.
Multiple neuromodulators act on a neural circuit at the same time. Such comodulation is understood to
enhance flexibility by increasing the number of possible circuit states. We propose that comodulation with
excitatory modulators that have convergent cellular effects promotes consistency and robustness of circuit
output. An increase in the number of circuit elements that are targeted results in more consistent overall circuit
activation, and an overall increase in excitability pushes individuals closer to shared upper boundaries of
neuron and synapse activation. We will test this hypothesis in the stomatogastric nervous system, which has
been instrumental in establishing the general organizing principles of convergent and divergent comodulation
and is an ideal testbed for understanding neural circuit dynamics. We will use electrophysiological methods to
determine the effects of single and multiple neuromodulators on individual circuit components, circuit
operation, and output activity. We will apply different sequences of increasing numbers of modulators, either
with converging or diverging cellular and synaptic actions, and determine the effects on inter-individual
variability and mean similarity of circuit output attributes. In parallel, we will use biophysical approaches,
computational modeling and mathematical analysis to understand the underlying cellular and ionic
mechanisms in circuit components that account for consistent circuit output. This work will produce a general
framework to understand the role of comodulation in the production of robust and consistent circuit output.

This application proposes partial support for the annual NBER summer institute workshops in aging and health
care from 2020 to 2024. The goal of these workshops is to provide an annual forum for researchers to present
and discuss cutting-edge scientific research on the economics of aging and health care, and to interact with other
scholars in an environment that enhances their ongoing work. A substantial portion of the studies selected and
discussed at these workshops derive from NIA-funded projects; and a substantial number of presenters and
attendees are recipients of NIA research or training grants. The substantive focus of the workshops parallels the
themes of the NIA-funded Center for Aging and Health Research at the NBER; and draws significantly from its
umbrella of ongoing work. The current themes are Health Trends and Inequalities; Data Analytics, Information
Technology and Health Care Decision-Making; The Economics of Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias;
The Dynamics of the Health Care Ecosystem; Medical Innovation and the Value of Health Care; and Behavior
Change in Health and Health Care.
NIA funding allows for a larger participant group than would otherwise be possible. The larger group made
possible with NIA support includes scholars engaged in health and aging-related research from over 50 research
universities throughout the United States, including many of the NIA-funded Centers on the demography and
economics of aging. The participant group also includes researchers from other countries, representatives of
government agencies, researchers in other academic disciplines, and newer investigators developing or
expanding their research agenda on health and aging issues.

Structural Racism and Discrimination in the Expansion of Hospital Stroke Care Capacity
 Although advances in the treatment of stroke have significantly decreased morbidity and mortality for
stroke patients in the United States, there is a growing disparity in the provision of stroke services between
disadvantaged populations and others. No studies have examined the role of structural racism and
discrimination (SRD) in the expansion of stroke care capacity across communities and subsequent effects on
health disparity patients. The long-term goal of this project is to identify system-level pathways in the delivery
of acute stroke care that contribute to the growing disparities for NIH-designated health disparity populations
(defined as racial/ethnic minority, low-income, and rural patients). The overall objective is to determine the
mechanisms through which health disparity patients experience SRD in stroke care.
 Using national data from 2009 to 2019, we propose three aims to test the following hypotheses: Aim 1,
That disadvantaged communities (defined as segregated areas with high shares of health disparity
populations) experience differential adoption of levels of stroke care, resulting in increased disparities in
potential access to care relative to other communities. Aim 2, That health disparity patients in segregated
communities experience increased disparities in actual access and treatment due to patient redistribution
across hospitals with different levels of stroke care and differential treatment within hospitals. Aim 3, That
individuals in disadvantaged communities and health disparity patients experience widening disparities in
health and functional outcomes.
 In Aim 1, we will identify which types of disadvantaged communities, if any, were left behind in gaining
stroke care access, and whether racial or ethnic segregation and income inequality contribute to these
structural disparities in geographic access. These results will aid certification bodies to consider incorporating
community need in certification guidelines. In Aim 2, our results will illuminate patient redistribution patterns in
communities that gain access to stroke care and pinpoint patients who experience disparities in actual access
and treatment depending on their race, ethnicity, and income as well as the level of segregation in each of
those dimensions. Results will identify the types of communities where outreach might be most effective in
reducing disparities in stroke care. In Aim 3, our results will determine the extent of health disparities among
stroke patients a) between disadvantaged and non-disadvantaged communities after adoption of stroke care,
compared to communities with no change; and b) between health disparity and other patients within the same
community when those communities experience changes in stroke care, relative to those in communities with
no change in access to stroke care. These findings will identify specific communities where additional
interventions (e.g., mobile stroke units, enhancing telehealth access) could yield the greatest benefits.

 Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is a disorder with recurrent, debilitating seizures as well as comorbidities
that greatly decrease quality of life. Many patients respond poorly to medications, making research important to
develop new treatments. A focus of research has been a part of the hippocampus called the dentate gyrus
(DG), and a glutamatergic cell type in the DG called the mossy cell (MC). MCs have a direct excitatory
projection to the main neuronal cell type, granule cells (GCs), so MCs are theoretically in an important position
to regulate the role of the DG in TLE. Although MCs can excite GCs, many investigators consider MC-GC
excitation is weak. Instead, MCs are thought to primarily activate DG GABAergic neurons that inhibit GCs. In
this proposal we hypothesize that both the excitatory and inhibitory actions of MCs on GCs have important
roles, particularly when an initial insult leads to TLE. Our central hypothesis is that during the initial insult,
MC excitation of GCs plays a critical role because it strengthens greatly, leading to strong excitation of
GC targets and excitotoxicity. In contrast, in chronic epilepsy, we hypothesize a very different MC role.
We suggest that MCs resume their normal role to activate DG GABAergic neurons and inhibit GCs,
which reduces chronic seizures. Therefore, during the initial insult, MCs should be inhibited for the
best outcomes and during chronic epilepsy the MCs should be activated. If supported, this hypothesis
would be a paradigm shift by changing the view of MCs in TLE. In addition, the proposed experiments will fill
major gaps in knowledge because little is known about MCs during the initial insult, latent period, and chronic
epilepsy.
 Notably, MCs regulate behavior and cognitive tasks in normal mice. We recently showed MCs regulate
tasks related to anxiety and cognition, which are comorbidities in TLE. Therefore, we hypothesize a role of
MCs in the behavioral comorbidities in TLE.
 Together these experiments will challenge prevailing views and fill several knowledge gaps about MCs, the
DG, and TLE. Furthermore, the experiments will potentially give rise to new approaches for therapeutics.

“Synthesizing, Interpreting, and Extrapolating Interventions to Foster Human Development”
will support diverse scholars of early childhood development using different empirical strategies to investigate
the sources of treatment effects of successful early childhood programs and to compare the growth of skills by
age across them. It draws on a wealth of data collected on three influential programs (the Perry Preschool
Program, the Abecedarian Project, and Jamaica Reach Up and Learn) and subsequent implementations and
adaptations. Members of our team have actively designed, collected, and analyzed different subsets of these
programs evaluated by random assignment. Some programs have long-term follow-ups. This research has five
main aims: (1) Using common (across studies) dynamic analytical frameworks developed and applied in
different disciplines, we analyze longitudinal data on the growth of comparable measures of skills and
outcomes from major early childhood interventions targeted to disadvantaged children, controlling for family
and environmental conditions. We conduct mediation and moderation analyses to control for endogeneity of
intervention-induced changes in mediators and moderators. We examine the intra- and inter-generational
impacts of the interventions with long term follow up, taking participants well into their middle age (ABC) and
late middle age (Perry). These analyses adjust for attrition and non-response. We use both large sample
inferential methods and design-based small-sample randomization inference. We harmonize measures and
outcomes and require those we use to satisfy metric invariance criteria; (2) Building on our previous research,
we use empirically validated dynamic models to forecast experimental outcomes out-of-sample. We build
theoretically- and empirically-grounded tools to estimate the long-run impacts of short-run interventions that
will be available to other practitioners; (3) Update and extend cost-benefit analyses of early childhood
programs. For the first time, we incorporate impacts on adult children and siblings as well as impacts on
middle age and late middle age health and earnings of the original participants. We investigate the impact of
early childhood programs on social mobility; (4) Examine the effectiveness of home visiting programs. We
analyze the influential Jamaica Reach Up and Learn home visiting program and many programs inspired by
it. We compare child growth trajectories from these programs with those from more comprehensive omnibus
(and expensive) early childhood programs, many of which have a home visiting component. This will facilitate
isolation of the role of home visiting in promoting child development; and (5) We investigate in detail the roles
of parent (caregiver)-child, home visitor-child, and home visitor-caregiver interactions in promoting skill
development in a uniquely well-documented adaptation of Jamaica Reach Up: China REACH (10 sites). We
quantitatively assess the impact of “scaffolding” measured on a weekly basis on the growth of child skills.

Clean drinking water is crucial to human health and longevity. Despite enormous improvements in water
treatment over the early 20th century, drinking water pollution remains a critical threat to US public health,
particularly for older people and individuals with chronic conditions. In an effort to protect public health, federal
regulations set drinking water quality standards and regulate the public water purification systems and pipes that
carry treated water to households for human consumption. An estimated $473 billion in current national
construction funding is needed to achieve compliance with drinking water standards, even as much remains
unknown about how polluted drinking water affects health, especially among older Americans. Policy debates
about drinking water regulations highlight the need for an improved understanding of the benefits and costs of
drinking water regulations, including determining whether drinking water investments should be increased and
ensuring that safe drinking water remains accessible and affordable to vulnerable communities. This project
seeks to add substantially to the existing stock of knowledge about the health effects of drinking water pollution
by studying the effects of large federal loans intended to upgrade drinking water treatment plants that service
residential communities. By harnessing quasi-experimental variation in loan receipt, the project will examine how
these loans affect drinking water pollution and how they shape short- and long-run mortality and disease burdens
among older Americans. Because some loans target specific pollutants, like arsenic or pathogens, the analysis
will examine the extent to which these loans specifically affect the pollutants they target and the health conditions
associated with those pollutants. To enable this research, the project will compile the most complete set of
records on drinking water systems linked to pollution measures based on Freedom of Information Act requests
made to each of the 50 states. These data will be posted online to catalyze broader research on drinking water
pollution and health. This project will combine these drinking water records with the most comprehensive
individual-level health dataset—Medicare administrative data for 100% of beneficiaries—allowing for rigor,
accuracy, and generalizability of findings. Beneficiary identifiers will allow us to follow individuals over time
regardless of whether and where they relocate, with minimal attrition. The Medicare data provide the 9-digit zip
code of residence, allowing the analysis to pinpoint the location of individuals more precisely than prior research.
In addition, the analysis will examine the extent to which low-income communities and communities of color
benefit equally from drinking water improvement policies, both in spending and health terms, and it will
summarize the distribution of drinking water quality by household race, income, and other important
demographics.

THE IMPACTS OF ENHANCED DRUG-PATENT EXAMINATION
The legal patentability requirements are designed to respect the balance between patient access to existing
longevity-improving drugs and incentivizing their existence in the first place. However, the patent system may
fail to achieve this balance if it does not provide patent examiners with the resources—mainly, time—needed to
apply these patentability standards. Given the legal presumption of validity of incoming patent applications,
insufficient examination time may lead to concerns that the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) will issue
patents on non-novel or obvious innovations, a result which may unnecessarily inhibit patient access and
thereby compromise patient outcomes. Patent quality concerns of this nature have been particularly
paramount in the case of “secondary” patents—i.e., patents on subsidiary drug features such as on routes of
administration. Given that secondary patent applications are often filed years after the issuance of the active-
ingredient patent, they have the potential to meaningfully extend the effective patent lives of given drug
products, potentially limiting access on the margin to clinically valuable drugs. In this project, we propose to
investigate the full extent to which secondary patenting practices may be extending effective patent lives of
FDA-approved drugs. Further, drawing on certain PTO reforms and features, we will investigate the impacts of
increasing examination time on drug-patent examination quality. In particular, we will address four aims:
  Compiling, reviewing and coding data from both the PTO and the FDA, we will build a database of
 small-molecule drug patents associated with FDA-approved drug products from the mid-1980s to the
 present, containing various information associated with each such patent, including information (if any)
 on claims associated with secondary drug features.
  We will similarly build a database of large-molecule drug patents, though this effort will likely require a
 deeper and more extensive review of raw PTO materials given the lack of a congressionally mandated
 list of biologics-related patents associated with FDA-approvals.
  Using these data and employing various quasi-experimental approaches, we will estimate the
 relationship between the examination time allotted to examiners and the likelihood that the patents they
 issue meet the legal patentability requirements.
  Drawing on the results from Aim #3, we will run simulation exercises to assess the degree to which an
 increase in examination time will shorten the effective patent lives of approved FDA drug products and
 thereafter draw on various estimated moments from the generic-entry literature to estimate the resulting
 effects on increased/accelerated patient access to approved medications.

Nanopath proposes to develop a point-of-care molecular diagnostic that can identify UTI-causing
pathogens and key genetic markers of antibiotic resistance directly from a patient urine sample in
15 minutes, without the need for nucleic acid amplification. Despite the severity and prevalence
of UTIs, the current diagnostic standard-of-care relies on culture-based methods, which take an
average several days to return species-level and antimicrobial resistance information. This time-
intensive diagnostic workflow leaves many patients in pain and/or at-risk of severe infection before
they are prescribed targeted antibiotic therapy. Critically, empiric treatment of UTIs is one of the
largest contributors to the growing problem of antibiotic resistance. Nanopath’s product is a single-
use assay cartridge coupled to a low-cost readout instrument. The assay cartridge integrates
sample preparation with our proprietary molecular nanosensor. Our multiplexed molecular
nanosensor is functionalized with an array of probes complementary to 1) species-specific genetic
sequences and 2) genetic markers of antimicrobial resistance. In our preliminary work, we
designed a 5-target proof-of-concept panel encompassing three bacterial species and two
antimicrobial resistance genes that are commonly observed in UTIs. Our preliminary data
demonstrate highly selective and robust target detection in a variety of sample matrices, including
healthy patient urine. Our Phase II effort will focus on four Specific Aims. First, we will expand our
target panel to encompass >95% of UTI-causing organisms and key markers of antimicrobial
resistance. This will involve rational design and bench-top validation of candidate PNA probes to
inform a finalized panel and probe set. Second, we will optimize the design of the assay cartridge
to integrate sample handling functions, lower limit-of-detection, and enable high throughput
sample processing. This aim will also support low-volume manufacturing of the assay cartridge in
preparation for verification studies. Third, we will perform a series of comprehensive analytical
verification studies on the assay. Finally, we will characterize clinical performance of Nanopath’s
UTI assay in pilot clinical study (n>200) in collaboration with Brigham & Women’s Hospital.
Successful commercialization of this technology will enable point-of-care characterization of UTIs
in <15 minutes, enabling the immediate targeting of antibiotic therapy and alleviating ongoing
contributions to antibiotic resistance. The applications of the proposed platform extend beyond
UTIs and are translatable to other clinical scenarios that currently employ lengthy culture-based
steps and molecular testing workflows, such as respiratory infections, bloodstream infections, and
prosthetic joint infections.

Mutations in the genome of somatic cells in multicellular organisms result from DNA repair or replication errors,
causing cancer and other age-related diseases. As DNA mutations are irreversible, they represent the critical
molecular endpoint of the interaction between DNA damage and genome integrity maintenance mechanisms.
Thus, quantifying diverse mutation types in cells and tissues is essential in genetic toxicology for assessing
genetic risk associated with human exposure to environmental and anthropogenic agents. Current techniques
face challenges due to low mutation abundance and indistinguishability from sequencing errors. We propose
optimizing and validating Single Molecule Mutation Sequencing (SMM-seq), a novel approach for accurate,
cost-effective assessment of somatic mutations in normal cells and tissues. SMM-seq detects single-nucleotide
variants, small insertions and deletions, and structural variants, providing a comprehensive tool for somatic
mutational burden assessment. Our research has two specific aims: 1) optimize and validate an integrated
SMM-seq assay for measuring the mutational landscape of normal cells, focusing on protocol consolidation,
automation, and precision and recall evaluation; and 2) assess the mutagenicity of known genotoxic agents on
human primary cells. In this Phase 1, we will establish the technical merit and feasibility of SMM-seq and
develop a prototype platform, and scale up and expand applications in subsequent phases. The resulting
diagnostic product will address a market gap by providing a practical analytical tool for integrated genetic
toxicity/mutagenicity testing and monitoring human exposure to mutagenic agents, supporting the launch of a
successful business venture.

 The state of the mother's immune system during pregnancy plays an important role in fetal
development, and disruptions in this immune balance are associated with a range of neuropsychiatric
and neurodevelopmental disorders. Epidemiological and clinical studies have revealed associations
between neurodevelopmental disorders including Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and Attention Deﬁcit
Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and family history of immune system dysfunction, most notably allergies
and asthma. Over the past three decades, analogous increases have been reported in both the
incidence of ASD, ADHD, and immune-related disorders, particularly immune hypersensitivities that
include allergies and asthma. Several case-control reports have noted that mothers with elevated
allergic-associated cytokines during pregnancy are at greater risk of having a child who was later
diagnosed with ASD or ADHD. These data raise the hypothesis that maternal allergic asthma (MAA)
produces neurobehavioral deﬁcits in offspring and highlight a yet undetermined link between the
maternal immune system and risk of neurodevelopmental disorders. Using a validated mouse model of
allergic asthma, we have demonstrated that offspring of MAA dams exhibit behavioral deﬁcits
characterized by decreased social interactions and increased repetitive behaviors. This proposal will
extend these ﬁndings by exploring the mechanistic contribution of the allergic asthma-associated
cytokine interleukin-4 (IL-4) in driving the link between MAA on offspring brain and behavior
development. Speciﬁcally we will [1] determine the contribution of maternal IL-4 signaling in
precipitating neurodevelomental deﬁcits, [2] characterize the safety and efﬁcacy of the allergic asthma
medication dupilumab, an IL-4 receptor antagonist, in preventing the effects of MAA on offspring
behavior, [3] examine the neuroimmunological consequences of MAA on offspring brain development,
and [4] associate changes in neuroimmune signaling with behavioral outcomes. The results of these
experiments will determine the extent to which maternal IL-4 signaling in allergic asthma contributes to
offspring neurodevelopmental deﬁcits and inform future therapeutic interventions for mitigating the
effects of maternal asthma in at-risk populations.

This project aims to optimize a critical but understudied ingredient of language intervention provided to children
with developmental language disorder (DLD) – feedback. The project is designed to bridge the gap between
previous findings in our lab of inefficient feedback processing in DLD and clinical practice by identifying the
conditions under which feedback-based learning can be improved in DLD. We hypothesize that the
effectiveness of feedback can be significantly enhanced for children with DLD when it is tailored to their unique
learning strengths. The rationale for this project is based on evidence that learning can be improved by
enhancing the dominance of an intact learning system through feedback. The project will achieve its aim by
manipulating (1) the timing of the feedback (immediate vs. delayed) and (2) the level of the learner’s
involvement in error correction dictated by feedback (active vs. passive correction) to modulate the dominance
of the implicit and declarative learning systems. While immediate feedback is processed by the implicit learning
system, delaying the feedback by a few seconds implicates the declarative system. Likewise, teaching
approaches that prompt active self-correction are associated with declarative learning, while passive exposure
to corrective feedback (e.g., corrective recast) is assumed to support implicit learning. Aim 1 will determine
the effect of manipulating feedback timing on declarative and implicit learning in 140 school-age children (8-12
years) with DLD. Evidence that delaying feedback improves learning in DLD would support the hypothesis of
the implicit deficit theory that intervention should capitalize on declarative learning mechanisms. The project
will test a novel alternative feedback-learning parity hypothesis whereby feedback-based learning is optimized
when the timing of the feedback is aligned with the dominant learning system at a given time (i.e., immediate
feedback during implicit learning; delayed feedback during declarative learning). Within the same group of
children, Aim 2 will compare feedback-based learning in children with DLD when feedback (a) prompts active
self-correction or (b) passively exposes learners to error corrections. Children will engage in two nonword-
object paired-associate learning tasks. In one task feedback will promote active self-correction, which is in line
with declarative learning. In the other task, feedback will passively expose the learner to corrective feedback
and lead to learning that is assumed to be implicit. The project will determine whether children with DLD learn
better when feedback prompts self-correction or when they are exposed to passive corrections. For both aims,
behavioral indicators of response to feedback will be complemented by electrophysiological measures of
feedback processing that can determine the involvement of implicit and declarative brain systems during the
learning process. This work is scientifically and clinically significant because elucidating what manipulations
optimize feedback-based learning will enhance our understanding of the impaired learning mechanism in DLD
and will provide clinical guidance on what type of feedback to use during an intervention.

The long-term goal of this research is to translate years of federally-funded basic science on comprehension
processes and interventions to provide elementary-age children with strong, school-based language stimulation
to improve reading comprehension. The short-term goal of this proposal is to stimulate language and
comprehension skills in Grade 1 children at risk for reading comprehension failure by testing the efficacy of a
modified, small-group, version of the Let's Know! intervention, which has shown to be efficacious as a whole-
class curriculum. Let's Know! systematically targets lower- and higher-level language skills to improve both
language skills and listening comprehension. Delivering small-group instruction affords a targeted focus on
those children with low language abilities who are most at risk for poor reading comprehension, many of whom
have Developmental Language Disorder (DLD). To accomplish our goal, we have three specific aims: (a)
determine the efficacy of Let's Know! as a school-based, small-group, language-focused comprehension
intervention for promoting the lower-and higher-level language skills of Grade 1 children who are at risk for
comprehension difficulties due to low language, (b) determine the efficacy of Let's Know! for promoting the
comprehension skills of children who are at risk for comprehension difficulties due to low language, and (c)
determine the extent to which intervention effects are moderated by dosage, initial language skill, DLD status,
word reading skill, nonverbal IQ, and family socioeconomic status. The proposed project involves a
collaborative and multi-disciplinary partnership among researchers who study basic developmental processes
pertaining to language and reading acquisition as well as school-based prevention and intervention to support
language and reading skills. We use a three-phase approach to accomplish this clinical trial. Phase 1
encompasses key research activities to ready the intervention for implementation in Phase 2's randomized
controlled trial (RCT). Phase 2 comprises a multisite RCT to determine the efficacy of Let's Know! as a small-
group, language-focused comprehension intervention when implemented at children's respective schools. The
RCT will meet guidelines for high-quality efficacy trials in education and prevention science. Phase 3 will
comprise analyses of impacts on children's language and comprehension skills, in both the short- and long-
term, from Grade 1 through Grade 3 as well as moderation of effects. This proposal is innovative in three
primary ways. First, the proposal focuses on prevention of reading comprehension failure, in children most
vulnerable to failure, in a crucially important area of reading instruction that is weak or missing in most US
schools – explicit and systematic teaching of language and comprehension skills. Second, the study builds on
decades of basic research on comprehension processes and evidence-based pedagogical practices to translate
these into a practical intervention that fits squarely within the US educational system. Considering that
evidence-based practices are rarely implemented due to research-to-practice gaps, building the intervention to
fit in the current educational system increases its chance of implementation, if found to be efficacious. Third,
the proposal considers longitudinal impacts of the intervention and moderators of the effect, which has both
clinical and theoretical implications for comprehension processes and interventions.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Although one in four children with autism remain minimally verbal past age five, we do not know all
the factors that limit spoken language in these minimally verbal children with autism. One powerful
contributor may be a concomitant motor speech disorder, Childhood Apraxia of Speech (CAS). CAS
is an impairment in the ability to plan and sequence for speech, which renders speech inconsistent
and imprecise. But because producing intelligible speech is a prerequisite to acquiring spoken
language, there is an urgent need to understand how CAS may affect speech movements and
intelligibility in minimally verbal children with autism, and to develop interventions that incorporate
strategies to address CAS, when present. This project proposes three studies to investigate the
relationship between CAS and speech in minimally verbal children with autism and CAS. First, we
compare a group of 11 minimally verbal children with autism who meet criteria for CAS to a group of
11 who do not meet criteria for CAS. We hypothesize that facial movement tracking, a non-invasive
method to investigate speech motor function, will reveal that the +CAS group show lower movement
consistency and precision than the –CAS group. Next, we investigate the relationship of clinical signs
of CAS to speech movement parameters and to intelligibility. We hypothesize that more severe CAS
predicts lower movement consistency and precision, and lower intelligibility, in an additional group of
22 minimally verbal children with autism+CAS. Finally, we use the previous investigations to inform
treatment for a group of 20 minimally verbal children with autism+CAS. First we identify the speech
movements for each child that are both disordered and degrade intelligibility,. Then, we create a set
of mono- and bisyllabic stimuli involving these movements and train participants on a subset of them
in a series of single-subject experiments. Treatment will involve principles of motor learning (massed
and distributed practice) and dynamic cueing, which have been shown to be effective for treating
CAS. Both perceptual (intelligibility-based) and objective (movement-based) outcome measures will
demonstrate the extent to which this targeted treatment improves speech production in these
children. The findings will inform clinical practice for minimally verbal children with autism and lead to
the development of novel interventions for this severely affected population.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
Improving children’s diets and physical activity levels are key strategies to reduce the risk of obesity. However,
most children do not meet dietary or physical activity recommendations, and children who are from families
with socioeconomic disadvantages and/or who are racial/ethnic minorities experience disproportionately higher
rates of obesity, with Alaska Native/American Indian children experiencing the highest rates nationally. Schools
can be an ideal location to promote healthier habits as children spend a substantial portion of their time in
school and often consume up to half their daily energy intake there. Two promising, cost-effective school
policies are longer lunch periods and longer recess with integrated PA opportunities, but rigorous evidence is
lacking. In this time-sensitive proposal, we propose to evaluate a natural experiment in Anchorage, Alaska of
the implementation of a wellness initiative in elementary schools that includes 30 minute lunch periods and 54
minutes of PA daily (including 30 minutes of recess in addition to classroom movement activities). The
wellness initiative will have a staggered rollout in schools over the span of four years. Our study will collect
longitudinal data from 4,000 students in K-4th grade to assess changes in school meal consumption using plate
waste methodology (Aim 1). Physical activity levels will also be assessed in a subsample of children (n=2,000
students in grades K-4) using accelerometer measurements (Aim 2). Outcomes will be measured at baseline
and post-implementation the following school year (collected during the same month at each time point).
Additionally, BMI, sleep duration and quality, and other factors related to academic performance (i.e., changes
in students’ disruptive classroom behaviors [measured at baseline and one year post-implementation],
disciplinary referrals to the principal, hunger-related visits to the school nurse, and standardized test scores
[baseline and up to four years post-implementation]) will be evaluated. Implementation fidelity will be assessed
throughout the study period via site visits, environmental scans, and teacher surveys. Anchorage School
District plans the staggered implementation of the initiative to begin in the 2021-22 school year. Thus, time-
sensitive funding is critical to ensure adequate time for baseline data collection. The proposal’s significance
lies in our ability to provide the first empirical evidence of the degree to which school policies for longer lunch
periods and integrated physical activity opportunities influence students’ dietary intakes, physical activity levels,
weight status, and factors related to academic performance. This rigorous, innovative, and time-sensitive study
will contribute to the development of a comprehensive evidence base on the potential effectiveness of school
nutrition and physical activity policies, which can help to address health disparities in children, including among
an underserved and understudied Alaska Native population. Study results will also provide essential evidence
to inform local, state, and federal policymakers’ decisions regarding school nutrition and physical activity
policies as well as have the strong potential to impact children’s health more broadly.

This application will provide the Principal Investigator, Dr. Teresa Kimberley, with protected time and
support to (1) accelerate a successful record of mentoring junior investigators; (2) provide research
training to mentees engaged in patient-oriented communication disorder research; (3) enhance
training in assessing voice production and; (4) advance the translation of Dr. Kimberley's ongoing
research on laryngeal dystonia. Dystonia is a group of devastating neurological movement disorders
that can affect any body region. There is no cure or disease-modifying treatment and the
pathophysiology of the disorder remains largely unknown. The most common dystonia affecting the
vocal fold muscles is adductor laryngeal dystonia (AdLD). People with AdLD suffer from a strangled
voice and speech interruption due to involuntary spasms of the thyroarytenoid (TA) muscles. The long-
term goal of this award is to elucidate the pathophysiology of laryngeal dystonia and to develop
sensitive testing and novel interventions to treat the disease. The proposed project builds upon Dr.
Kimberley's cutting-edge work of developing a novel and valid transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)
methodology to assess the cortical excitability of the laryngeal motor cortical area. Recent findings have
shown an atypical pattern of brain activation and decreased intracortical inhibition in people with
AdLD. The hypothesis is that a 5-day inhibitory rTMS protocol targeted to the left laryngeal motor
area associated with the TA muscles will increase intracortical inhibition and improve phonatory
function in people with AdLD. Individuals with AdLD will participate in a randomized, double-blinded,
sham-controlled, preliminary trial. The primary tests will include assessments of phonatory function
(Aim 1) and TMS-measured neurophysiology (Aim 2). Factors associated with positive response to the
intervention will also be explored (Aim 3). This project offers a unique opportunity for mentees to train
in clinical and translational research that is at the intersection of corticobulbar neurophysiology, non-
invasive neuromodulation, and clinical assessment of voice disorders. The rich resources at
Massachusetts General Hospital, MGH Institute of Health Professions, and Spaulding Rehabilitation
Hospital provide an outstanding scientific environment to train the next generation of researchers in
an interdisciplinary approach to communication disorders research. This project has the potential to
positively impact people with AdLD by expanding treatment options, improving quality of life and
reducing healthcare burden for people with this disorder. The knowledge gained from the proposed
study will extend to future research to optimize neuromodulatory interventions, explore rTMS as an
adjunct therapy to current treatments, and to determine if rTMS can be translated to other voice
disorders or types of focal dystonia.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
Herpes simplex viruses 1 and 2 (HSV-1, -2) are epidemic worldwide. Globally, it has been estimated that
approximately 1.5 million cases of HSV-related ocular infection occur every year, with 40,000 of those ending
up with longstanding visual damage. The virus’s ability to spread through airborne droplets contributes to its
high degree of transmissibility, often leading to blinding corneal ulcers. Current standards of care include
concurrent treatment with anti-virals and corticosteroids, which are effective, but have side effects that can
compromise visual acuity. Similarly, during severe inflammatory conditions, corneal transplantation is required
to preserve vision. Therefore, there is a need to develop therapies that can prevent or reduce the ability of
HSV-1 to infect ocular surface epithelial cells, which would then mitigate subsequent inflammation and loss of
visual acuity. It has been suggested that molecules contributing to more than one step in the HSV life cycle
may serve more effectively as targets for new preventative or therapeutic drugs. Dynasore is a cell-permeant
small molecule developed to target the GTPase activities of classic dynamins, a family of molecules that
participate in several endocytic pathways and in several steps in the HSV life cycle. Indeed, dynasore has
been demonstrated to have pleiotropic effects against HSV infection, including inhibition of cell uptake,
intracellular trafficking, capsid assembly, and cell-to-cell spread. The applicant company recently undertook a
project to develop dynasore analogues to protect against epitheliopathy in dry eye (DE) disease. The team
identified 3 lead compounds that inhibit clathrin-mediated endocytosis with greater potency than dynasore.
Two of the leads are novel chemical entities (NCEs) substantially different from dynasore, thus are likely to be
patentable. Importantly, the team now demonstrates their antiviral effect specifically against HSV infection of
corneal mucosal epithelial cells in culture, although with different rank potencies than for cytoprotection. The
goal of this proposal is to refine the structure-activity relationship for antiviral effect against HSV. From this
screen, up to 5 lead compounds with optimized anti-HSV1 profiles will be selected. Then, using a mouse
model of HSK, the most efficacious compound(s) will be identified to take forward for further development.
Following completion of this Phase I effort, the team will have defined the SAR for inhibition of HSV-1 infection
and HSK in a mouse model. During Phase II, the team will prepare additional compounds to evaluate
absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) properties as well as physicochemical and
pharmacokinetic (PK) measurements. Finally, the team will fine tune the formulation and dosage to maximize
efficacy, shelf life and ease of application, while decreasing any toxic or off-target effects.

This is a revised application, modified to fully respond to reviewers’ comments and FDA interactions since the
application (FDA pre-IND meeting held on Sept. 25, 2018). The proposed work will complete IND-enabling
studies to progress cell replacement paradigms into the clinic using induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-
derived dopamine (DA) neurons, and a first-in-man clinical trial for autologous transplantation in Parkinson’s
disease (PD). Cell replacement therapy with midbrain dopamine (mDA) neurons provides cellular and synaptic
repair in the parkinsonian brain, and addresses both the motor symptoms of PD as well as levodopa-induced
dyskinesias. Our previous fetal cell transplantation work shows that in PD patients transplanted mDA neurons
remain healthy and can provide remarkable therapeutic benefit for decades. While fetal cell transplantations
are not scalable for a larger patient population and require immunosuppression, iPSCs are a promising
alternative cell source. iPSCs generated from PD patients can be differentiated into midbrain dopaminergic
cells, frozen and used for autologous transplantation.
The NINDS CREATE Bio Development Track U01 proposal over 5 years consists of milestones within four
Specific Aims, that includes a Phase I clinical trial in human patients with PD. In Specific Aim 1 we will transfer
the remaining mDA neuron product quality control assays for qualification in the cGMP facility, perform FDA-
guided quality control of excipients for the clinical product, and produce mDA neurons to be used in IND-
enabling studies. In Specific Aim 2, definitive IND-enabling studies will be performed to test the safety
(tumorigenicity and biodistribution) and efficacy of human iPSC-derived frozen-thawed mDA neurons in
rodents, as well as testing of the planned clinical delivery device in non-human primates. Specific Aim 3 will
include IND package preparation and filing for an Investigator-initiated Phase I clinical trial, recruitment of
patients with PD and generation of autologous cGMP iPSCs and mDA neurons as well as release criteria
testing of the cryopreserved clinical product. Finally, Specific Aim 4 is a first-in-human clinical Phase I
interventional, open-label clinical trial in 6 patients with sporadic PD, to test the safety and efficacy of
autologous transplantation of frozen-thawed mDA neurons.
This highly innovative autologous CMC iPS cell technology U01 proposal for cell replacement clinical trials in
PD patients provides a necessary step and exploration for the development of successful cell therapy for PD
and several neurological disorders.

Low back pain (LBP) is one of the most common reasons for physician visits in the USA. A substantial number
of chronic LBP (cLBP) patients do not adequately respond to current treatment options. Thus, the development
of new treatments for cLBP is urgently needed.
The use of imagery to treat illness, including chronic pain, is one of the oldest medical practices. Although still
under investigation, literature suggests that the brain responds to imagined experience similarly to the way it
responds to actual experience. Acupuncture is an ancient invasive therapeutic method and has been
recommended for treating cLBP by the American College of Physicians. Previous studies have shown that
both the experience of acupuncture needle stimulation and the visualization of acupuncture needle stimulation
can provoke overlapping brain activation, which suggests that visualizing or imagining acupuncture may
achieve therapeutic effects through a brain pathway similar to actual acupuncture treatment.
Combining acupuncture and imagery, the PI (co-founder of Massachusetts Neuro Technology (MNT) and a
research investigator at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH)) and his team developed a new treatment
modality, 2-dimensional (2D) video-guided acupuncture imagery treatment (2D-VGAIT). We found that 2D-
VGAIT can 1) produce an analgesic effect in healthy subjects and 2) produce comparable symptom relief to
real acupuncture after a 1-month (6 treatments) intervention in cLBP patients. Nevertheless, 2D-video is limited
in its ability to simulate real experience. Recently, Virtual Reality (VR) has drawn the attention of researchers.
Studies have shown that VR is a powerful tool for studying body representation and creating perceptual body-
ownership transfer illusions. These unique properties of VR will advance 2D-VGAIT to the next level.
Thus, the aim of this Phase I R41 (STTR) application is to develop a novel mind-body treatment modality /
system (VR-guided acupuncture imagery treatment (VRGAIT)) that leverages the power of VR, imagery, and
acupuncture to enhance the experiential simulation of video-guided acupuncture imagery and reduce chronic
low back pain. Specifically, we will first develop a functional VRGAIT system / platform (prototype) (Aim 1).
Next, we will perform a feasibility study that treats cLBP with the VRGAIT system (Aim 2). This application, if
successful, will provide a cost-effective and easily accessible treatment option for cLBP and other chronic pain
disorders, particularly for those who may have limited access to acupuncture treatment and medical care.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) remains a major public health problem with poorly understood 
etiology and pathophysiology. Impairment in reward processing and anhedonia are core features of 
MDD. Findings during the prior award period have shown that MDD and anhedonic phenotypes are 
characterized by functional, structural and molecular abnormalities within a CorticoStriatal 
Valuation Circuit critically implicated in value encoding and reinforcement learning. The main goal 
of the this R37 renewal is to expand this line of work in several fundamental new directions to (1) 
attain a better mechanistic understanding of MDD and anhedonia by focusing on a novel target - 
Nociceptin/Orphanin FQ Receptors - expected to yield molecular abnormalities associated with 
CorticoStriatal Valuation Circuit and stress- induced inflammatory abnormalities (Aims 1 and 2); 
and (2) identify abnormalities that map disease course (Aim 3). This will be achieved through an 
innovative integration of (1) molecular imaging techniques with a novel positron emission 
tomography (PET) NOP tracer ([11C]NOP1A) in unmedicated individuals with current or past MDD, (2) 
state-of-the-art analyses of stress-related pro-inflammatory transcription control pathways, (3) 
behavioral and functional neuroimaging markers of key depressive phenotypes, and (4) a naturalistic 
follow-up design. To differentiate between state- and trait-like markers of vulnerability, 
currently depressed individuals (MDD), remitted individuals with a history of MDD (rMDD), and 
never-depressed healthy controls will be included. Based on findings from the prior project period, 
we hypothesize that, relative to healthy controls, MDD and rMDD participants will show 
significantly higher [11C]NOP1A binding potential in brain regions critically implicated in stress 
regulation and reward processing (Hypotheses 1).
Moreover, among individuals with current or past MDD, N/OFQ abnormalities in brain regions 
implicated in stress regulation and reward processing will be associated with (1) behavioral and 
neural markers of anhedonic phenotypes; (2) lower ability to regulate stress responses; and (3) 
higher stress-related proinflammatory cytokines and transcription control pathways (Hypotheses 2). 
Finally, we expect that N/OFQ abnormalities (and associated behavioral, fMRI, hormonal, and 
inflammatory markers) will predict anhedonic symptoms and poorer general functioning at follow-up 
(Hypothesis 3). Collectively, the proposed research promises to improve our mechanistic 
understanding of stress-induced anhedonia and the pathophysiology of MDD, as well as our ability to 
identify mechanisms that prospectively predict reward deficit-related symptoms, thus opening novel 
avenues for improved treatment and prevention.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：The main objective in the field of psychiatry is to be able to treat patients at an individual level. To reach this goal
of precision medicine, large scale initiatives such as the RDoC have been developed to find new ways to parse
heterogeneity in psychiatric disorders. Their success has been slow partly due to a slow transition away from
case-control studies based on diagnoses and limitations due to small sample size. Therefore, there is a critical
need to find alternative solutions at an affordable cost. One strategy is to identify a complex behavior such as
Reinforcement Learning based decision making (RLDM) that is impaired across various psychiatric disorders
and adopt a computational framework to explain heterogeneity at an individual level. RLDM is a multifaceted
construct involving several sub-processes ranging from estimating values of different options in the environment
(valuation), accumulating evidence for these options (sequential sampling), choosing the best option (explore-
exploit behavior), estimating the outcome value (salience attribution) and lastly integrating relevant information
about outcomes and updating the value of stimuli (learning rate). These sub-processes can be quantified by
utilizing computational models. However, prior to building normative models of these RLDM constructs that can
be potentially utilized in clinical practice, it is critical to assess the reliability of these RLDM model-derived
parameters to avoid translational failures. Therefore, our main goals of this proposal are to (1) parse RLDM sub-
processes into mathematically-defined parameters in a large sample using a diverse set of tasks; (2) assess
test-retest reliability of these parameters; and finally (3) build normative models of the parameters and chart the
heterogeneity at the level of the individual. To achieve this goal, we will acquire behavioral data from six RL
tasks, including delay and effort discounting, probabilistic learning, virtual patch foraging, Pavlovian instrumental
transfer and approach-avoid conflict tasks. These tasks are each optimized to measure at least two of the RL
sub-processes separately. We will collect behavioral data and self-report assessments from a community sample
from 1000 participants (aged 18-85). To estimate test-retest reliability of RLDM parameters, we will invite 500
healthy participants from this sample to complete the session again in one week’s time. First, we will apply start-
of-art computational models to quantify RLDM behavior in each subject. Second, we will calculate the test-retest
reliability of these parameters. Third, we will build normative models to link each of the RLDM construct with age
and calculate each subject’s deviation from the norm. Lastly, we will conduct soft clustering on these deviations
to identify clusters and investigate their differences in psychopathology and general functioning.

to identify novel intervention targets based on knowledge of psychological mechanisms, the current
proposal focuses on interpretation bias, the tendency to perceive threat in ambiguous situations. The
overall objective of this project is to empirically test a theoretical model of the intergenerational
transmission of anxiety focused on parent interpretation bias as a root cause. Our specific aims are to test
theorized effects of parent interpretation bias on (1) parent behavior and (2) child interpretation bias and
(3) evaluate potential moderators to refine theories of intergenerational transmission of anxiety and inform
future personalized interventions. Our central hypothesis is that parent interpretation bias influences child
interpretation bias through its effects on maladaptive, anxiety-promoting parenting behaviors, such as
accommodation and modeling of avoidant coping. To test this hypothesis, we will randomize 300 parents
of children ages 7-12 to complete four weeks of a smartphone delivered interpretation bias manipulation
vs. a self-assessment smartphone app condition. The interpretation bias intervention teaches parents to
interpret ambiguous situations in a non-threatening manner via quick, repeated practice and corrective
feedback. Before and after completing their randomly assigned condition, parent-child dyads will complete
self-report and behavioral tasks designed to elicit anxiety-promoting behaviors from parents depending
upon their interpretation of the ambiguous situation (speech and puzzle tasks). Parents will also complete
Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) of parenting behaviors to capture the time course of effects.
Finally, we will examine downstream effects of the interpretation manipulation on child interpretation bias
at pre- and post- visits. We will test moderators (e.g., parent anxiety and gender) to refine theories of
intergenerational transmission of anxiety and inform future personalized interventions. The long-term goal
of this work is to inform personalized, mechanism-focused interventions to improve mental health
outcomes for anxious children and their parents. Future studies will translate knowledge gained from this
project into a scalable treatment that can be implemented entirely remotely via smartphone thereby
increasing access to care.

 Projects like the BRAIN initiative hold the potential for a fundamentally new approach to therapeutics for
severe mental illness. Neuromodulation technologies promise to allow selective intervention in which
pathophysiology is specifically targeted for correction. These initiatives are critically dependent on the correct
identification of circuit dysfunction that causes psychiatric symptoms. NIMH has prioritized this as a strategic
objective: Identify and characterize the neural circuit mechanisms contributing to human behavior and their
disruption in mental illnesses.
 Neuroimaging studies have generated promising leads while almost never demonstrating that these
findings represent targets that can be engaged for therapeutic benefit. We thus lack a key perquisite for
translation into the clinic: For imaging biomarkers to make the leap to translational use, they would need to
accurately identify the circuits that give rise to symptoms.
 In this project we seek to understand how brain circuit dysfunction causes auditory hallucinations in
schizophrenia. Published, technically challenging imaging studies provide a critical clue: These “symptom
capture” experiments that collect MRI imaging during hallucinations have identified a disparate pattern of
activations across multiple subcortical and cortical brain regions. Our hypothesis is that these brain regions
are part of a single circuit than spans cerebellar, thalamic, and cortical brain regions. In our preliminary data we
are able to identify the cerebellar node of this circuit, and then, in an independent cohort of participants with
schizophrenia, we used neuromodulation to manipulate this circuit. We observe that non-invasive
neuromodulation can manipulate connectivity across this entire circuit. Restoration of connectivity in this circuit
is reflected in reduction of hallucination severity.
 In this proposal we seek to confirm and extend this result. We will use non-invasive neuromodulation to
specifically target this circuit and observe change induced on the hallucination circuit in a sham-controlled
study. If successful, this project will establish a circuit-level understanding of how pathophysiology is causally
linked to hallucinations. This kind of mechanistic understanding of schizophrenia symptoms would be
unprecedented and would identify biological target for engagement to reduce these symptoms.
