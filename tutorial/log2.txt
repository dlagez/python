Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) provide unchallenged specificity compared to small molecules, representing a
growing market of 150+ billion dollars. Due to their structural complexity and poor stability, however, they remain
difficult to formulate at high concentrations, making intravenous (IV) delivery of mAbs the “gold standard”. IV
injections present major drawbacks, such as patient discomfort, long injection times, and high medical costs
associated with in-hospital administration. Subcutaneous (SC) delivery is a convenient route of administration
for large molecules, as it allows for rapid injections (seconds), requires minimal skills (self-injection), and allows
for systemic delivery. It remains an open challenge to reformulate mAbs to a SC form. Most mAbs requires large
dosage to be effective (>300 mg), and SC administration volumes are constrained to only 1-2 ml, hundreds of
times smaller than typical IV formulations
SC injections using hydrogel microparticles (HMP) offer a promising method for encapsulating and delivering
protein-based drugs. The composition, size, and mechanical properties of HMPs can be widely tuned to facilitate
their injection through needles for subcutaneous delivery. Alginate-based MP are becoming increasingly popular
due to their rheological properties and high biocompatibility. Additionally, the anionic nature of alginate enables
electrostatic entrapment of cationic proteins independently of the hydrogel porosity, making it a candidate for
hydrogel-based antibody formulations. However, current manufacturing technologies are limited to low
concentration of polymer (<5%), and low cargo loading, typically below 30 mg/ml for antibodies, resulting in
inadequate mechanical and therapeutic properties.
Through the support of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project, we aim at improving
clinical care of millions of patients by reformulating IV-delivered mAbs to a SC form, meaning patients could
administer their life saving drugs with reduced pain and discomfort, at a fraction of the cost.
We plan to leverage Acoustophoretic Printing (AP) to generate alginate MP to stabilize highly concentrated mAbs
formulation. This platform technology enables microparticle generation under modest shear forces without the
need for a hydrophobic carrier fluid, thereby protecting the valuable cargo and minimizing contamination. The
technology features: high bio-compatibility with no oil or surfactant required, making this technology particularly
suitable for large proteins; high concentrations of cargo (>100mg/ml), including alginate (>10%); low particle size
variation (coefficient of variation of 1-3%) reducing costly sieving steps, consistency in cargo encapsulation and
delivery - hence significantly improving Good Manufacturing Practices - even at extreme loading.
This project aims to: (1) Manufacture mAbs loaded hydrogel-based microparticles for SC delivery and
characterize them in-vitro, including encapsulation efficiency, release profile, and injectability. (2) Conduct In vivo
study to investigate safety, bioavailability, and bioactivity of the MP-based formulations in murine models.

The dissemination of antibiotic resistance and the drying-up of antibiotic discovery pipelines threaten to
increase morbidity from routine medical procedures and worsen the spread of infectious diseases. The main
objective of this project is to address the dual challenges of antibiotic resistance and discovery by (1)
pinpointing the cellular pathways involved in antibiotic-induced bacterial cell death and (2) leveraging these
mechanistic data to discover and develop novel structural classes of antibiotics from chemical libraries of >11
million compounds. The working hypothesis is that antibiotic mechanisms of action (MoAs) manifest through
physical changes to cellular structures, and that approaches to antibiotic discovery which integrate this MoA
information can more reliably discover novel classes of antibiotics than current discovery pipelines. This
hypothesis will be tested in two specific aims: (1) develop novel methods of probing and perturbing antibiotic
lethality at the single-cell level (Years 1 to 4) and (2) develop a computational platform for deep learning
classes of new antibiotics which exploits the mechanisms of action of known antibiotics (Years 2 to 5). During
the first phase of this award, microfluidic, optical, and fluorescence microscopy will be used to record changes
to physical properties of cytoplasmic and cell envelope components in Escherichia coli cells treated with
various bactericidal antibiotics. Additional targeted experiments based on chemical perturbations, physical
perturbations, and genetic overexpression and knockout will inform physical and mathematical models, based
on multiscale continuum mechanics, that classify the phenotypes associated with antibiotic-induced cell death.
During the second phase of this award, a deep learning platform which predicts both antibiotic leads and their
predicted MoAs in silico will be developed. This mechanism-guided approach will be used to identify antibiotic
leads and their MoAs from vast chemical spaces, and leads will be experimentally validated in vitro against
laboratory strains and multidrug-resistant clinical isolates. Leads will be further investigated using human cell
cytotoxicity, hit-to-lead, pharmacokinetic, and in vivo mouse bacterial infection experiments.
A better understanding of antibiotic MoAs and the development of novel drug discovery efforts with detailed
mechanistic underpinnings fit NIH’s public health mission and have direct implications for the prevention and
treatment of infectious diseases. This work will establish a quantitative, model-guided platform for better
characterizing and discovering antibiotics, one which promises to offer a fertile source of mechanistic
information and chemical diversity. By providing the applicant the opportunity to develop his research career,
acquire new wet-lab experimental skills, undertake translational coursework, and receive mentorship from
leading experts in antibiotics, machine learning, biotechnology, and infectious diseases at MIT, the support and
training provided by this award will enable the applicant’s development as an independent researcher.

Congenital malformations are a major public health challenge. These conditions are often linked to maternal
metabolic dysfunctions like diabetes and obesity. Yet, the molecular mechanisms that couple metabolism to
the genetic programs that control embryonic development remain poorly understood. Neural crest cells are a
type of embryonic stem cell that is particularly sensitive to metabolic perturbations and has been directly linked
to multiple developmental abnormalities. Neural crest development is orchestrated by a complex gene
regulatory network that endows these cells with their unique properties, like stemness, multipotency, and the
ability to migrate. Our group has previously shown that proper deployment of this regulatory network depends
on the initiation and maintenance of a metabolic state of increased glycolytic flux. We recently observed that
this state of enhanced glycolysis contributes to the regulation of gene expression through a mechanism that
involves a newly described epigenetic mark called histone lactylation. By examining the deposition of this
mark, we identified cis-regulatory regions in the genome that respond to changes in the glycolytic state of
neural crest cells. Notably, these putative metabolism-responsive enhancers (MREs) are located in the loci of
neural crest genes that are upregulated upon metabolic reprogramming. Based on this preliminary data, we
hypothesize that specialized cis-regulatory elements allow gene regulatory networks to respond to changes in
cellular metabolism. We will test this hypothesis in three specific aims. First, we will characterize the patterns of
genomic deposition of specific lactylation marks and test if these patterns change upon manipulation of
metabolic state and lactate levels. We will define how these manipulations affect the organization of the
epigenomic landscape and gene expression patterns. Second, we will examine how histone lactylation is
deposited in the genome of neural crest cells. We will use a combination of genomics and functional assays to
test the hypothesis that YAP/TEAD and SOX9 promote lactylation by cooperating with lactylation writers. Third,
we will test if MREs respond to changes in glycolytic flux by performing STARR-seq in neural crest cells
subjected to metabolic manipulation. Finally, we will use genome engineering to delete MREs in neural crest
cells and test their requirement for transcription responses to metabolic reprogramming. These experiments
will define how metabolic state affects the epigenomic landscape and modulates the gene regulatory networks
that control embryogenic development.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：The goal of this proposal is to better characterize the cognitive and neural basis of face perception
heterogeneity in developmental prosopagnosia (DP) and to test whether potential perceptual subtypes are
better suited for one type of cognitive training program vs. another. This is relevant to the National Eye
Institute's mission to better treat visual disorders and understand mechanisms of visual function. Our pilot
results (N=45 DPs) provide preliminary evidence that there are perceptually-impaired (PI-DPs) and
perceptually-unimpaired (PU-DPs) DP subgroups that may be mechanistically distinct. We find that PI-DPs
have deficient eye processing, reduced holistic processing abilities, reduced N170 response to eye contrast-
reversed faces, and a trend towards decreased white matter integrity in the occipital face area, a face-selective
region involved in face parts processing. We also find that PI-DPs, compared to PU-DPs, show a greater
treatment response to our computerized face perception training program. The goals of the current proposal
are to build on these pilot results to further test and validate the PI-DP vs. PU-DP subgroup distinction, to
better understand the neural mechanisms underlying perceptual heterogeneity in DPs, and to examine
treatment implications of potential subgroups. In particular, our aims for this proposal are to: 1) Collect a large
sample of web-based and in-lab DPs (N=280) and controls (N=140) and replicate our pilot findings showing
eye processing and holistic processing deficits in PI-DPs. We will also perform latent profile analysis to
determine if DPs naturally form PI-DP vs. PU-DP subgroups or rather represent a continuum of face
perception deficits. 2) Characterize the neural mechanisms of DP face perception heterogeneity using
functional fMRI, EEG, and diffusion tensor imaging in 80 DPs and 40 controls. To test better understand the
neural underpinnings of DPs' reduced eye region sensitivity and reduced holistic processing, we seek examine
the N170 event-related potential response to isolated eyes vs. mouths as well as face inversion and for fMRI,
population receptive fields of face-selective regions as well as responses to isolated mouths and eyes. We will
also examine whether PI-DPs vs. PU-DPs have white matter integrity differences in face-selective white matter
regions. 3) Determine whether PI-DPs vs. PU-DPs have differential responses to face perception training, face
memory training, or face perception+face memory training programs. This will involve a longitudinal study of
120 DPs being assigned to either a waitlist control condition or 6 weeks of one of the three cognitive training
programs. Before and after training/waiting, we will assess DPs on a validated battery of face perception and
recognition tests as well as self-reported face recognition. To measure the longevity of potential training
effects, DPs will also repeat assessments after a 6-week no-contact period.

 Various cellular processes generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as superoxide
and hydrogen peroxide, which are key mediators of signaling pathways. Dysregulated redox
homeostasis and ROS generation are hallmarks of diseases including cancer and age-
associated degeneration. Primary cellular targets of ROS are cysteine thiols that form sulfenic,
sulfinic, and sulfonic acids, as well as disulfides. ROS generation is localized to specific cellular
regions, and are short-lived, necessitating spatiotemporal methods to study cysteine oxidation
events. We have developed a chemical-proteomic strategy, termed isoTOP-ABPP, to study
diverse oxidative cysteine modifications. To provide the necessary spatiotemporal readout, we
will expand our current isoTOP-ABB platform by: (1) utilizing caged cysteine-reactive probes
that can be activated rapidly by light for temporal control of cysteine labeling; and, (2) adapting
the TurboID proximity biotinylation method to spatially localize our analysis to specific regions of
the cell. We will apply these spatiotemporal readouts to two ROS-generating systems in the cell:
(1) growth-factor mediated activation of NADPH oxidase (NOX); and, (2) inhibition of the
electron transport chain (ETC) and mitochondrial superoxide dismutase.
 Epidermal growth factor (EGF) binding to EGFR, activates ROS release via NOX2. We
aim to identify cysteine oxidation events proximal to NOX2 and characterize the role of these
oxidation events on growth-factor signaling. In early studies, we identified a redox-active
disulfide bond in a fatty-acid binding protein, FABP5, which is formed upon EGF stimulation of
A431 cells. We will investigate the effects of disulfide-bond formation on the lipid-binding
properties of FABP5, and downstream signaling pathways mediated by growth-factor
stimulation.
 The mitochondria are highly redox-active organelles, and we aim to provide a
comprehensive view of oxidation targets during mitochondrial dysfunction, by selectively
enriching mitochondrial proteins prior to analysis. We will apply our optimized mitochondrial
methods to interrogate cysteine oxidation in a C. elegans SOD-2 mutant with elevated
mitochondrial ROS, and extended lifespan.

 Polyploidy frequently arises in response to injury, aging, and disease. Despite its prevalence, major gaps
exist in our understanding of how polyploid cells alter cell, tissue, and organ physiology. This is part because
polyploid cells are heterogeneous and arise in distinct ploidy states (mononucleated and multinucleated) with
each nucleus having varying sets of chromosomes. It is therefore hypothesized that the heterogeneity of ploidy
states provides cells with a vast repertoire of mechanisms for tissue growth, repair, and adaption to stress. Using
the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, as a model my laboratory has identified the core cellular and genetic
mechanisms regulating polyploid cell growth in epithelial wound repair and aging as well as novel physiological
roles for polyploidy in resistance to genotoxic stress and enhancing tissue mechanics. Since mononucleated
and multinucleated cells arise in adult Drosophila epithelium in response to injury, similar to vertebrates, we can
determine how a cell’s ploidy state affects its cellular, tissue, and organ physiology and disease susceptibility.
The goals of this project are to 1) determine how ploidy state, both mononucleated and multinucleated epithelial
cells responds to and protect against UV-induced DNA damage and 2) elucidate how ploidy state alters a cell’s
actomyosin network to enhance epithelial tension and restore organ movement in the fruit fly post wound repair.
Doing so, will provide fundamental insights into the versatility of polyploidy and how a cell’s ploidy state impacts
human health and disease.

 Tuberculosis (TB) remains one of the leading infectious disease killers globally despite the availability of
robust diagnostics, effective prevention, and treatment. Poor implementation of comprehensive TB programs
and HIV infection remain drivers of ongoing high TB rates in high burden countries such as South Africa. In
South Africa there are many losses in the TB care cascade; an estimated 95% of individuals with TB access
evaluation, yet only 82% are diagnosed, 70% initiate treatment, and 53% successfully complete treatment.
However, it is also imperative to also screen and treat subclinical TB infection to lessen the vast reservoir of
people at risk of progressing to TB disease, especially recent contacts of TB patients and people living with HIV
(PLH). Using implementation science methods and building on the success of the improvements in the HIV
care cascade “90-90-90” targets, our team has recently piloted two TB care cascades for drug-resistant and
drug-sensitive TB as well as piloted a TB prevention program including home visits to over 304 families,
screening 922 household contacts of patients with TB.
 This R01 award will adapt the Systems Analysis and Improvement Approach (SAIA), an evidence-based
implementation science strategy combining systems engineering tools into a clinic-level package for TB (SAIA-
TB), expanding upon successful SAIA models trialed across a range of clinical settings in sub-Saharan Africa and
the USA, and leveraging the PI’s preliminary TB cascade analysis data in South Africa. SAIA-TB will evaluate six
comprehensive TB indicators (screening, evaluation, diagnosis, linkage to care, treatment, and TB-free
survival) to aid frontline healthcare workers and managers to optimize cascade performance through the use
of a TB cascade analysis tool, process flow mapping, and continuous quality improvement cycles.
Our specific aims are to: (1) Evaluate the effectiveness of SAIA-TB on cascade optimization for patients
with TB and high-risk contacts (specifically PLH). We will use a stepped-wedge crossover trial to evaluate the
impact of SAIA-TB on comprehensive TB care in 12 rural clinics. We hypothesize that SAIA-TB implementation
will lead to a 20% increase in TB screening and TB preventive therapy or TB disease treatment initiation during
the 2-year intervention period. (2) Determine the drivers of SAIA-TB implementation variability across clinics.
The implementation process will be described using focus group discussions and key informant interviews with
clinic staff, analyzed using the consolidated framework for implementation research, with additional data
gathered from study logs to describe fidelity to SAIA-TB. (3) Assess the acceptability of comprehensive TB care
among patients accessing care at clinics implementing SAIA-TB at each step of the TB cascade. We will use the
theoretical framework for acceptability and the socioecological model to define acceptability and compare
individual-, family- and system-level barriers and facilitators to completing TB cascade steps among patients
with and without HIV infection.

A cardinal feature of anxiety disorders is exaggerated fear to cues signaling threat. Pharmacotherapies to treat
anxiety disorders overwhelmingly target the diffuse modulatory, serotonergic system, but have limited efficacy.
Dopamine is a diffuse, modulatory neurotransmitter known to regulate fear. Yet, dopamine-focused treatments
for anxiety disorders are not available. This proposal will test the novel hypothesis that A8 dopamine neurons
originating in the retrorubral field normally function to promote fear through projections to the ventral pallidum.
We have developed a discrimination procedure in which a minimal threat cue predicts foot shock on 10% of
trials, while a neutral cue never predicts shock. Rats show selective, modest fear to the minimal threat cue,
allowing us to observe fear exaggeration or fear inhibition via manipulation of A8 dopamine activity. Aim 1 will
reveal A8 dopamine bidirectionally controls ventral pallidum firing to a threat cue and cue-elicited fear. Th-cre
rats will receive bilateral intra-A8 infusion of a cre-dependent excitatory DREADD (hM3D), inhibitory DREADD
(hM4D), or a control fluorophore. All rats will receive Neuropixels implant along a striatum-pallidum axis. Single
units will be recorded from the ventral pallidum and additional striatal regions during minimal threat learning
when A8 dopamine activity is intact, chemogenetically excited or chemogenetically inhibited. Results will show
that hM3D stimulation of A8 dopamine suppresses ventral pallidum firing and exaggerates fear to minimal
threat, while hM4D inhibition of A8 dopamine permits ventral pallidum firing and inhibits fear to minimal threat.
Aim 2 will directly tie bidirectional control of fear to activity in the A8 dopamine to ventral pallidum pathway. Th-
cre rats will receive bilateral, intra-A8 infusion of cre-dependent channelrhodopsin, halorhodopsin, or a control
fluorophore. Optical ferrules will be bilaterally implanted over the ventral pallidum, permitting temporally-
specific manipulations of the A8 to ventral pallidum pathway. Light illumination will occur during cue or control
periods during the minimal threat learning procedure. Results will show that channelrhodopsin stimulation of
the A8 dopamine to ventral pallidum pathway exaggerates fear to minimal threat, while halorhodopsin inhibition
of the A8 dopamine to ventral pallidum pathway inhibits fear to minimal threat. This proposal will uncover a
novel dopaminergic pathway that normally functions to promote fear. Simultaneously, the results will reveal
selective inhibition of the A8 dopamine to ventral pallidum pathway as a promising target to effectively treat
anxiety disorders.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Brain photobiomodulation (PBM) using near-infrared (NIR) light is a promising new approach for treating
Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Despite the high interest in using PBM to treat AD, its application is currently
hindered by the insufficient understanding of the mechanisms of NIR light actions in the brain.
Additionally, NIR-I light (650-900 nm) has not achieved clinical significance due to its insufficient
penetration into the brain tissue. We hypothesize that the key mechanisms underlying treatment
properties of NIR light in AD include the activation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) in the
brain, increase of nitric oxide (NO) production by endothelial cells, vasomotion, increase of glymphatic
flow, and reduction of amyloid β load and tau pathology. Further, we hypothesize that these
mechanisms can be markedly enhanced by the pulsation of NIR-II light (1000-1700 nm) at a low
frequency during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. Our specific aims are designed to test the key
elements of this hypothesis. We plan to test that NIR light treatment is most efficient when it is delivered
in NIR-II window and during NREM sleep (aim 1), that the rate of NIR light stimulation rather than its
duration determines the efficiency of the PBM treatment in AD (aim 2), and that eNOS is the key
mediator of therapeutic effects of NIR light in AD, whereas neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) is not
(aim 3). Thus, we propose a series of translational studies that are aimed to improve our understanding
or the role of NIR light in reducing the AD pathology as well as to identify the way of NIR light delivery
that is most efficient in treating AD.

Cancer has killed over 600,000 people in US in 2020. The cost for healthcare and society is unbearable: because 
of cancer, $180B healthcare expenditure and $134B lost productivity are recorded every year. This is happening 
despite recent advancements in therapy and the emergence of an ever expanding array of new therapeutics for 
the over 1.8M new cancer patients every year. Indeed, because of the multitude and redundancy of mechanisms 
contributing to cancer growth, therapies are often ineffective. Several components should be targeted at the 
same time in order to maximize therapy outcome. However, this is particular hard to attain because of 1) the 
striking variability among cancers and the limited number of cancer specific targets 2) the ability of cancer cells 
to orchestrate a microenvironment of healthy tissue and cells around them, that promote cancer growth and 
therapy resistance. Boston Immune Technologies and Therapeutics (BITT) is developing BITT-1492, able to 
target both cancer cells and their microenvironment. BITT-1492 is an antagonist antibody against TNFR2 – a 
receptor highly expressed in cancer tissue and immune suppressive cells in the microenvironment, where it 
mediates pro-survival signaling. Thanks to BITT’s proprietary antibody design platform, BITT-1492 is the first 
and only antibody able to dominantly shut down TNFR2 signaling. Due to selective expression and key role of 
TNFR2 for a variety of cancers and tumor microenvironment cells, BITT-1492 will find application in the therapy 
of several cancers, starting with Cutaneous T cell Lymphoma (CTCL), where TNFR2 is known to act as an 
extremely potent oncogene. BITT has already completed extensive pre-clinical validation for BITT-1492, 
demonstrating potent activity in CTCL, colon and ovarian cancers. In the proposed Fast-Track project, BITT will 
complete a pre-clinical toxicology and pharmacology assessment of BITT-1492 to obtain relevant data for an 
Investigational New Drug (IND) application. This will be accomplished by performing, in line with ICH guidelines, 
an exploratory small-scale toxicology study to be carried out in Phase I, that will demonstrate the safety of use 
of BITT-1492 for a wider IND-enabling toxicology and pharmacokinetic studies in Phase II. As part of the PhaseII 
BITT will also test the suitability of BITT-1492 production process for cGMP standard compliance. At the end of 
the SBIR project, BITT will be ready to advance BITT-1492 to clinical testing for which a combination of Venture 
Capital seed funds and SBIR PhaseIIb are expected to be leveraged. The successful completion of this project 
and initial clinical testing evidence will help to secure the already expressed interest of pharmaceutical 
companies with whom BITT will engage to complete late-stage clinical testing and launch BITT-1492 into 
international markets.

Cancer mortality rates in the US declined by 26% between 1991 and 2015, but the decline has not been equal
across all populations. Approximately 19% of the US population resides in rural areas; for over three decades,
this population has experienced increasingly inferior outcomes when compared with their urban counterparts.
The underlying cause(s) of the widening rural/urban gap in cancer outcomes is hypothesized to be multifactorial,
with socioeconomic status (SES) both at the individual-level and geographic area-level likely playing a significant
role. Gaps in evidence include the use of multiple “rural” definitions, a lack of evidence on associated geographic
factors, and limited evidence based on multi-level approaches to understand the complex nature of rural
disparities. Therefore, the overall objective of this study is to conduct a comprehensive examination of the
underlying causes of rural/urban disparities in mortality among individuals diagnosed with cancer. In the first aim,
the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) population-level data will be used to examine mortality
among individuals diagnosed with cancer across three definitions of rurality, providing researchers and policy
makers with the magnitude of differences by each definition. In the second aim, SEER will be linked via county-
indicators to 16 databases (US Census Bureau, Area Deprivation Index, Bureau of Labor Statistics, County
Health Rankings and Roadmaps, AMA Healthcare Workforce Mapper, BRFSS, Social Vulnerability Index, Health
Information National Trends Survey, etc.). These linkages will allow us to estimate the contribution of specific area-
level factors (e.g., area-level SES, access to high-quality care) on rural/urban mortality differences using effect
decomposition methodology. In the third aim, the Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke
(REGARDS) cohort (U01 NS041588) will be linked to state level cancer registry data using the Virtual Pooled
Registry Cancer Linkage System (VPR-CLS). REGARDS includes longitudinally collected data for 30,239
participants (44% blacks), oversampled from stroke belt/buckle states (56% of participants from NC, SC, GA,
TN, AL, MS, AK, LA) with large rural populations experiencing the highest mortality. REGARDS collects
information at the individual level on sociodemographics, health literacy, and distance to healthcare,
transportation, and risky health behaviors. Multi-level modeling and mediation modeling approaches will allow for
the examination of the contribution of individual-level characteristics and the area-level characteristics simultaneously.
Results will provide estimates of how much of the mortality disparity is explained by differences in urban and
rural geographic characteristics overall as well estimates that describe the potential impact of hypothetical
interventions on specific mediating factors. Findings will provide the critical evidence needed to inform policy and
intervention development aimed at addressing the systemic disparities in mortality experienced by rural patients
with cancer.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Inflammation negatively affects Tregs stability and suppressive function, impairs the
induction of solid organ transplant tolerance and enhances acute and chronic rejection, leading
to worse recipients’ long-term outcomes. Insights into key inflammatory pathways that suppress
Tregs during allo-immune activation can revolutionize our therapeutic approach to promoting
stable endogenous Tregs.
 Our work strongly suggests that an inflammatory cytokine, macrophage migration
inhibitory factor (MIF), secreted by myeloid cells and alloreactive T cells during rejection and
inflammation binds CD74 (MIF receptor) on the surface of activated Tregs to dampen its function
and homeostasis with opposite effect on alloreactive T cells. We show that inhibiting this novel
pathway either through monoclonal antibodies or genetic deletion promotes immune regulation
and induce exhaustion of alloreactive T cells leading to indefinite heart allograft survival in a
murine fully mismatched model. MIF is a potent pro-inflammatory cytokine produced and released
by immune cells, particularly macrophages, and plays an integral role in innate immunity.
However, its role in adaptive immunity is not well known and will be investigated. Our data show
that graft infiltrating Tregs and Teff upregulate their expression of MIF receptor CD74. However,
graft infiltrating myeloid cells and Teff but not Tregs secrete MIF. MIF then binds to CD74 on
Tregs surface to suppress and on Teff to promote their function.
 Our single cell transcriptomic analysis, TCR sequencing, flow cytometry and functional
assays showed that CD74 deficient graft infiltrating Tregs reduced Interferon regulatory factor 1
(IRF1) and shifted toward a more stable Treg phenotype that exhibits superior suppressive ability
in vitro and in vivo. IRF1 is a negative regulator of Foxp3 transcriptional activity that contributes
significantly to Treg instability in the setting of inflammation. Interestingly, CD74 signaling is
exerted through its intracellular-domain (ICD), shown to bind to transcription factors to modulate
gene expression. Recent work identified IRF1 as one of the binding TFs for CD74-ICD13.
 In this application we will test the hypothesis that a novel inflammatory pathway in which
MIF produced by myeloid cells and Teff suppresses Treg function through IRF1 mediated CD74
signaling (SA1), while promoting the Teff function (SA2). We will also develop a clinically relevant
strategy to dampen the MIF mediated inflammatory process in the allograft using anti-CD74
monoclonal antibody generated in our lab (SA3). This anti-mouse CD74 is equivalent to the FDA
approved human anti CD74 (milatuzumab). Hence, this work has high translation potentials.

part of the virulence, and as supported by their underlying metabolism. Commensal metabolism
in the gut provides an opportunity to impede these processes by depriving pathogens of growth-
promoting nutrients. Using the amino acid and carbohydrate-fermenting pathogen Clostridioides
difficile, we will evaluate how redox metabolism of target carbon sources by the pathogen and
commensals can enhance or limit its ability to colonize and infect the gut. Analyses will leverage
innovative approaches to track nutrient flow among pathogen, commensal, and host tissues.
Studies will further perturb host environments using carbon sources that are fermented by the
pathogen, protective commensals, or both, to assess their role in disease pathogenesis and
progression. Findings will inform small molecule and bacteriotherapeutic interventions in disease
prevention and treatment.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Respiratory viral pathogens have been responsible for major pandemics over the past two centuries with
extraordinary human and economic cost. While most vaccines have focused on antibody neutralization of
virus, there has been growing interest in targeting CD8 T cell immunity for more durable protective immune
memory. Specifically, there has been interest in vaccines that generate tissue resident memory T cells (TRM),
but one issue complicating this approach is the observed lack of durability of lung TRM, whether generated by
pulmonary viral infection or targeted vaccination. Unlike TRM in other tissues, which accumulate and survive for
years, lung TRM have half-lives measured in days. We have discovered an alternative population of CD8 TM that
can mediate lung-focused T cell memory and protection from morbidity and mortality after skin vaccination.
The durability of this immunity appears to be provided by a unique population of lung tropic CD8 T cells
concentrated in the intravascular space of the lung (rather than the parenchyma). Using IAV as a model viral
respiratory pathogen, these CD8 T cells appear to rapidly extravasate and enter lung parenchyma within hours
after infection, providing a rapid on demand protective memory response with kinetics comparable to lung TRM.
Their activity does not require CD4 T cells, and elimination of these CD8 TM cells completely abrogates robust
vaccine protection. Analysis of these cells by scRNAseq reveals that they have circulatory markers, but also
immediate-early genes reminiscent of skin TRM generated from the same vaccination. They are transcriptionally
distinct from spleen TEM and LN TCM generated by the same vaccination and appear to be robust >6 months
later. Most importantly, they provide complete protection from morbidity and mortality from viral lung challenge
and function independently of antibodies and B cells. Using defined genetic models, scRNA seq, ATACseq,
multidimensional flow cytometry, and lung intravital microscopy, we will test key hypotheses about the mode of
generation, in vivo biological behavior, and protective immunity of these cells. We have assembled expert
collaborators in each of these areas to fully explore the biology of these cells and the potential of generating
these cells by epidermal disruption (ed) vaccination. We believe that these TM cells are an important and
unstudied component of normal T cell memory designed to provide superior and long-lasting lung immunity
without occupying valuable lung parenchymal space. We believe that optimized generation of these cells by
improved vaccination approaches will provide a superior way to combat respiratory viral pathogens.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
 Approximately 1 in 3 women and 1 in 5 men over the age of 50 will suffer from a fragility fracture in their
remaining lifetime. Fragility hip fracture is one of the most serious and debilitating outcomes of osteoporosis with
a 20–40% mortality rate during the first year after the fracture. Hip fracture incidence rates are known to increase
exponentially with age in both women and men; and with the rising life expectancy throughout the globe, the
number of men and women who will be above the threshold of fragility fracture is expected to almost double,
with a prediction of 319 million cases by 2040. Thus, the number of fractures is predicted to double as well.
 In this Direct Phase II SBIR, BioSensics, in collaboration with orthopaedic, radiology, endocrinology and
biomechanics experts at Harvard Medical School, proposes to develop a cloud-based software solution for
automatic, opportunistic screening for hip fracture risk using plain X-ray images, called XFx. X-ray studies are
ubiquitous in all corners of the world, are inexpensive and provide high resolution studies that offer insight into
bone geometry, microstructure and density, at a low ionizing radiation dose. The proposed software solution will
include 1) a desktop application for uploading X-ray images and displaying and visualizing XFx results, and 2) a
secure cloud-based backend for receiving the uploaded X-ray images and performing the analysis. The software
architecture will support on-premise integration with a hospital cloud services (e.g., PACS systems) to enable
automatic, opportunistic screening for hip fracture risk using plain X-ray images. The solution will stand by in the
central imaging data server of hospitals or clinics, investigate each non-investigated X-ray image, and if
recognized to include a proximal femur, automatically execute the AI/ML-based classification scheme to identify
patients with osteoporosis or at high risk of hip fracture. If a patient is identified to have osteoporosis or a high
risk of fracture, the software will flag the patient. The clinician providing care for the patient will then be prompted
to consider ordering an evaluation of fragility fracture risk and receive a full report.
 This process is reimbursable under the Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) code 76499 “Unlisted
Diagnostic Radiographic Procedure.” This code is used when no other specific procedure code exists. The
existence of this CPT will support the initial marketing of the proposed solution. In Phase III, we will prepare an
application for a new Category III CPT code and submit if for consideration by the American Medical Association
(AMA) CPT Editorial Panel. Given the clinical need of the proposed solution, and recent approval of a CPT code
for radiology artificial intelligence (code 0691T) for automated analysis of existing imaging studies for vertebral
fracture and bone density assessment, our application for a new CPT code should not face any difficulties. In
the longer term, the proposed imaging analysis technology can be used for automatic analysis of thousands of
medical images that are taken every day in hospitals and clinics. This will enable detection of diseases and
conditions at early stages (e.g., bone metastasis and different tumors), thus facilitating preventive measures and
better care for those individuals at risk.

Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) syndromes span the spectrum of neurodegenerative disorders
affecting movement and cognitive function and are pathologically related to Alzheimer's disease. In this project,
we will develop a robust multi-modal platform for remote monitoring of motor symptoms, speech and cognitive
function in FTLD syndromes using wearable sensors and digitized tests. We will validate this solution in
Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP) by collecting longitudinal data from 60 PSP patients over a period of 12
months. PSP is a severe and rapidly progressive FTLD syndrome that lacks effective treatment and leads to
rapid onset of dementia, disability and death. The rapid progression of PSP will allow us to validate the solution
within the timeline of this Direct Phase II SBIR project and facilitate future studies in FTLD syndromes.
In this Direct Phase II project, we will recruit 60 participants with PSP from 2 leading CurePSP Centers of Care.
These participants will be monitored for 12 months. The sensor data will be collected using PAMSys, a wearable
sensor developed by the support from a NIH STTR grant award. PAMSys is patented (U.S. Patents # 8,206,325,
9,005,141, and 9,901,209), validated and commercialized by BioSensics. The digitized tests will be collected
using BioDigit Home, a unified solution for the collection of digital biomarkers that is currently being used in
several NIH-funded studies and pharma-sponsored clinical trials in neurological disorders. BioSensics has
already customized its BioDigit Home solution to monitor motor, speech and cognitive functions in PSP, and has
carried out a pilot study with 7 PSP patients, who were monitored for up to 3 months using the developed system.
We will collect data from 60 PSP patients in this aim to develop a set of algorithms for monitoring motor, speech
and cognitive function that will enable objective assessment of PSP disease severity and progression, thereby
creating a multi-modal remote monitoring solution for PSP. These tools will accelerate clinical trials that are
focused on the development of novel therapeutics for tauopathies (i.e., FTD, PSP CBS) and can be readily
adapted to many neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease, multiple system atrophy,
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, myotonic dystrophy and stroke.
BioSensics is a 2020 Tibbetts Award winner with a proven track record of rapidly transitioning applied
governmental research funding into real commercial results. The initial market for our technology is
pharmaceutical clinical trials, where BioSensics is a vendor of record of medical-grade wearable sensors and
digital clinical trial technologies for multiple pharmaceutical companies. The current project will significantly
broaden BioSensics' offerings to pharmaceutical companies, specifically by providing a solution for digital
assessments of speech, motor and cognition function, which are relevant to many diseases. This commercial
potential is fully aligned with the latest recommendations from the FDA, NSF and NIH to digitize clinical trials.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Co-occurring anxiety is prevalent in more than 50% of individuals with Opioid use disorder (OUD). This is of
major concern as safe and effective treatment options are lacking for this high-risk population. Anxiety in those
with OUD is linked to earlier and more rapid progression of OUD, and high probability of co-use of other
substances, particularly GABAA receptor positive modulators, such as benzodiazepines (BZDs). BZDs are
currently the standard of care treatment for fast-acting relief for general anxiety and panic disorder. Although
highly effective in the short-term, BZDs represent amajor, but often overlookedcontributorto the opioid overdose
epidemic. BZDs are involved in an estimated 12,000 overdose fatalities each year in the US, largely due to the
concomitant use with other CNS depressants, such as opioids. In fact, more than 90%of BZD overdose fatalities
involve opioids and up to 30% opioid overdoses involve BZDs. Additionally, BZD prescription rates are directly
linked to opioid overdose rates per state. With a lack of safe alternatives that can offer comparable efficacy, BZD
market predictions indicate their use will remain steady or increase globally. Thus, there is an urgent need to
develop safe and comparably effective alternatives to BZDs for those with OUD. We have discovered a novel
series of promising synthetic GABAAR active molecules Our lead molecule, RU-EC2-118, is a partial GABAAR
PAM with nanomolar potency at GABAAR subtypes and high oral bioavailability. Our in vivo studies in rodent
models, strongly support the potential for the mechanismof RUEC2-118 to provide effective fast-actinganxiolytic
activity and a safer profile with co-use with other CNS-depressing substances. The major technical aims of the
STTR parent grant is to provide proof-of-concept data supporting the feasibility of our approach in maintaining
efficacy and reducing overdoserisks. Specific aim3 is to test the desirability of our innovation through enrollment
in the NIH I-Corps program. Having previously completed the NSF National ICorps program, we successfully
validated the need for our innovation. During the NIH ICorps program, our main objective is to further investigate
the best pathways towards funding and commercialization of our innovation .

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Older adults in America are living longer, and there are more of them than at any other time in the country’s
history. U.S. adults aged 65 and older are expected to increase from 54 million in 2020 to over 80 million by
2040. Older adults are at risk for poor health in many areas of life, including physical, mental, social, and
financial health. They want to age successfully as they seek information from their health care providers and
publicly available sources. Over 40% of adults use the internet for health information, although there is mistrust
and confusion because the availability of information is generic and scattered through many different
resources. For this Fast Track SBIR project, we propose the Adult Wellbeing Checkup (AWC) - an innovative
and informative assessment and recommendation tool that will help older adults assess their wellbeing in
twelve different domains and then receive personalized guidance (based on a collectively intelligent hybrid
reasoning methodology) on how to improve wellbeing in domains that were low-scoring and want to improve.
AWC will be designed and developed by BellAge, led by Principal Investigator (PI), James Firman, in
collaboration with Yong Choi and Stephen Engels, and supported by Benten Technologies. The specific aims of
Phase I are: 1) Develop a prototype of the AWC with personalized recommendations in two of the twelve
domains from formative research; 2) Conduct a 4-week pilot with 8 older adult care partners (CPs) and 8 older
adult non-CPs from three senior centers to assess feasibility (engagement, usability, and acceptance). The
specific aims of Phase II are to 1) Modify the AWC prototype for commercialization and provide personalized
recommendations for more wellbeing domains, and 2) Conduct a randomized control trial (RCT) with 25 older
adult CPs and 25 older adult non-CPs in eight research sites examining three of the twelve domains (i.e.,
loneliness, physical health, mental health) to significantly improve engagement, self-efficacy, and wellbeing on
one or more domains.
The short-term impact will be the feasibility, acceptance, and engagement of older adults with the AWC
platform. Then, in Phase II, if successful, this study will demonstrate the development and implementation of
personalized guidance can result in behavior change among older adults. Furthermore, the assessment could
improve wellbeing measurement for state-funded programs and organizations, allowing longitudinal data
collection to prompt future funding and development. For future research, we would further develop the
platform to provide personalized recommendations for the remaining nine domains. Ultimately, this service
could be a guidance system and preventative care intervention for many aspects of life for older adults.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 The interstitial lung diseases (ILD) are a major source of respiratory morbidity, and as a group are the
leading indication for lung transplantation worldwide. Two particularly devastating ILD complications are
progressive lung fibrosis (Progressive ILD) and ILD-related pulmonary hypertension (ILD-PH). While effective
treatments are now available for both types of complications, there is a critical need to identify at-risk patients
before complications have already occurred and treatments become less effective.
 A known feature of pulmonary vascular disease is relative loss of the smaller vessels, referred to as
“pruning,” and vascular abnormalities are linked to both Progressive ILD and ILD-PH. Using advanced image
analysis of computed tomography (CT) scans, pruning can be quantified using existing imaging data – since
virtually all patients with ILD undergo CT scanning at the time of diagnosis, this could potentially lead to
widespread improvements in ILD risk stratification.
 The key focus of this project is to determine if pruning on CT can identify those at risk for Progressive
ILD and ILD-PH. This study will use both existing data from a cohort of highly characterized patients with ILD
from a sub-specialty clinic, and will also recruit a new prospective cohort to collect follow-up data related to ILD
outcomes. This proposal will combine advanced quantitative image analysis tools, rigorous epidemiologic
methods, and a comprehensive set of ILD-related outcome measures, including lung function testing, CT
imaging, exercise testing, survey scores, hemodynamic assessment, and review of clinical outcomes such as
hospitalization and death. The results of this study will help determine if CT pruning is a non-invasive marker of
high-risk ILD – which may potentially facilitate earlier and better treatment of ILD complications, thus
preventing morbidity and contributing to better long-term health for people with ILD.
 During this project, the candidate will develop advanced proficiency with quantitative vascular image
analysis techniques, learn critical new methodological skills, and obtain hands-on experience in the design and
execution of prospective studies. The candidate will be mentored by an outstanding, multidisciplinary team of
experts who will provide rigorous training, complemented by formal coursework, and personalized career
development support. The project takes place within an exceptional and unique institutional environment, and
leverages resources from the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Chan School of Public Health,
Applied Chest Imaging Laboratory at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, and Harvard Catalyst. The data, training,
and career development opportunities provided by this award will position the candidate to be a leader and
independent investigator in the application of chest imaging tools that will inform and improve the clinical care
of individuals with chronic lung disease.

A prothrombotic vessel wall is implicated as a major driver of cardiovascular disease, including heart attacks,
strokes, and venous thromboembolism. Despite extensive research into the mechanisms of endothelial cell
dysfunction, the fundamental question of how a clot forms in blood vessels remains incompletely understood.
Activation of blood coagulation enzymes requires a membrane surface containing anionic phospholipids, most
notably phosphatidylserine (PS). PS-binding proteins decrease thrombosis in animal models suggesting that
targeting PS exposure may be a novel antithrombotic strategy. Plasma membrane PS is normally sequestered
on the inner membrane leaflet. To activate blood coagulation, PS must be externalized to the outside of the cell
by calcium-activated phospholipid scramblases. Platelets readily externalize PS in vitro, and it has often been
assumed, but not clearly demonstrated, that platelets generate the procoagulant PS to promote thrombosis in
vivo. Our data demonstrate that (1) the majority of PS externalization in vivo actually derives from the vessel
wall, independent of platelets, and (2) inhibiting TMEM16 phospholipid scramblases decreases the thrombotic
potential of the vessel wall. We have identified two TMEM16 family members, TMEM16F, and its closest
paralog TMEM16E, that are both required for PS externalization and procoagulant activity in endothelial cells.
TMEM16E is not found in platelets and previously has no known role in coagulation. The central hypothesis of
this application is that the endothelial cell membrane is the primary source of PS in forming a thrombus, and its
externalization is regulated by two scramblases, TMEM16E and TMEM16F. In Aim 1 we will determine the
mechanism by which both TMEM16E and TMEM16F promote PS externalization and procoagulant activity in
endothelial cells. In Aim 2 we will use mouse models and intravital microscopy to determine the contribution of
endothelial cell-derived PS to thrombosis and how it is regulated by TMEM16E and TMEM16F in vivo.
 This proposal describes a five-year research training program for Dr. Alec Schmaier’s mentored career
development. The applicant has a strong research background in platelet activation from the Medical Scientist
Training Program at the University of Pennsylvania. This proposal expands his skill set through investigations
in endothelial cell biology, blood coagulation and vessel wall thrombosis. Dr. Robert Flaumenhaft in the
Division of Hemostasis and Thrombosis at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center will be the primary research
mentor. Dr. Flaumenhaft has a distinguished record of mentorship and innovation in thrombosis research. In
addition, the applicant’s advisory committee will provide highly relevant scientific expertise and critical
assessment of his progress. In sum, Dr. Schmaier has created an outstanding environment to advance his
research and career goals to be a physician-scientist in cardiovascular medicine. This comprehensive training
program will position him to succeed as an independent investigator in thrombosis and vascular biology.

Our research proposes to elucidate local and systemic immune dysregulation in rosacea with the long-term goals
of developing novel preventative and therapeutic targets and improving overall health outcomes for rosacea
patients. Rosacea is a common inflammatory skin disease with unclear etiology affecting over 14 million people
in the United States alone.1 Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) is a microbe-sensing mechanism that maintains immune
homeostasis in the skin through communication with commensal microbes.2-4 Therefore, we suspect that
understanding the skin microbiota-host interaction is critical to elucidating the pathogenesis of rosacea. Moreover,
the immune dysregulation in rosacea does not appear to be localized to the skin. There is a growing body of
epidemiological evidence demonstrating that rosacea is associated with a wide range of systemic co-
morbidities.40-51 Thus, it is also important to elucidate potential systemic immune dysregulation that can explain
the overall disease burden in rosacea patients. Aim 1: We aim to test the hypothesis that skin dysbiosis induces
transcription and expression of the components of the innate immune response implicated in the pathogenesis
of rosacea. To that end, we will perform multi-omics data integration of the microbiome, transcriptome, and
proteome from rosacea skin in order to delineate the microbiota-host interaction. Aim 2: We aim to test the
hypothesis that there is shared immune dysregulation between the skin and systemic circulation that can explain
the burden of systemic co-morbidities in rosacea patients. To that end, we will perform multi-omics data
integration of the transcriptome and proteome from the skin and blood/serum in order to characterize shared
molecular pathways. Dr. McGee’s career goal is to become a physician scientist with the unique expertise to
apply multi-omics, data-driven, personalized strategies to treat inflammatory skin diseases and their associated
systemic co-morbidities. To achieve this goal, she will undertake a combination of formalized coursework,
workshops, and hands-on training in bioinformatics, computational biology, human subjects research, and
clinical trials. She will also engage in career development activities by participating in a grant writing course and
a K-R transition program. Dr. McGee’s research and career development will be guided by a mentoring team
with several decades of combined experience in successfully transitioning their mentees to research
independence. Dr. McGee’s training will take place at two prominent academic institutions: 1) Beth Israel
Deaconess Medical Center, a major teaching hospital of Harvard Medical School which supports ~250 principal
investigators and offers 16 institutional and 12 departmental core facilities, and 2) Harvard T.H. Chan School of
Public Health, which hosts the consistently ranked #1 biostatistics program in the country and supports
computational research initiatives to answer multidisciplinary questions.

Primary cilia function is essential for the development of normal left-right asymmetry, kidneys, heart, central
nervous system and many other organs. Current data indicate that the cilium functions as a signal transduction
organelle, compartmentalizing receptor-, adaptor- and downstream transduction mechanisms for multiple
signaling pathways. However, the identity of essential cilia signals and how signals are transduced by the
cilium remains unclear. A complex of four ciliary proteins, inversin, NEK8, ANKS6 and nephrocystin-3
constitutes the so-called ciliary inversin compartment (IC), localized in the proximal portion of the ciliary shaft.
We and others found that the IC is required for cilium function in vertebrates, with mutations in INVS, NEK8,
ANKS6 and NPHP3 all leading to ciliopathy syndromes that include L-/R-asymmetry perturbation, congenital
heart defects and polycystic kidneys. These defects phenocopy the full knockout of PKD2, one of the two
major autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease genes, suggesting that signaling downstream of ADPKD-
and IC-gene products occurs along the same pathway. We found that IC proteins also control ciliary length and
intraflagellar transport (IFT) velocity, processes that require cAMP signaling. Unexpectedly, we find that
nephrocystin-3 acts as a novel GTPase, suggesting a causal link between IC- and cAMP-signaling. In this
grant proposal, we aim to investigate the functional significance of the nephrocystin-3 GTPase mechanism,
defining the catalytic parameters of the enzyme, and interrogating molecular connections among the IC
constituents and to upstream- and downstream signaling factors.
We hypothesize that nephrocystin-3 acts analogous to a stimulatory heterotrimeric G-protein α-subunit,
switching its activity state off and on, along a GTP-hydrolysis cycle. In Aim #1, we will investigate nucleotide
affinitiy and -turnover of the purified recombinant nephrocystin-3, along with the pcy allele that affects the
catalytic site, and that gives rise to polycystic kidney disease in mice; compared to GαS. We will test, whether
ciliary G-protein coupled receptors may utilize nephrocystin-3 as a signal adaptor, and whether adenylyl
cyclases may be stimulated by nephrocystin-3, to generate cAMP. In Aim #2, we investigate the molecular
details of the IC assembly hierarchy. We seek to identify what protein domains are necessary to recruit
nephrocystin-3 to its proper localization, to maintain the integrity of the whole complex, and if disease-causing
mutations destabilize the structure. We will ultimately measure ciliary cAMP levels, as a function of IC
manipulations, and test whether deletion or mutation of individual IC proteins change ciliary cAMP levels.
These studies connect ciliopathy gene function to cAMP signaling, thereby addressing outstanding issues in
ciliary biology with important implications for cystic kidney disease pathogenesis. The results will help
identifying druggable enzymatic targets within the IC that may lead to the design of novel therapies.

Recent evidence suggests that up to 10% of patients with Pancreatic Ductal AdenoCarcinoma (PDAC) harbor
a germline genetic mutation in a cancer risk gene. For this reason, the National Comprehensive Cancer
Network (NCCN) and American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) recommend germline genetic testing for
all patients with PDAC. However, the best ways to perform this testing and use the resulting information
remain unclear. As genetic testing becomes more common, critical questions need to be addressed: the
number of genes to test; whether testing causes patient distress; and the benefit of PDAC screening in healthy
mutation carriers. Answering these questions will maximize the benefit of genetic testing while minimizing the
risks of over-testing, over-screening, and inefficient use of resources.
My goal is to reduce the burden of pancreatic cancer by identifying optimal ways to execute germline genetic
testing in patients with PDAC and act on the information gained. To accomplish this goal, I will develop a
mathematical model that simulates patient genetic testing and resulting treatment selection, as well as family
member notification, genetic testing, and PDAC screening (Aim 1). I will conduct patient surveys to expand our
understanding of patient distress associated with genetic testing and communication of results to family
members (Aim 2.1). I will use the model and insights gained to determine the timing and breadth of genetic
testing that will optimize life expectancy for patients and family members (Aim 2.2). Finally, I will conduct a
cost-effectiveness analysis of germline genetic testing in PDAC that takes into account diagnosis, treatment,
and family genetic testing in an innovative structure (Aim 3). This will allow me to identify effective and high-
value genetic testing strategies for patients with PDAC, including benefits to patients and their family members.
Completion of this project will be a critical step towards my goal of becoming an independent clinician-scientist
focused in disease modeling, genetic testing, and cancer outcomes research. In addition to my ongoing role
as a clinician and teacher, I will undertake an educational program that has been specifically designed to
support this project and my career goals. I have assembled a mentorship team with unique strengths in cancer
modeling, cancer genetics, and pancreatic cancer research, all of whom are strong, independent investigators
who can guide my career development. This award will provide critical support to allow me to broaden my
knowledge base, leverage the expertise of a senior mentorship team, secure independent R01 funding, and
support my transition to independence in the years to come.

Adipose tissue is a central player in energy balance and glucose homeostasis, it is able to expand in the face of
caloric overload in order to store energy safely, but it can become overloaded and dysfunctional, leading to
systemic metabolic compromise in the form of insulin resistance and Type 2 diabetes. To investigate differences
in individual cell types in lean and obese individuals, I have performed single nucleus RNA sequencing (sNuc-
seq) on human subcutaneous and visceral white adipose tissue and created an atlas of cell types present in
white adipose tissue. A major finding from this work was the identification of distinct subpopulations of
adipocytes, some of which are associated with body mass index (BMI). By associating our data with genome-
wide association studies (GWAS) for metabolic traits such as T2D, we additionally predict that some adipocyte
subpopulations are associated with metabolic disease. The objective of this project is to identify factors that
predispose one subpopulation over another, both externally as well as transcriptionally. To do this I will perform
sNuc-seq on adipose tissue collected from subjects during and post-bariatric surgery in order to characterize the
change in adipocyte subpopulation during weight loss. I will next interrogate the chromatin state of adipocyte
subpoulations by performing the Assay for Transposase Accessible Chromatin on single nuclei from adipose
tissue of lean and obese individuals. Finally, I will directly test potential signaling and transcriptional regulators
of subpopulation identity by performing a screen of potential signaling regulators as well as a CRISPRa screen
of potential transcriptional regulators to try to recapitulate distinct subpopulations in vitro. The experience that I
have in characterizing adipose tissue at single cell resolution, as well as the experience of my mentor and co-
mentor in studying transcriptional and genetic regulation of adipocytes make me uniquely positioned to answer
these questions. Taken together, these studies will enhance our knowledge of human white adipocyte diversity
and will set the stage for downstream studies in my own independent lab and in the community at large.

biomarkers and their association with health and disease. Dr. Cruz’s research interests primarily focus on
historically understudied groups and understanding how varied genetic ancestry plays a role in disease
pathogenesis. African Americans suffer disproportionately from many chronic diseases and in particular
cardiovascular disease. African Americans have also not been included in many cardiovascular studies, raising
the possibility that some results may not be applicable to them. Compounding these issues is the fact that
traditional genetic analyses are not designed to account for the relatively complex genetic makeup that African
Americans have, due to their African ancestry and admixture with other populations. This project aims to
identify the circulating metabolites that are associated with coronary heart disease, investigate the portions of
the genome that are of African continental origin, and use this correlation to identify specific genes that are
associated both with African ancestry and coronary heart disease. Through intensive laboratory and didactic
training in metabolomics and genetics, Dr. Cruz will harness the resources of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical
Center, Harvard Medical School, and associated institutions to examine a disease of significant societal
impact. Situated in a multi-disciplinary laboratory, Dr. Cruz will take advantage of novel metabolomic
technologies and novel genetic analytical strategies to better decipher how genetic ancestry influences levels
of circulating metabolites. He will use admixture mapping techniques, which take into account the
heterogeneous genomic make up of African Americans, to better understand how the unique genomic
structure of recently admixed populations may influence baseline circulating levels of metabolites. Using
plasma samples from African American participants of the Jackson Heart Study and Multi-Ethnic Study of
Atherosclerosis, metabolomics will be used to measure levels of circulating metabolites and assess which
metabolites are associated with incident coronary heart disease, with over 15 years of follow up. Clinical traits
associated with coronary heart disease like, diabetes, hypertension, obesity, and hyperlipidemia will also be
analyzed. Using admixture mapping, regions of potential association between the metabolites of interest and
African ancestry in the genome will be identified, allowing for higher power in identifying specific associated
variants in those regions. As precision medicine offers the promise of more personalized care, it is incumbent
on the biomedical research community to take into account the unique genetic makeup of all members of
society. This project aims to offer specific pathophysiologic information for a historically understudied group of
people. Ultimately Dr. Cruz intends on using his research efforts to provide better medical care to understudied
and underserved populations, and in turn improve the health of society as a whole.

 Interoception, the sensing of signals from internal organs, is crucial to achieving homeostasis in
unpredictable environments. For instance, appropriate food intake relies on accurate estimation of future
energy balance, which in turn relies on gastrointestinal (GI) signals like nutrient content or stomach stretch. A
key brain area that assesses visceral state is the lateral parabrachial nucleus (LPBN) in the brainstem. Visceral
information is routed to the LPBN by several convergent pathways, including the nucleus of the solitary tract
(NTS), which relays signals from vagal afferents to LPBN. Despite this anatomical roadmap, we lack a
comprehensive picture of the functional architecture and GI sensory preferences in the LPBN and its NTS
inputs. This information is crucial to understanding how representations of body signals associated
with fasted, fed, and feeding states are formed, and how they regulate energy balance. To address this
gap in knowledge, I propose to assess the functional organization of GI representations and their relation to
natural feeding. I will further test if specific NTS cell types mediate the relay of these visceral signals to the
LPBN. I will accomplish these aims with a novel method of two-photon imaging in the hindbrain that tracks
hundreds of LPBN neurons across days. In Aim 1, I will measure visceral sensory preferences in the LPBN in
response to mechanical stimulation and nutrient delivery across regions of the GI tract. These measurements
will allow me to determine the spatial organization of LPBN, including testing the presence of a viscerotopic
map of internal organs. Next, I will relate these recordings to activity in the LPBN during ingestion, visceral
malaise, and across fasted and fed states. I will test the hypothesis that a wave of neural activation in LPBN
across many seconds during natural feeding tracks a putative map of the GI tract. In Aim 2, I will determine
how specific inputs from the NTS contribute to feeding-related and satiety state-related activity in LPBN.
Specifically, I will repeat the stimuli of Aim 1 while recording from calcitonin receptor-expressing (Calcr)
neurons of the NTS that have been shown to signal physiological satiety. I will measure when individual axons
of these inputs to LPBN (CalcrNTS->PBN) are active, as well as record LPBN responses to the above stimuli while
CalcrNTS->PBN axons are silenced. These experiments will demonstrate how a key pathway relays GI state and
other satiety information to the LPBN to regulate behavior and interoception. The proposed research will lay
the groundwork for understanding how interoceptive signals from the GI tract lead to satiety sensations,
influence feeding behaviors, and ultimately regulate energy balance. This knowledge will pave the way for
future efforts combining in vivo imaging with spatial transcriptomics to identify specific cell types and
subregions within the LPBN as therapeutic targets for obesity and other metabolic disorders.

The proposed study is a five-year career development research plan that focuses on dissecting the epigenetic
regulation of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) degeneration and regeneration in mouse models of optic nerve crush
and glaucoma. The candidate is currently a postdoctoral research fellow at F.M. Kirby Neurobiology Center at
Boston Children’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School. The candidate intends to further extend his expertise
in epigenomic profiling technologies, mechanisms of optic neuropathies and development of neural regenerative
therapeutics by integrating the mentor team of Dr. Zhigang He at Boston Children’s Hospital and Harvard Medical
School, Dr. Joshua Sanes at Harvard University and Harvard Brain Science Initiative, Dr. Jeffery Goldberg at
Stanford University and Byers Eye Institute, and Dr. Jason Buenrostro at Harvard Stem Cell and Regenerative
Biology (SCRB) Department and Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard. The candidate has also recruited Dr. Daniel
Geschwind, a collaborator of his current and proposed studies, as his advisor for specific scientific and technical
support. The proposed experiments and training activities will enable the candidate to publish top-tier
ophthalmology research works and uniquely position him as an independent principal investigator pursuing novel
therapeutics for retinal disease such as glaucoma.
Glaucoma is the second leading cause of blindness in the United States with at least 3,000,000 people affected.
This number is likely to increase by 60% by 2030 if no new therapeutics could be developped. Due to the inablity
of central nervous system to regenerate after injury, the vision loss resulted from RGC death is irreversible and
will lead to permanent blindness. Our preliminary experiments using the CRISPR/Cas9-based in vivo forward
genetic screen have discovered that the knockdown of injury induced epigenetic regulators, such as CCCTC-
binding factor (CTCF), can robustly promote RGC axonal regeneration or/and survival. To explore the underlying
epigenetic mechanisms regulating RGC survival and regeneration, the proposed study will specifically pursue
the following aims: (1) To profile injury-induced chromatin remodeling in RGCs by ATAC sequencing (mentored
phase); (2) To assess the mechanisms that mediate differential effects of survival and regeneration regulators
upon injury (mentored and independent phase); and (3) To assess the mechanisms and effects of epigenetic
regulators in a glaucoma model (independent phase). For the past two years during this K99 award, I have
successfully accomplished all experiments and goals in Aim 1 and Aim2, with two manuscripts published on
Neuron in 2022 (and selected as cover story). For the extended period of my K award, I will further pursue the
translational study of my approaches in glaucoma relevant mouse models. The outcome of the proposed study
will provide in-depth and quantitative insights into why and how the regenerative fates of RGCs are pre-
determined from an epigenomic perspective, which can be directly transformed to new cures for optic
neuropathies.

Psychotic disorders including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and related illnesses are severe, debilitating, and
often fatal. Cognitive impairments in psychosis are among the leading predictors of disability and poor quality
of life; despite this, there are no first line interventions to target these symptoms. Neuroimaging correlates of
cognitive impairment in psychosis have been identified using fMRI techniques; however, these studies are
mostly correlational in nature, limiting application of these findings to intervention. In order to develop targeted
cognitive interventions, there is an urgent need to 1) identify neural circuits that are causally linked to cognitive
function, and 2) demonstrate that circuits are modifiable and that circuit-level change is associated with
cognitive change. This project is a renewal of a R01 funded multi-year, multi-PI plan to identify the circuit basis
of medication refractory symptoms of psychotic disorders. With NIMH support we found that cerebellar-cortical
functional connectivity is linked to both psychotic symptoms (hallucinations) and negative symptoms of
schizophrenia. Functional connectivity can be engaged and manipulated non-invasively using neuromodulation
techniques such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). The combination of TMS and longitudinal imaging
can help establish causal links between circuits and cognition. In the current project we have identified distinct
cortical-cerebellar circuits linked to cognitive deficits in psychosis and its prodrome. We replicated this finding
and have pilot data that this circuit can be successfully engaged using rTMS. Thus, the goals of this project are
1) to test whether neural circuit dysfunction is dynamically and causally associated with cognitive impairments
in people with psychotic disorders, and 2) to test whether TMS drives dynamic change in both neural circuitry
and cognitive performance. We hypothesize that the relationship between circuit connectivity and cognition
reflects dynamic states intra-individually and over time. Additionally, we hypothesize that the connectivity state
of this circuit is modifiable by TMS and that circuit manipulation will result in cognitive change. The PIs have
expertise in cognition and imaging in psychosis and the fMRI-guided TMS protocols proposed here, including
successful engagement of cerebellar-cortical targets, as well as access to the equipment and resources
necessary to carry out the study. If our hypotheses are supported, we will have identified an actionable target
that can be immediately deployed in intervention trials to test the potential for fMRI-guided TMS to drive
enduring change in cognitive circuitry and performance in psychosis.

During the initial funding period, we applied aptamer-based proteomic analysis (SomaLogic) to investigate
cardiometabolic disease among African Americans (AAs) in the Jackson Heart Study (JHS). In published studies,
we identified novel biomarkers that are associated with the development of left ventricular hypertrophy, CHF and
with CKD over a decade before the onset of clinical disease, including plasma proteins that are differentially
associated with outcomes in individuals of predominantly African vs. European ancestry. We also described how
whole genome sequence analysis of the plasma proteome in individuals with African ancestry increases our
power to detect novel genetic determinants. In addition to identifying over 100 new locus-protein associations,
the associations suggest new mechanisms of genetically mediated diseases linked to African ancestry. We
identified a novel association between variants in APOL1 and the protein CKAP2, as well as an association
between ATTR amyloidosis and RBP4 levels in community dwelling individuals without CHF.
In unpublished work, we have also identified novel determinants of incident CHD, including Secreted
Transmembrane Protein 1 (SECTM1), a poorly characterized protein with potential chemotactic activity for
monocytes. In follow-up in silico analyses, SNPs associated with circulating SECTM1 levels are also associated
with the monocyte percentage of white blood cells in large human databases. Further, our pilot experiments in
mice demonstrate that short term administration of recombinant SECTM1a (mouse homologue) increases pro-
atherogenic and inflammatory Ly6Chi circulating monocytes, as well as monocyte progenitors in the bone
marrow. These data suggest that SECTM1 may be a novel regulator of monocyte biology that contributes to
CHD. More broadly, we have shown that large-scale proteomic profiling in well-characterized populations can
identify proteins and pathways that may be causal for adverse cardiometabolic conditions.
In this renewal, we will first extend our discovery efforts of novel biomarkers of incident CHD and its risk factors
using the recently expanded, highly specific Olink 3,000-plex platform (Aim 1), which includes >2100 proteins
that have not been assayed in a large number of AAs. In Aim 2, fine mapping of protein-associated genetic
variants, co-localization studies with established CHD-associated variants, and Mendelian Randomization
experiments will be used to assess causality of protein-associated variants for CHD, CKD, and other
cardiometabolic conditions. For both Aims 1 & 2, findings will be replicated in a multi-ethnic population (MESA),
and extended through multi-omic analyses involving extensive metabolomic data available in both JHS and
MESA. Putative causal variants that emerge from these analyses will be validated in model systems in Aim 3,
with initial studies focusing on SECTM1’s atherogenic potential in mouse models. In addition to SECTM1, we
anticipate follow-up investigations of two other proteins highlighted by our discovery work. All data from this multi-
institutional collaboration will be made publicly available in real time for the entire scientific community.

SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assays, one of the two major testing modalities used for diagnosis of COVID-19, are
inherently quantitative. This has led to use of cycle threshold values for determining (a) if a tested individual
remains infectious; (b) whether therapeutic approaches are working in immunocompromised patients; (c)
whether a specific illness is more or less likely to be a result of SARS-CoV-2 infection or some other cause; and
(d) whether a positive PCR test represents a current infection or prolonged detection of residual SARS-CoV-2
RNA that may linger for months after an original infection. Cycle threshold (Ct) values are the first cycle during
PCR amplification during which fluorescence signal crosses a reliable instrument detection threshold.
Unfortunately, Ct values are both assay and instrument specific. In fact, for any given Ct value, viral loads (the
amount of virus in a nasal or nasopharyngeal sample) may vary over one thousand-fold depending on the testing
platform. Traditionally, quantitative PCR assays are calibrated with standards which allow conversion of a test
method-dependent Ct value to a test method-independent viral load. The latter directly reflects the amount of
virus in a sample. Therefore, there is strong impetus to develop calibrators covering the billion-fold range of viral
loads observed in COVID-19 infected individuals. Furthermore, these calibrators should be inexpensive and
accessible to diagnostic and research laboratories. However, currently available calibration standards are very
expensive, available in small quantities, labile, and/or do not reflect the higher viral load levels that identify
infectious individuals and signify ongoing infection in immunocompromised patients. Therefore, here we propose
to develop calibrators that address these needs. We identified the positive-strand RNA Qb bacteriophage as a
compelling vector in which to clone SARS-CoV-2 PCR target sequence for calibrator development. Importantly,
as an encapsidated single-strand RNA calibrator, such Qb derivatives will be able to assess inefficiencies in
extraction, reverse transcription, and amplification phases of PCR tests; are inherently stable; and can be grown
to high titers that encompass the upper range of viral loads observed in specimens. The proposal will examine
the ability of the Qb to tolerate heterologous SARS-CoV-2 PCR target sequence inserted into Qb A1 and RNA-
dependent RNA polymerase genes with or without complementation of phage functionality in trans. Lastly, we
will validate calibrators through interrogation of two major commercial platform diagnostic SARS-CoV-2 PCR
assays, and, as proof-of-principle, use these calibrators as a tool to establish their comparative analytical
measurement range and limit of detection. Taken together, we will establish a new set of inexpensive, readily
available reagents for use by the clinical and scientific community to enhance standardization and rigor of data
available from SARS-CoV-2 PCR diagnostics.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress play key roles in Parkinson’s disease (PD). PGC-1α is a master
regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis and antioxidant defenses. PGC-1α deficiency plays a key role in
dopaminergic (DA) neuronal survival, including vulnerability to α-synuclein (αSyn) toxicity, and also potentially in
Alzheimer’s disease. However, viral vector mediated overexpression of PGC-1α at high levels causes DA
neurons to degenerate and increases susceptibility to MPTP toxicity. Thus, harnessing the therapeutic potential
of PGC-1α likely requires normalization (or only mild elevation) of its expression levels in neurons. Achieving this
requires a better understanding of mechanisms regulating PGC-1α. We hypothesize that chaperone-mediated
autophagy (CMA) regulates PGC-1α indirectly by regulating FBW7, a multi-subunit E3 ubiquitin ligase that
promotes the degradation of critical regulatory proteins, including PGC-1α. We have found that SCFFBW7 harbors
the perfect CMA consensus sequence, “KFERQ”, and that increasing CMA decreases FBW7 and increases
PGC-1α protein levels. We hypothesize that CMA degrades FBW7, thus reducing UPS-mediated degradation of
PGC-1α:
↑CMA  ↓ FBW7  ↑ PGC-1α
. FBW7 is a target of PRKN, with Prkn loss leading to increased FBW7
in Prkn-null mice, which in turn reduces levels of the anti-apoptotic factor Mcl-1. Furthermore, brain FBW7 levels
are increased in PD patients with PRKN mutations. Thus, FBW7 is a potential therapeutic target in PD, but our
understanding of mechanisms regulating FBW7 is limited. To this end, we have preliminary data implicating that
p300/SIRT1 dependent regulation of FBW7 acetylation plays a potentially key role in regulating FBW7 levels.
p300/SIRT1 also interact directly with PGC-1α, and thus may represent a homeostatic mechanism for
maintaining stable levels of PGC-1α activity. We now propose first to analyze molecular mechanisms that
regulate FBW7 and PGC-1α, and then will specifically test our hypothesis that reducing SCFFBW7 in DA neurons
will protect against αSyn toxicity in a mouse model of PD.

The Na+/K+/2Cl- co-transporter (NKCC2) is the main sodium transporter in the medullary thick ascending limb
(mTAL), and enhanced activity of NKCC2 has been linked to hypertension in animal models and humans. We
recently found mutant ACTN4—a cytoskeletal protein previously known to contribute to human podocyte
dysfunction and glomerular disease—leads to salt sensitive hypertension in a novel rat model. ACTN4 is
expressed in mTAL, and we found in our new adaptation of organ-on-chip technology, mTAL-on-chips, that
mutant ACTN4 contributes to increased sodium uptake within mTAL cells via enhancing NKCC2 activity. Our
long-term goal is to define the role of ACTN4 in regulating sodium homeostasis and blood pressure salt
sensitivity. The overall objective of this application is to determine the degree to which disease-causing mutant
ACTN4 influences sodium handling in mTAL. Our central hypothesis is that mutant ACTN4 alters the F-actin
cytoskeletal network, which in turn disrupts normal trafficking of NKCC2 within mTAL cells. This disruption of
trafficking leads to accumulation of NKCC2 on the apical membrane of mTAL cells, elevated sodium reabsorption
in mTAL, and ultimately salt-sensitive hypertension. Aim 1 will determine the degree to which mutant ACTN4
increases salt-sensitivity in mTAL cells. We will use mTAL-on-chips seeded with wild type (WT) mTAL cells and
mutant ACTN4 mTAL cells. We will measure sodium reabsorption of mTAL cells in response to varying levels of
stress, including increasing sodium concentration, shear stress, and stretch. Aim 2 will elucidate the mechanism
by which mutant ACTN4 disrupts NKCC2 trafficking. We will measure differences between WT mTAL and mutant
ACTN4 mTAL cells in (1) the cell surface NKCC2 levels and (2) NKCC2 trafficking (endocytosis and exocytosis).
We will further measure whether these differences are amplified in response to varying levels of stress. Aim 3
will ascertain whether in vivo salt-sensitive hypertension associated with mutant ACTN4 is mediated by NKCC2.
We will examine the effect of mutant ACTN4 on pressure natriuresis. We will also assess the effect of inhibiting
NKCC2 with furosemide on acute natriuresis and blood pressure salt-sensitivity. The research proposed in this
application is innovative in that it integrates the novel mTAL-on-chip technology with advanced imaging and
whole animal physiologic studies to comprehensively delineate the mechanism by which mutant ACTN4 leads
to salt-sensitive hypertension. This research will provide strong evidence of a novel and essential mechanism of
sodium and blood pressure regulation performed by the cytoskeletal protein ACTN4.

coupling of bladder smooth muscle (BSM), making it an attractive drug target for the treatment of lower urinary
tract symptoms (LUTS). Nifedipine, a Cav1.2 antagonist, inhibits BSM contraction. However, trials of nifedipine
and other calcium channel blockers (CCBs) for LUTS patients were unsuccessful. On the contrary,
cardiologists and epidemiologists have consistently reported that intake of CCBs like nifedipine causes higher
voiding frequency and worsen the severity of LUTS in patients. The mechanism of this mystery has never been
answered, which hampers its application as a useful drug target for LUTS treatment. We have discovered that
ketamine functions as a Cav1.2 antagonist to cause ketamine cystitis - a painful bladder syndrome presenting
as frequency, small voids, and incontinence. We have discovered that intravesical infusion of nifedipine or
ketamine directly induces voiding frequency in mice. Conversely, Cav1.2 agonist induces fewer but larger
voids, suggesting Cav1.2 agonists as potential novel therapeutics for LUTS. In addition to BSM, we have
further discovered the presence of Cav1.2 in urothelium, and urothelial specific deletion of Cav1.2 (UCav1.2-/-)
in mice results in dramatic voiding frequency, small bladder capacity, and diminished voiding efficiency, a
phenotype closely resembles that produced by intravesical infusion of nifedipine in mice, and the symptoms of
patients with ketamine cystitis or CCB users, indicating a crucial role of Cav1.2 in urothelial function and
bladder pathology. We propose that disruption of Cav1.2 signaling causes deficient urothelial exocytosis and
reduced bladder capacity, which leads to abnormal mechanosensation by elevated ATP signaling and result in
voiding frequency. We will test our hypothesis by the following two aims: Aim 1. We will define bladder storage
abnormality in UCav1.2-/- mice by studying Cav1.2 regulated umbrella cell (UC) exocytosis. We will use
videocystometry and electrophysiology to determine UC exocytosis and bladder urodynamics, and test its
Cav1.2- and AC-cAMP-PKA- dependence. We will further manipulate Cav1.2 expression by gene silence or
knockin specifically in UCs, to determine whether it can rescue the voiding abnormalities observed in UCav1.2-
/- mice or induces a phenotype resembling UCav1.2-/- in wild type mice. Aim 2. We will define urothelial
mechanosensory/voiding abnormality in UCav1.2-/- mice. We will test whether mechanosensation is altered in
UCav1.2-/- mice by abnormal urothelial ATP signaling. We will further test whether elevated urothelial ATP
signaling by ablation of ATP hydrolase Entpd3 in urothelium leads to voiding frequency as proposed in
UCav1.2-/- mice. In brief, our data indicate a crucial role of Cav1.2 in regulating bladder storage and voiding
function, supporting a novel mechanism on urothelial Cav1.2-mediated exocytosis and ATP signaling. A
complete understanding of this mechanism should answer the longstanding question of why Cav1.2
antagonists are of no benefit for LUTS patients, and potentially leads to novel therapeutics for LUTS treatment.

 Recent innovations by project investigators have established an important new framework for sustaining
the anti-thrombotic properties of blood contacting films in order to improve the clinical performance of a variety of
implanted cardiovascular devices. Notably, we have discovered highly active, orthogonal sortase mutants that
recognize unique peptide sorting motifs, enabling repeated covalent assembly and disassembly of surface
bound biomolecular constituents, thereby providing a means to regenerate anti-thrombotic constituents on blood
contacting films after device implantation. While precedent exists for the therapeutic use of foreign proteins,
recent innovations by project collaborators have also led to the development of novel computational and
experimental tools for protein deimmunization to mitigate any immunogenic risk that may be associated with
sortase-derived enzymes. Importantly, we have also developed new chemoenzymatic schemes leading to the
discovery of a synthetic heparin that is resistant to heparanase mediated biodegradation, forming the basis of a
novel family of highly durable heparin thin films. These breakthroughs offer an opportunity to extend the lifetime
of a bioactive film with commensurate improvements in clinical outcomes. In this proposal we intend to:
(1) Design synthetic heparins that are resistant to heparanase and characterize their capacity to limit
thrombus formation as a component of a ‘rechargeable’ thin film. Chemoenzymatic and orthogonal ligation
schemes will be used to generate synthetic heparins that are resistant to heparanase mediated biodegradation.
In addition to characterizing the biostability of these new heparin analogues, anticoagulant activity will be
determined, and pharmacokinetic properties defined. The rechargeability of thin films comprised of synthetic
heparin analogues will be evaluated in vitro and after extended blood-contacting periods in vivo.
(2) Design functionally deimmunized sortase variants to facilitate in situ recharging of bioactive thin
films through deletion of immunogenic T cell epitopes. The cellular immunogenicity of a pentamutant
sortase variant, eSrtALPETG, will be assessed and T cell epitopes driving the response mapped in naïve human
peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Computational tools will be used to design functionally deimmunized
candidate eSrtALPETG variants, which will be evaluated for their maintenance of transpeptidation activity and their
reduction of cellular immunogenicity. Lead candidates will be assessed in humanized HLA transgenic mice.
(3) Synthesize and characterize blood contacting thin films that enable selective and repetitive
regeneration of multiple bioactive constituents that inhibit thrombin generation. In the first phase of these
investigations, we plan to define the capacity of deimmunized sortase variants to facilitate the fabrication of
rechargeable, multicomponent bioactive thin films that contain both synthetic heparin and recombinant
thrombomodulin. During the second phase, we will define the ability of an anti-thrombogenic thin film containing
multiple rechargeable bioactive constituents to extend the patency of a small diameter vascular graft.

While cancer cachexia is a devastating syndrome characterized by progressive muscle wasting, inflammation,
and metabolic disruption, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly characterized. There are currently no
treatments for cachexia. Cancer cachexia is driven by systemic inflammation, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and
apoptosis (“cellular debris”). A paradigm shift is emerging in understanding the resolution of inflammation as an
active biochemical process with our discovery of novel specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs), such as
resolvins and endogenous resolution programs. SPMs stimulate macrophage-mediated clearance of debris,
promote tissue/muscle regeneration, and counter-regulate pro-inflammatory cytokines at nanogram doses
without immunosuppression. Despite approaches to block systemic inflammation, there are no current “pro-
resolving” therapies in cancer or cancer cachexia. Moreover, the impact of cancer cachexia on eicosanoids
and the novel pro-resolving lipid mediators, both key endogenous regulators of initiation and resolution of
inflammation, are unknown. This proposal builds on our recent finding that stimulating resolution of inflamma-
tion prevents tumor growth by counter-regulating pro-inflammatory cytokines/eicosanoids and clearing debris.
Therefore, the overarching theme is to elucidate the underlying processes of failed resolution of inflamma-
tion that drive cancer cachexia. We will rely on a set of established experimental systems, including genetic
and pharmacological manipulation of SPMs and their receptors in animal models and macrophages. We shall
test this in a multi-pronged approach. In Specific Aim 1, the mechanisms of dysregulated resolution of in-
flammation in cachexia will be investigated. We will profile lipid autacoid mediators, including eicosanoids and
SPMs, to test our innovative hypothesis that failed resolution of inflammation is necessary and sufficient
to cause cachexia, which induces a rapid eicosanoid storm with dysregulated SPMs that leads to an un-
controlled cytokine storm. We will evaluate pro-resolving lipid mediators as interventional targets in ca-
chexia. In Specific Aim 2, we will optimize the delivery of SPM mimetics and humanized nano-pro-
resolving medicines (NPRMs) carrying SPM cargo to cachectic tissues and determine whether SPMs can
prevent chemotherapy-induced cachexia. These studies will complement Specific Aim 3, which seeks to pre-
vent cancer cachexia via stimulation of resolution by precision nutrition. Parabiosis studies will determine
whether cancer-induced cachexia is caused by an effect on the primary tumor or the metastatic site as most
patients with cachexia die from metastases. These studies can offer a new animal system to evaluate cachexia
at an early stage. We will connect our preclinical findings to clinical disease phenotypes using a computational
framework to understand failed inflammation resolution in cachexia. Since SPMs have proven safe and effec-
tive in human inflammatory disorders, these studies shall provide the basis for rapid translation of resolution-
directed treatments in humans as a new direction to potentially prevent and/or reverse cancer cachexia.

By age 75, individuals sleep about 1.5 hr. less per night, take longer to fall asleep, wake up more frequently at
night and are more likely to nap during the day than at age 25. Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease/Lewy
body dementia, and fronto-temporal lobe dementia exacerbate these problems. We hypothesize that the
changes in wake-sleep and circadian behavior during aging are due to subclinical neurodegeneration
of wake-sleep and circadian circuitry as a continuous process during aging. This would be similar to
REM sleep behavior disorder, which often occurs 10-15 years before a diagnosable synucleinopathy. We
further hypothesize that different neurodegenerative disorders may affect different patterns of wake-
sleep and circadian cell groups and cause different behavioral changes. If this hypothesis is correct, it
may be possible to use specific sleep and circadian disturbances as biomarkers to identify early, preclinical
stages of these disorders. We propose here to test these hypotheses using two unique sets of subjects from
the Rush Memory and Aging cohorts, who have actigraphic recording of rest-activity behaviors. In the first set
of subjects, who have had actigraphy within one year of death and a brain autopsy, we will analyze the
actigraphy for sleep time, sleep fragmentation, and sleep efficiency during the night, nap time during the day,
and circadian activity phase and amplitude. We expect to find that cell loss will be associated with
deposition of pathological proteins in wake-sleep and circadian cell groups, and specific patterns of
wake-sleep and circadian behavioral deficits, even if there was no diagnosable neurodegenerative
disorder during life. In Aim 1, we will look at wake-promoting (orexin, tuberomammillary, A10, raphe,
pedunculopontine, parabrachial, and locus coeruleus), sleep promoting (ventrolateral preoptic, MCH), and
circadian (suprachiasmatic vasopressin and VIP neurons) cell groups for association between deposition of
neurodegenerative pathological protein deposits (beta-amyloid, phospho-tau, phospho-α-synuclein, phospho-
TDP-43) and reduced numbers of surviving neurons. In Aim 2, we will look for association of changes in sleep
time, efficiency, fragmentation, and napping, as well as changes in circadian amplitude or phase with numbers
of remaining neurons and deposition of neurodegenerative proteins in the same cell groups as Aim 1. In Aim
3, we will test a separate validation cohort of patients who had actigraphy 2 or more years prior to death and
clinical and pathological diagnosis at the time of death, to determine whether specific wake-sleep or circadian
deficits predict later neurodegenerative diagnoses. We hope to be able to identify patterns of wake-sleep
and circadian deficits during life using actigraphy, an inexpensive, non-invasive, and widely available
tool, that predict and act as biomarkers for subclinical presence of Alzheimer’s disease and other
neurodegenerative disorders, similar to the relationship of REM sleep behavior disorder and
synucleinopathies.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Overall Abstract
Little is known about the pathogenesis of lupus nephritis (LN), particularly as it relates to the initiation and
propagation of the inflammatory response which accounts for the development or end stage renal disease. LN
may complicate up to two thirds of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus with higher rates commonly
seen among minorities and children. Besides the needle kidney biopsy, we lack tools that reflect tissue
pathology with fidelity. Although two drugs have been recently approved to treat patients with LN, all treatment
protocols involve systemic administration of drugs or biologics which are laden with side effects and limited
clinical efficacy. Ample evidence has revealed that kidney resident cells and newly formed high endothelial
venules in the presence of an autoinflammatory environment, upregulate molecules which account for the
ensuing inflammation and cell damage, while in their absence, kidney damage is averted. These molecular
changes can be recorded in parallel in podocytes and tubular epithelial cells in the urine. This proposal will
test the hypothesis that interaction of constituents of the immune system with kidney resident cells and the
ectopically formed high endothelial venules, determines the development of inflammation and injury in the
setting of LN. Corollaries of this hypothesis are that kidney resident cells can serve as gateways for the
administration of targeted therapeutics for the treatment of LN and that kidney tissue pathology can be
recorded with high fidelity in the urine cells of patients with LN. There are 2 projects in this proposal: 1)
Interplay between autoimmune effectors and kidney resident cells in lupus nephritis and 2) Newly formed high
endothelial cells in the kidney- pathogenesis and implications in lupus nephritis. The proposal will be supported
by 3 cores: The Administrative Core will be responsible for regulatory compliance, budget management,
scheduling meetings. The Nanoparticle Immune Delivery Core will be responsible for the construction of
nanoparticles loaded with drugs and biologics and tagged with antibodies for cell-specific delivery. The Single
Cell, Spatial Transcriptomics and Bioinformatics Core will perform single cell transcriptomics studies and will
provide statistical and bioinformatics support. This proposal through extensive synergistic plans between the
project leaders brings forward novel and significant elements in the study of the pathogenesis, treatment and
biomarker development in patients with LN.

Tight regulation of circulating nutrients within a narrow physiological range is a critical function of metabolism,
and eating is a regular perturbation of this homeostasis. Growing evidence suggests that changes in circulating
metabolites after a standardized mixed meal tolerance test (MMTT) may reflect underlying cardiometabolic
(CM) health beyond what is revealed during fasting. Thus far, there have been very few broad
characterizations of metabolomic changes after a standardized meal in a large cohort of community-dwelling
individuals with a range of CM risk. In recently published human data, the applicant identified >30 circulating
metabolites whose 2-hour changes after a MMTT are different in people with diabetes vs. those without even
after accounting for fasting differences. A subset of these metabolites is associated with premature death in a
large population-based cohort. The applicant will now extend these pilot findings in the Framingham Heart
Study (FHS), where >2,400 participants will undergo a MMTT and metabolomic profiling of ≈800 targeted
metabolites and ≈5,000 unknown compounds by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. We will
test whether specific metabolites’ responses after a MMTT are associated with a range of CM risk factors such
as insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, obesity, and unhealthy diet, and novel glycemic traits by continuous
glucose monitoring (Aim 1). We will then assess broader epidemiologic implications of these post-MMTT
metabolite responses by examining their associations with incident cardiometabolic disease (CMD) in the FHS,
relating their fasting levels to incident diabetes and cardiovascular disease (CVD) in racially and ethnically
diverse external cohorts, and testing whether post-MMTT metabolite responses may be causally related to
CMD by leveraging genetics (Aim 2). Finally, we will translate the paradigm of using a MMTT to assess CM
health from individuals in the community with average CM risk to a hospital-based cohort of individuals with
overt CMD (i.e., heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [HFpEF]). We will assess whether post-MMTT
metabolite responses are related to markers of HFpEF disease status and if post-MMTT metabolite responses
improve after treatment with sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors, which are theorized to improve
outcomes in HFpEF through metabolic modulation (Aim 3). The applicant is an early career investigator and
cardiologist with a research focus on leveraging evolving biochemical profiling techniques in precision nutrition
to improve CVD prevention and treatment. This proposal will further the applicant’s career development
through training in nutrition science, state-of-the-art metabolomics technology, advanced biostatistics and
bioinformatics methods for analyzing metabolomics and genomics data, and the conduct of patient-oriented
research in diverse settings. The applicant’s outstanding mentoring team of senior investigators with
distinguished mentoring records and internationally recognized expertise in nutrition, metabolomics, genetics,
and epidemiology will support the candidate as he transitions to research independence during the award.

Regenerative medicine therapies of various kinds are promising and rapidly growing, both in scale and type.
The therapeutic products are not pills–they are living cells that are harvested from a patient (or sometimes a cell
bank) and are shipped to a pharmaceutical company that modiﬁes the cells and then sends them back to be re-
injected into the patient. Logistics plays an outsize role in this process because the samples need to be
maintained at ultra-low temperatures throughout the shipping process. Because these samples are personalized
to a particular patient, they are not replaceable with something else. If damaged or switched, the outcome will
be dire.
The state-of-the-art shipment technology today is, a dry shipper at liquid nitrogen temperature with a
temperature logger that is physically attached to the dry shipper–but they report the temperature of the shipper,
not the sample so if a sample is removed for inspection, this will not be recorded.
For regenerative medicine therapies to be successful, it is essential that the end-to-end processes of freezing,
storage, and thawing are carried out in strict adherence to precisely deﬁned protocols. Transient warming events
and variability in product temperatures throughout shipping and distribution can negatively affect the samples
and contribute to poor clinical outcomes. Therefore, it is necessary to validate optimized cold chain practices
individually for each sample, to ensure the highest quality therapeutic outcomes.
The goal of this fast-track proposal is to develop a functional pilot product that will provide an on-the-sample,
end to end temperature log before, during, and after shipping. Software will compare user-deﬁned protocol
criteria with the sample temperature record and will provide a go / no-go decision for use of the sample.
The speciﬁc aims of the project are: (a) develop the on-sample electronics that records the temperature history
of the sample along with timestamps with an accuracy of 2 °C, (b) develop the shipper electronics that needs to
operate for 3 days on batteries and record time stamped sample temperatures and transmits that data back to the
sample custodian, and (c) develop a cryogenic container that can keep the sample data acquisition active while
the samples moving around in the lab, and ﬁnally (d) a quality assurance station the can inform the end user if
the sample is viable by checking the sample's temperature record against the criteria set by the protocols for that
sample.

Recent FDA accelerated approvals of two anti-amyloid antibody treatments, aducanumab and lecanemab, for
early-stage Alzheimer’s disease (AD) provide the first disease-modifying treatments to date, albeit with moderate
slowing of cognitive decline, and vascular side effects known as Amyloid Related Imaging Abnormalities due to
edema (ARIA-E) or microhemorrhages (ARIA-H) in ~12-35% of patients, especially ApoE4 carriers. While the
cause of ARIA is unknown, it has been suggested that Ab clearance by anti-amyloid antibodies is mediated by
perivascular drainage which may transiently lead to amyloid accumulating in the blood vessel wall and inducing
inflammation, which in turn may increase BBB breakdown, leading to edema or microhemorrhages (Cogswell et
al., 2022). Therefore, there is still a large unmet need to improve cognitive efficacy and safety of anti-amyloid
immunotherapy. Semaglutide is a Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor (GLP-1R) agonist, that is FDA approved
for the treatment of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and obesity, that has strong anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective and
pro-vascular health effects. Previous studies have shown beneficial effects of semaglutide in stroke models,
diabetes models, LPS models and other disease models. Novo Nordisk, the inventor of semaglutide, is
conducting two large Phase 3a clinical trials to test the efficacy of semaglutide in early-stage AD (EVOKE,
EVOKE+). While other GLP-1R agonists have shown benefits in AD mouse models, semaglutide, a longer lasting
form, has not yet been tested in amyloid AD mouse models. The goal of this project is to determine whether the
combination of semaglutide with anti-amyloid antibody therapy will enhance the efficacy beyond that of either
treatment alone and attenuate the vascular side effects seen with anti-amyloid antibodies. We propose the
following 3 Aims: 1. We hypothesize that semaglutide alone will reduce or reverse inflammation and
neurodegeneration and spare cognition in 2 amyloid AD-like mouse models: 5XE4 mice which overexpress
human mutant APP/PS1 on a human ApoE4/4 background and APPSAA knockin mice which express physiologic
levels of human mutant APP. Mice will be dosed for 12 weeks at 2 ages – pre-plaque and after robust plaque
and vascular amyloid accumulation. 2. We hypothesize that combination therapy with semaglutide and anti-
amyloid antibodies (murine versions of lecanemab and donanemab) will enhance efficacy compared to either
treatment alone in the 5XE4 model which develops abundant plaques, vascular amyloid, inflammation and
cognitive decline with aging. 3. We hypothesize that acute semaglutide co-treatment with a murine precursor to
bapineuzumab (3D6) shown to cause a high amount of ARIA, will mitigate microhemorrhagic side effects in aged
5XE4 mice. Outcomes include behavioral testing, pathological and biochemical measures, bulk RNAseq and in-
depth analysis of transcriptomic changes within cell populations in cortex and hippocampus, and mapping of the
mouse data to human data available on the NIH-sponsored AMP-AD portal. If successful, combination trials in
humans could be initiated to improve the efficacy and safety of anti-amyloid antibody immunotherapy.

 Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the most common cause of dementia, is accompanied by progressive
neurodegeneration and stereotypic deposition of misfolded amyloid β- (Aβ) and tau proteins. However, the
basis for cellular dysfunction in AD is not well understood, underscoring an important need to broaden the
biologic scope of AD research. Technological advances, based on single-cell whole-genome sequencing
(scWGS) on frozen postmortem human brain tissue, now allow examination of previously inaccessible aspects
of the genome of individual cells in the brain. Recent research from our group has found that neurons in
individuals with AD show greater somatic single-nucleotide variants (sSNV) in their genomes than in
individuals without AD. Using mutational signature analysis, our study also found that the specific causes of
somatic mutations differed in AD, implicating oxidative stress and signal suggesting other cytopathologic
events.
 This study aims to understand neuronal somatic mutation in AD at a deeper level, to probe how disease
progression and protein misfolding impact the burden and signatures of sSNV. The first aim will examine
neurons from individuals with different pathologic stages of AD. This will give us a better understanding of
when somatic mutations develop in disease, and whether certain mutagenic events occur with distinct timing in
the development of AD. The second aim will study how intracellular tau pathology relates to somatic mutation,
utilizing a novel method to separate individual nuclei according to tau tangle formation. In applying this method
to specific brain regions at specific pathologic stages at the forefront of AD progression, we will be able to
determine if somatic mutation is tied to tau pathology at the level of individual cells. In the final aim, we will test
whether Aβ trigger somatic mutation, using a human iPSC-derived neuronal cellular model and incubation with
human brain-derived Aβ oligomers.
 With complementary approaches of novel scWGS technology, single-nucleus sorting, and specific human
tissues and and cellular systems, we will examine the mechanistic role of neuronal somatic mutations in AD.
This examination of the interplay between disease progression, protein misfolding, and the landscape of
somatic mutations will be an important step in understanding the molecular causes of AD. Moreover, the
capability of somatic mutational signature analysis to reveal previously unrecognized disease mechanisms
lends additional promise toward development of better treatments and cures.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
 The overall goal of this proposal is to systematically characterize the cellular functions of
transcription factor isoforms. Transcription factors (TFs) are master regulators of gene expression and as
such play key roles in a variety of biological processes, including cell growth and differentiation. The human
genome is estimated to harbor ~1600 TF genes; however, most of these are expressed as a series of protein
isoforms arising from mRNAs with alternative starts, ends, or splicing. Though a handful of alternative TF
isoforms are known to play functionally important (and distinct) roles in the cell, the overwhelming majority—
thousands of proteins—remain entirely uncharacterized. Moreover, splicing aberrations are a hallmark of
cancer, and mis-expression of TF isoforms can contribute to tumorigenesis. Thus, decoding the roles of TF
isoforms is key to a systems-level understanding of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) in development and
disease. In my previous work, I found widespread changes in DNA binding, protein-protein interactions, and
transcriptional activation in exogenous assays across a collection of >700 TF isoforms. These results
underscore the need to perturb and characterize TF isoforms in their endogenous cellular context to truly
understand their roles in GRNs.
 Functional genomics approaches such as high throughput perturbation screens have revolutionized our
understanding of gene functions. I aim to apply and extend these functional genomics approaches to
study isoforms, which have remained elusive due to technical limitations. I propose to use a combination of
state-of-the-art genomic technologies to decode the functions of TF isoforms in breast cancer cells. I will
leverage long read RNA-sequencing to perform rigorous isoform-aware analyses (Aim 1) and isoform-specific
high throughput experiments (Aims 2 and 3). In Aim 1, I will re-analyze existing CRISPR/Cas9 knock-out
databases from the Cancer Dependency Map Consortium to identify candidate isoform-specific phenotypes in
breast cancer. In Aim 2, I will establish a platform for robust and specific knock-down of individual isoforms in
mammalian cells using RNA-targeting CRISPR/Cas systems. In Aim 3, I will use tunable libraries of TF ORFs
to quantitatively tune isoform expression across a range of physiological levels. The proposed work includes
technology development in the mentored K99 phase, which I will then leverage during the independent R00
phase to probe the mechanisms of TF isoform function in breast cancer via single-cell screening approaches.
 Successful execution of these aims will begin to decode the “dark matter” of alternative TF isoforms,
laying a foundation for future studies of alternative isoforms more broadly. By combining new training in high-
throughput screening approaches during the K99 phase with my existing expertise in gene regulation, TF
biology, and bioinformatics, this transition to independence award will position me well to start my own
research group that uses interdisciplinary genomic methods to probe GRNs in development and disease.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Project Summary
Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a heterogeneous condition that occurs most frequently as complicating
comorbidity of very common disease in the western world, including COPD, heart failure, and blood clots in the
lung. In patients with PH secondary to COPD (Group III) mortality risk is about twice as high than in patients with
COPD and normal pulmonary artery pressure. Medications developed successfully for Group I disease have not
shown much utility in Group III PH. Additionally, non-invasive screening and early detection remain challenging.
For this reason, etiology and evolution of PH are still poorly understood and the response to potential
interventions is very difficult to measure.
In recent years, radiologists have been making observation of the loss of distal vasculature (pruning), increased
vascular “tortuosity”, and proximal vascular dilation in patients with PH. In this career development proposal, we
hypothesize that the great power and recent advances in artificial intelligence can be leveraged to identify new
functional and structural markers that define the presence of PH in smokers from non-contrast CT images. These
CT-based features will significantly improve our ability to define the main structural and functional effects of PH
in COPD patients and assess pathological conditions, leading to a better understanding of the genetic and
biological underpinnings of the disease.
Aim 1 of this application involves refining our algorithm for vascular morphology assessment and applying it to
investigate how the pulmonary vasculature is affected in presence of PH Group III. Five markers of presence of
disease will be explored. The goal of Aim 2 is to develop an innovative approach to assess the level of pulmonary
perfusion from non-contrast non cardiac gated CT images and to apply it to explore new functional markers of
disease. Both in Aims 1 and 2 association with biological outcomes will be performed. Finally, in Aim 3 we will
validate the biological relevance of the endpoints determined in Aims 1 and 2 by performing common and rare
variant association studies.
Preliminary data obtained with our published methods show promising results. We show that using artificial
intelligence we can effectively segment pulmonary vessels, separate arteries and veins, and measure small
vessels with an accuracy which outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, we developed an innovative
technique that synthesized perfusion maps from non-contrast CT to assess perfusion defects in PH patients.
Together, the research proposed in the aims of this award will take full advantage of the comprehensive dataset
available through the COPDGene study. The execution of the aims in this proposal will be possible through
active collaboration with Dr. Raul San Jose Estepar, Ph.D. as the mentor and an outstanding Advisory Committee
including renowned leaders in the fields of medical image analysis, translational research, quantitative imaging
in pulmonary vascular disease, and the genetic epidemiology of COPD.

Although neuronavigation systems are of crucial assistance during cerebrovascular surgery, they do not
integrate hemodynamics information needed to treat complex cerebrovascular malformations. The present
project aims at developing an Augmented Reality (AR) neuronavigation tool that will enable the visualization of
cerebral hemodynamics information in the surgical view. Our long-term goal is to contribute toward the
development and clinical adoption of visualization tools that allow for safe and accurate treatment of
cerebrovascular malformations. Our overall objectives in this project are to (i) develop a novel approach based
on deep neural networks that can classify and reconstruct 3D dynamic cerebral vasculature from 2D Digital
Subtraction Angiography (DSA) image series, (ii) compose an AR visualization that will enhance the surgical
view of the brain, and (iii) validate and evaluate our technology in real clinical settings. The rationale for this
project is that such technology will provide a clear and interpretable visualization tool to surgeons that will
support their decision-making process and reduce the time and complex spatial reasoning required to treat
cerebrovascular malformations. To attain the overall objectives, the following three specific aims will be
pursued: 1) develop and validate a method to classify artery and veins in DSA image series to visually
disentangle AVMs, 2) develop and validate a method to build dynamic, virtual 3D model of cerebral vasculature
from pairs of DSA image series and 3) build an AR visualization that aligns DSA image series with the surgical
view and assess its impact providing surgical guidance. In addition, we will examine, through a clinical
retrospective study, and through tests in the operating room on phantom data, the impact of this visualization in
providing surgeons with guidance during cerebrovascular surgery. The proposed project is innovative because
it will be possible to merge the true DSA-derived 3D cerebral hemodynamics with images of the brain surface
seen through a surgical microscope. The proposed project is significant because it will provide visual guidance
and confirmation to surgeons that will facilitate decision-making in the surgical treatment of complex AVMs.
The results are expected to have an important positive impact because they will provide novel neuronavigation
tools to improve the surgical treatment of cerebrovascular malformations and ultimately reduce the risks of
intraoperative hemorrhaging and postsurgical deficits. Furthermore, the methods described here are
cost-effective, adapted to low-resources settings, and can be easily implemented on a large scale, bringing
advanced imaging techniques to far more patients.

The long-term objective of this project is to develop Dr. Romanos-Nanclares’s capacity to conduct studies that
integrate dietary and lifestyle factors with multi-omics data and traditional biomarkers to better understand the
biological pathways underlying the etiology of aggressive forms of breast cancer and to advance the field of
precision nutrition for cancer prevention. The proposed research combines ‘omics methodologies with advanced
statistical techniques to investigate the role of chronic inflammation in the etiology of breast cancer. Chronic
inflammation has been identified as a possible risk factor in the development of breast cancer, including estrogen
receptor negative breast cancer, which is a subtype of breast cancer that is associated with poorer prognosis
and is less responsive to hormonal therapies. The foundation for this proposal is based on our recent findings
where a higher adherence to an Empirical Dietary Inflammatory Pattern (EDIP) score (or a more pro-
inflammatory diet) was associated with increased breast cancer risk, particularly for tumors lacking estrogen
receptor expression. Leveraging the unique design and wealth of resources in the Nurses’ Health Study (NHS)
and Nurses’ Health Study II (NHSII), with repeated dietary measures and prediagnostic plasma specimens, this
application will combine dietary and ‘omics data from multiple biological dimensions with cutting-edge
epidemiological and bioinformatics methodologies to examine the relationship between chronic inflammation and
invasive breast cancer risk and estrogen receptor subtypes. In Aim 1 (K99), she will examine the associations
of plasma metabolomic profiles of EDIP with subsequent risk of breast cancer in the NHS and NHSII among
1,997 cases and their matched controls. In Aim 2 (R00), she will use an agnostic approach to identify the
associations of plasma proteomics with risk of breast cancer in the NHS and NHSII among 200 cases and their
matched controls. In Aim 3 (R00), she will integrate multi-omics data, including metabolomics, proteomics, and
transcriptomics, to characterize the role of inflammation in breast cancer etiology. This research will provide
novel evidence, enhance our understanding of the biological mechanisms involved in breast cancer etiology,
and help identify new prevention strategies for more aggressive forms of the disease. Dr. Romanos-Nanclares’s
scientific aims are supported by three training objectives that will allow her to advance her trajectory toward
becoming an independent investigator: 1) single-omics and multi-omics methodologies and advanced analytics;
2) proteomics study design and execution; and 3) breast cancer etiology and pathophysiology. The training
environment at Brigham and Women’s Hospital will provide exceptional support for Dr. Romanos-Nanclares as
she pursues these development and scientific goals. She has assembled an outstanding interdisciplinary
mentoring team with expertise in cancer epidemiology, multi-omics bioinformatics, breast cancer pathology,
proteomics, and metabolomics. This K99/R00 award will help Dr. Romanos-Nanclares acquire the knowledge
and experience necessary to launch her career as an independent investigator.

The cytokines IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 are thought to be key effectors of airway inflammation, but remarkably
little is known about either their global function within the respiratory tract or the potential consequences of
their complete inhibition by newly available biologic drugs. The overall goal of the proposed research is to
define the underlying human biology of IL-4Rα and IL-5R signaling in airway inflammation, both their role in
driving type 2 inflammation and their role in counterregulating other systemic immune pathways. We will
determine the cell-specific impacts of these cytokines within the respiratory tract and confirm the influence
of IL-4Rα and IL-5R on the chronic inflammation of patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis
(CRSwNP), severe asthma, and aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD). Further, given that some
drugs now available to inhibit these pathways have poorly understood side effects like new-onset joint pain,
we will establish the systemic immunologic consequences of inhibiting a receptor as widely expressed as
IL-4Rα and will identify novel biomarkers to predict those immune responses. In three separate but
interrelated projects, we aim to:
 1. Define the cellular mechanism(s) of anti-IL-4Rα-induced therapeutic benefit in AERD with a
 prospective study of 8 weeks of dupilumab treatment.
 2. Define the systemic immunologic consequences of IL-4Rα inhibition with dupilumab and determine
 which immunologic changes correlate with the development of arthralgias.
 3. Characterize the functional significance of IL-5Rα on upper airway nasal plasma cells and epithelial
 cells, from patients with healthy sinus mucosa, CRSwNP, and AERD.
These goals will be achieved using patient-oriented research (POR), as each of these aims involve patient
interactions and longitudinal study visits to collect and verify clinical outcomes, and through the mentorship
of the next generation of patient-oriented allergic disease investigators. The proposed studies and the
clinical questions to be examined offer outstanding training opportunities for junior investigators interested in
clinically relevant research in allergy and asthma. Dr. Tanya Laidlaw is a recognized investigator in the
causes of CRSwNP and AERD and the candidate's many ongoing POR projects and collaborations,
commitment to and track record of mentorship, along with the exceptional institutional resources, provide a
first-rate environment for the development of junior investigators. Critically, this award will provide Dr.
Laidlaw protected time for POR in airway inflammation and allergic respiratory disease to both refine her
mentoring and leadership skills and expand her expertise to include predictive biomarker identification,
pathway-level multi-omics analysis, and high dimensional data analyses.

Lung diseases exhibit differences between males and females in risk, progression, symptoms,
and response to therapy; rigorous investigation is needed to define the molecular reasons for
these differences. Our previous work has demonstrated that modeling Omics data using gene
regulatory networks can discover key differences driving health and disease. The goal of this K24
is to merge our prior approach to modeling sex differences with mentoring researchers in sex-
and gender-aware data science. Methods will support modelling gender and sex as a
biologic variable using a data science framework, to promote translation of data from the
NHLBI Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine(TOPMed) program to actionable clinical
innovations for COPD. The goal of this Patient Oriented Research program is to mentor trainees
in Omics data science and Network Medicine through a sex and gender lens, which requires not
only considering biology(sex) but societal constructs(gender); to date this approach has been
limited for lung diseases. To advance the dissemination of data analytic approaches for COPD
research, we will focus on sex and gender aware epidemiology, Omic analyses inclusive of X and
Y chromosome data, and gene regulatory network methods. In addition to mentoring and career
development, trainees will pursue the hypothesis that somatic mosaicism on the X chromosome
(mCA X) and loss of Y (LoY) will associate with COPD phenotypes and COPD progression. To
facilitate mentoring, scientific Aims include 1) Investigating whether mCA X and LoY mediate sex
and gender divergent features of COPD and 2) Defining pathway and gene regulatory network
rewiring associated with mCA X and LoY, using single Omic and network-based approaches.
Innovative aspects include the evaluation of gender as well as sex associations with COPD;
investigation of mCA X and LoY and COPD; extension of gene regulatory network approaches to
include somatic mosaicism; and development of a sex- and gender-aware data science toolkit.
Understanding sex and gender differences using tools to integrate Omics and the gene regulatory
landscapes with mCA X and LoY will improve our understanding of COPD and support precision
medicine initiatives. This paradigm shifting K24 will support the training of the next generation of
pulmonary data scientists interested in sex and gender-aware Patient Oriented Research, with
specific application to COPD, a leading cause of death with sex divergent features.

 This K23 application supports Dr. Sheila Hegde, a highly promising cardiac imager and early-stage
investigator who is committed to investigating the underlying mechanisms by which physical activity (PA)
favorably impacts the risk of heart failure (HF) in late-life. Her long-term goal is to be an independent
investigator studying modifiable biomarkers of aging and HF risk that will ultimately inform therapeutic
intervention. The overall scientific objective of this proposal is to identify biologic pathways underlying the
beneficial effects of PA on cardiac function, functional capacity, and HF risk using high dimensional ‘-omic’
data. The main hypothesis is that PA delays age-related changes in cardiac structure and function and
mitigates HF risk through biologic pathways that can be identified through high throughput circulating
proteomic profiling. The specific aims are to: 1) Employ high-throughput plasma proteomics and genomic data
to identify novel molecular pathways underlying longitudinal PA-related changes in cardiovascular structure
and function and incident HF (NHLBI ARIC cohort); and 2) Identify molecular pathways underlying the
beneficial effect of a structured PA intervention on functional capacity with the use of plasma proteomics in
older sedentary adults at high risk of HF. (Brigham and Women’s Hospital-based cohort). These aims will also
serve as a vehicle to achieve the following career and learning objectives: 1) Attain advanced skills in novel,
data science driven methods for high-dimensional data, particularly in proteomics analysis; and 2) Develop the
necessary skills to design, implement, and conduct a clinical trial in order to transition to an independent
clinical investigator. These objectives will be accomplished through: 1) structured interactions with a
committed and expert multidisciplinary panel of mentors and advisors; 2) focused didactic coursework in study
design and statistical approaches relevant to ‘-omic’ data; and 3) progressive participation in multi-institutional
working groups and committees for national multicenter studies, dedicated mini-courses and meetings relevant
to PA and multi ‘-omic’ analyses, and national cardiovascular professional organizations. These activities will
also act as a framework to grow her leadership skills and to develop external collaborations.
 The results of the proposed early career development award will provide further insight into the
underlying cardiovascular mechanisms by which physical activity impacts age-related changes in cardiac
structure and function, functional capacity, and heart failure (HF) risk and serve as the necessary foundation
for Dr. Hegde to transition to an independent investigator.

This NIH K23 proposal details a comprehensive five-year training plan for mentored patient-oriented research
career development and research to address a major problem in neuromuscular medicine. Over half of patients
with clinically suspected Mendelian myopathies do not have a molecular diagnosis, largely due to two challenges:
detecting pathogenic non-coding variants, and resolving the pathogenicity of ultra-rare missense variants. Here
I propose to address this challenge through the application of genome sequencing (Aim 1), transcriptome
sequencing (Aim 2), and proteomic (Aim 3) methods to evaluate the strengths and weakness of each method
and to improve the diagnostic yield from a cohort of approximately 200 individuals with unsolved Mendelian
myopathies. I hypothesize that since the genetic architecture of Mendelian myopathies implicates large genes
that genome sequencing combined with RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) and proteomics can mitigate the current
low diagnostic yield after clinical evaluation of Mendelian myopathies. Through these approaches, I will define
best practices in applying technologies in the diagnostic evaluation, discover novel disease variants and genes,
and expand our understanding of the genetic architecture of these heterogeneous disorders.
Gaining the analytical skills to evaluate the real-world application of multiomic methods will complement both my
prior expertise in gene discovery for neurologic disorders and my clinical training in neuromuscular medicine. I
am uniquely positioned within the collaborative environment between Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Boston
Children’s Hospital, Broad Institute, and Harvard Medical School to facilitate my transition to an independent
physician-scientist with a long-term translational research goal of developing a center of excellence in the clinical
characterization, molecular diagnosis, and evaluation of targeted gene therapy candidates for patients with
Mendelian myopathies.

This NIH K08 Career Development Award proposal describes a five-year training program studying the role of
NLRP3 inflammasome in Tet2-/- clonal hematopoiesis. The widespread presence of blood cells harboring
somatic genetic alterations in the absence of any hematologic malignancy defines the condition known as
clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP). Both human and mouse studies have demonstrated
significant associations between CHIP and cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
chronic liver disease, osteoporosis, and gout. Focused studies on the genes most frequently mutated in CHIP,
epigenetic regulators TET2 and DNMT3A, have implicated increased chemokine expression and
inflammasome hyperactivation in myeloid cells as a possible mechanistic connection between CH and these
diseases. Dysregulated innate immune and inflammatory signaling also contribute to preleukemic states and
pathogenesis of myeloid disease, but precise mechanisms remain unclear. I propose in Aim 1 to study the role
of NLRP3 inflammasome, a key regulator of inflammation and innate immunity, in mediating Tet2-/- clonal
hematopoiesis. I will characterize the functional role of NLRP3 using an orthogonal approach of clonal
hematopoiesis mouse models, human xenografts and patient specimens. In Aim 2, I propose to characterize
the function of NLRP3 inflammasome at the transcriptional and chromatin levels using single cell sequencing
technology. I will further define the hematopoietic progenitor compartment responsible for Tet2-deficient,
NLRP3-dependent clonal expansion. This work will implicate NLRP3 inflammasome activity in the development
of clonal hematopoiesis and suggest new strategies to target the inflammatory drive in CHIP. The applicant,
Dr. Waihay Wong, has completed clinical training in Anatomic Pathology and Hematopathology at Brigham and
Women’s Hospital (BWH) and Harvard Medical School (HMS). He will complete a research program focused
on training as an independent investigator to study the role of NLRP3 inflammasome in mediating Tet2-/- clonal
hematopoiesis. Dr. Wong proposes to develop expertise in next-generation sequencing, computational
analysis, and mouse models of disease. The mentor, Dr. Benjamin Ebert (HHMI Investigator, Professor of
Medicine at HMS and Chair of Medical Oncology at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, DFCI), is a renowned expert
in the biology of hematopoietic cells and clonal hematopoiesis. Dr. Ebert has successfully mentored numerous
physician-scientists to become independent academic investigators. This mentoring will be supported by
formal course work, seminars, presentations at international meetings, and regular meetings with Dr. Wong’s
Advisory Committee which has complementary expertise and experience in mentoring physician-scientists to
develop independent research programs. Dr. Wong will conduct this research at the DFCI and leverage the
exceptional research and teaching environment at the DFCI, Harvard, and the Broad Institute to complete this
work and realize his long-term career goal of becoming an independent physician-scientist.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Skull base and face imaging accounts for nearly 20% of clinical neuroradiology examinations. But clinical MRI
of the skull base and face continues to rely primarily on conventional 2D T1-weighted and T2-weighted pulse
sequences and fat suppression techniques. These techniques generate suboptimal tissue contrasts with
suboptimal spatial resolution. The long acquisition times often lead to motion artifact. Contrast weightings and
rapid acquisitions tailored to the uniquely small structures of the skull base and face would expand the clinical
utility of MRI for diagnosing pathologies of these regions. Dr. Guenette’s goal for this four-year K08 mentored
career development award is to gain the skills needed to develop comprehensive skull base- and face-specific
MRI sequences and protocols that optimize clinically relevant contrast-to-noise and simultaneously acquire
relaxometry biomarkers that are co-registered to the anatomic images at the voxel level with markedly reduced
scan times compared with current standard-of-care skull base and face MR imaging. Dr. Guenette is a
neuroradiologist with skull base and face sub-specialization at Brigham and Women’s Hospital. His research
has included optimizing product pulse sequences for imaging skull base and face structures. The training
objectives and research activities of this proposal will provide Dr. Guenette with the mentorship, time, and
resources to learn and apply MRI physics, pulse sequence design, and image processing. The main research
expertise of Dr. Guenette’s mentor, Dr. Bruno Madore, an MRI physicist, lies in the development of novel
acquisition and image reconstruction strategies for MRI. The co-mentor, Dr. Ravi Uppaluri, is an
otolaryngology-head/neck surgeon physician-scientist with complementary clinical expertise. In Aim 1 Dr.
Guenette will: build a normative atlas of quantitative T2, T1, and relative proton density values of anatomic
structures in the skull base and face; use this atlas to generate and test theoretically optimal contrasts for
nerve imaging; establish normative T2, T1, and relative proton density values of head and neck squamous cell
carcinoma (HNSCC) tumors to generate and test optimal contrasts for visualizing and segmenting HNSCC
tumors; and test the biomarker potential of T2, T1, and relative proton density measures in HNSCC. In Aim 2
he will: develop a novel pulse sequence that incorporates scanner gradient strength as a parameter to further
decrease scan times and evaluate synthetic pulse sequences across 1.5T, 3T, and 7T field strengths. The
training and data will facilitate Dr. Guenette’s long-term goal to independently lead an NIH-funded laboratory
focused on developing and implementing more rapid qualitative MR anatomic imaging and quantitative MR
methods specifically tailored to the skull base, face, and neck structures and pathologies.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Summary: While ABO(H) blood group antigens were the first human polymorphisms described and
corresponding anti-ABO(H) antibodies continue to be the most common immunological barrier to transfusion and
transplantation, the factors responsible for anti-ABO(H) antibody development remain relatively unknown. In
order to overcome barriers that result from anti-ABO(H) antibody formation, key processes that drive anti-ABO(H)
antibody development need to be defined. Our long-term goal is to define the factors that regulate naturally
occurring anti-ABO(H) antibody formation. Our central hypothesis is that exposure to microbes that decorate
themselves with ABO(H) blood group-like antigens drives innate-like B1 B cells to produce naturally occurring
anti-ABO(H) antibodies. Our hypothesis is formulated on the basis of our recent discovery that microbes that
decorate themselves with carbohydrate structures that mimic blood group antigens stimulate the formation of
anti-blood group antibodies capable of causing hemolytic transfusion reactions (HTRs). Our data demonstrate
that anti-ABO(H) antibodies isolated from patients display unique specificity for distinct types of ABO(H) antigens
and when examined against microbial glycans isolated and presented on a microbial glycan microarray, engage
unique microbial determinants, strongly suggesting that microbial glycans may shape an individual's anti-ABO(H)
antibody response. However, as ABO(H) blood group antigens are carbohydrate structures largely confined to
humans, preclinical models capable of formally testing this have not been available. To overcome this limitation,
we developed a preclinical model that recapitulates key features of naturally occurring anti-blood group antibody
formation. Knocking out the enzyme required for the synthesis of the murine blood group B-like antigen (murine
B or Bm), we generated blood group O-like (murine O or Om) mice that spontaneously develop varying levels of
anti-Bm antibodies capable of causing Bm RBC HTRs following transfusion. Sorting and culturing anti-Bm reactive
microbiota identified a strain of Klebsiella pneumonia that specifically expresses the Bm antigen, providing a
possible link between the microbiota and anti-Bm antibody development. As blood group Om mice and O
individuals possess innate-like B1 B cells with blood group specificity, these collective data suggest that microbial
stimulation of B1 B cells drives the formation of anti-blood group antibodies capable of causing HTRs. To test
this hypothesis, we will pursue the following specific aims: Aim 1. Define the role of B1 B cells and anti-blood
group antibody reactive microbiota in the development of anti-ABO(H) antibodies capable of causing
HTRs. Aim 2. Define the requirement for B1 B cells in microbiota-induced anti-Bm antibody formation
using a preclinical model. These aims will not only define the impact of the microbiota on the development of
anti-blood group antibodies, but provide a rich training opportunity for me to weld my previous training in
transfusion immunology with new training in glycobiology to define the governing factors that regulate the
development of the most common immunological barrier in not only transfusion, but also transplantation.

Fibroblasts are key aggressors in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) where they mediate cartilage and bone destruction,
yet treatments that directly target these cells are lacking. Recent studies from our group and others have
shown that the expansion of an inflammatory subset of fibroblasts are critical to perpetuating the chronic
inflammation in RA, but mechanisms responsible for their inflammatory potentiation are not well-defined. Our
preliminary studies have revealed that synovial fibroblasts are uniquely poised to signal through the Wnt
pathway and further demonstrate that Wnt induces a strong inflammatory response in these cells. Notably,
there is a striking transcriptional gradient demarcated by a Wnt enhancer, R-spondin 3 (RSPO3), and a
putative Wnt inhibitor, Dickkopf-related protein 3 (DKK3), that correlates with Wnt pathway enrichment. We find
that synovial fibroblasts derived from active RA patients show enrichment of gene signatures associated with
Wnt activation and Rspo3 expression, suggesting relevance to arthritis manifestation. We hypothesize that Wnt
signaling through this gradient is critical for mediating inflammatory fibroblast pathogenicity and that Wnt
inhibition can ameliorate joint damage in RA. We develop our hypothesis in three independent aims. In Aim 1,
we define the role of Rspo3 and Dkk3 in regulating Wnt-induced synovial fibroblast activation in vitro using
ligand stimulation and knockdown techniques. In Aim 2, we assess Rspo3 and Dkk3 regulation of Wnt
signaling in synovial fibroblasts of distinct RA patient clinical and histologic phenotypes. Finally, in Aim 3, we
evaluate the clinical utility of targeting stromal Wnt signaling therapeutically in mouse models of inflammatory
arthritis. We anticipate that the significance of these studies will be to elucidate a molecular mechanism
contributing to fibroblast pathogenicity in RA and to address the unmet need for fibroblast-specific therapeutics.
These studies will provide training in immunology, bioinformatics, and murine models of inflammatory arthritis
that that will build a foundation for the PI to develop an independent lab studying the role of stromal cells in
autoimmune disease.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Project Summary
 Over 200 million people are infected with malaria every year. An effective and long-lasting vaccine will
be essential for the elimination and eradication of malaria in Sub-Sharan Africa and worldwide. Though WHO-
approved circumsporozoite protein (CSP) protein vaccine RTS,S is the only vaccine in current use, it provides
<50% protection that is also short lived. The proposed research will delve into the humoral immunity of the
whole sporozoite vaccine (PfSPZ), a model system to identify protective immune responses beyond the
immunodominant epitope CSP - essential insights needed to create new, highly effective malaria vaccines.
 This proposal describes a five-year career development plan to study humoral immunity to the malaria-
causing pathogen Plasmodium falciparum. Though antibodies are important for PfSPZ-mediated protection,
the protective antibody targets and functions remains unknown. Further, PfSPZ's efficacy drops in malaria-
exposed individuals and how pre-existing anti-malarial antibodies affect PfSPZ vaccination remains
unanswered. Our preliminary systems serology analysis of malaria naïve PfSPZ vaccinees has suggested a
new protective role for IgM antibodies to SSP2/TRAP, a malaria host cell recognition and invasion protein, and
validated our approach. The studies proposed here are to 1) define the functional antibody correlates of
protection in malaria-exposed individuals and the effect of pre-existing immunity 2) identify new correlates of
protection with a whole-proteome approach, and 3) define mechanisms of anti-sporozoite immunity of
SSP2/TRAP IgM antibodies. These aims will be carried out with human serum from PfSPZ vaccination and
controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) challenge trials in malaria-naïve and exposed individuals.
 The candidate is currently an Associate Physician at Brigham and Women's Hospital, Instructor in
Medicine at Harvard Medical School (HMS), and Research Fellow at the Ragon Institute with an ongoing
commitment of 80% time to research. The proposal is supported by an expert mentor in humoral immunology,
HMS Professor Facundo Batista, and co-Mentored by expert in systems biology MIT Professor Douglas
Lauffenburger. The candidate is supported by a SAC containing an expert in phage display serological assays,
HMS Professor Stephen Elledge, an expert in malaria vaccinology, NIAID Chief of Cellular Immunology Dr. Robert
Seder, and expert in malaria host-pathogen interactions and pre-erythrocytic immunity University of Washington
Associate Professor Noah Sather. Building on the candidate's doctoral training in malaria pathogenesis and
genomics, this proposal will further his training in humoral immunology, systems biology, and bioinformatics as well
as research scientist-focused professional development and responsible conduct of research coursework.
Completion of this comprehensive training plan will enable the candidate to create a successful and unique research

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Autism spectrum and related neurodevelopmental disorders are thought to arise from widespread mild synaptic
dysfunction that leads to an altered trajectory of brain network development (Johnson et al., 2015). In Rett
syndrome (RTT), a debilitating neurodevelopmental disorder, loss-of-function mutations in MECP2 on the X
chromosome lead to a devastating loss of language, motor and visual function at the behavioral level. Yet no
therapy exists to stop or reverse the cognitive decline. Previous work in RTT mouse models reveal synaptic- and
network-level defects that precede symptom onset. Mecp2-deficiency alters the timing of excitatory synaptic
maturation in excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the developing cortex (Mierau et al, 2016). Microelectrode
array (MEA) recordings and calcium imaging of neuronal activity in cultured murine cortical neurons reveal delays
in the development of functional connectivity in the Mecp2-deficient cortical networks including smaller network
size, weaker strength of connectivity and impairments in the development of network topology including features
that predict local and global efficiency of the networks (Dunn et al, unpublished). These findings reveal cellular-
scale deficits in information processing that likely underlie the cognitive impairment in RTT and could be targeted
with novel therapies to rescue cognitive function. In my proposed K02 and subsequent R01 research, we will
translate this approach to a human in vitro cellular model of RTT. In Aim 1, air-liquid interface cortical organoids
(ALI-COs) will be generated from RTT patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and allogenic
controls to first identify network-level defects in the development of cortical networks. The ALI-CO model shows
further cortical maturation than previous organoid models and avoids the necrotic core (Giandomenico et al.,
2019). In Aim 2, we will target excitatory synaptic maturation in a specific type of inhibitory neuron in the MeCP2-
deficient ALI-COs using novel cell-type specific modulators we identified (Mierau et al, unpublished). Our goal
is to prevent early synaptic defects and ensure the formation of network activity and topology necessary to
support cellular-scale information processing. This strategy could be used in our future R01 research to prevent
the cognitive decline in RTT. In Aim 3, we will develop novel tools for detecting and modulating network dynamics
in the MeCP2-deficient ALI-COs as a platform for testing strategies to rescue network function in RTT after the
cognitive decline has occurred. Re-expressing Mecp2 in adult Mecp2-deficient mice rescues many behavioral
and synaptic features, raising the hope that neuronal function can be rescued in RTT even after the cognitive
decline. We will next test dynamic electric, optogenetic, and pharmacologic approaches for modulating cognitive
function. This will support the subsequent R01 aims in Year 4 and 5 of the K02 award to test whether modulating
network function in real-time can rescue network function in RTT ALI-COs. This strategy would facilitate
screening of novel therapies to unlock function in symptomatic RTT patients and could be applied in the future
to develop new therapies for autism spectrum and other cognitive disorders.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
While opioid drugs are very effective for controlling pain, they are highly addictive. The current clinical decision
making for post-surgical opioid prescribing is still based on oversimplified information. Both opioid use disorder
and opioid-related pain response have strong genetic underpinnings. A better system is needed to guide the
clinical use of genotype data and facilitate better-informed opioid prescribing decision-making.
Electronic health record (EHR) offer a largely untapped source of information to conduct clinically oriented
studies. By integrating genomic data and EHR dataset in large-scale clinical Biobank, we can now perform
"clinical-driven genomic research". This approach is particularly robust for complex diseases with a genetic
susceptibility.
I propose to develop a model to recommend optimal opioid dosage (oral morphine milligram equivalents) for
post-surgical pain relief and predict the risk of post-discharge harmful outcomes. The large-scale clinical and
genomic databases from the Mass General Brigham (MGB) healthcare system, including eight hospitals that
share a centralized database, will be utilized for model development. The proposed research will not only have
strong immediate potential to improve clinical practice in this urgent area but will also provide strong
preliminary work to support my first NIH R01 application.
From the previous projects, I have developed opioid use disorder clinical phenotypes and identified associated
genetic markers. I have also developed machine learning models to predict risks of complex diseases and
explored clinical application potentials. The proposed project will combine my existing analytical skills with the
newer expertise that I seek to develop through this award program, including a nuanced understanding of
analgesic strategies, addiction, and implementation of clinical decision support systems, as well as artificial
intelligence applications in healthcare system.
I have invited several established investigators to form a strong, multi-disciplinary mentorship team. They
include experts in the fields of addiction, pain management, genetic analysis, implementation methods and
artificial intelligence techniques. With their support, I intend to dedicate my longer-term research career to
study functional genomics in the fields of opioid addiction and pain by using integrated analysis of harmonized
big data. The K01 program outlined in this application will provide timely and strategic support for my continued
advancement towards those goals.

Lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) is a nuclear histone demethylase. Our work shows that LSD1 expression
progressively increases with tumor grade and stage in clinical oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Our long-
term goal is to evaluate LSD1 mechanism in progressive oral malignancy based on preliminary studies for
therapeutic applications. Recent preliminary studies showed that conditional LSD1 deletion in the tongue
epithelium during dysplasia reduced invasive pathological lesions, downregulated EGFR, YAP-induced signaling
network, and Pd-L1 expression. Next, the topical application of LSD1 inhibitor during dysplasia prevented its
progression to invasive phenotype, attenuated pathological lesions, expression of Hippo signaling effectors (Yap,
Taz, Ccn2,) and immune checkpoints (Pd-1, and Pd-l1). LSD1 inhibitor sensitized OSCC to combinations with
either YAP inhibitor, anti-PD-1, or anti-PD-L1 antibodies, limiting tumor progression in vivo. Thus, we showed
for the first time that blocking LSD1 inhibits preneoplasia, a feed-forward loop during the progression of
dysplasia to OSCC. Interestingly, LSD1 inhibition attenuates IL-6-JAK-STAT3 novel signaling identified in two
independent studies 1) proteomics analysis of LSD knockout mice preneoplasia and 2) single-cell RNAseq
analysis using LSD1 inhibitor. However, the mechanism of LSD1 function, its target cells in progressive oral
malignancy, and how LSD1 promotes IL-6-JAK-STAT3 remain unclear. This knowledge gap prevents the
targeted design of effective new epigenetic therapeutic strategies for OSCC. We hypothesize that (1) LSD1
upregulation during dysplasia reprograms oral tissue to invasive phenotype by acting on IL6 -signaling and
induced cell types and (2) pharmacological attenuation of LSD1 reset epigenome to reverse progressive
malignant preneoplasia to a noninvasive phenotype. Using clinically relevant animal models, this project is well-
positioned to address the following Specific Aims: 1) to determine how upregulated LSD1 epigenetically
reprogram dysplasia to promote IL6 network during progressive oral preneoplasia invasive phenotype; 2) to
determine if LSD1 collaborates with YAP to promote IL6-JAK-STAT3 network induced invasive phenotype in
preneoplasia, and 3) to determine the translational importance of pharmacological LSD1 inhibition reverse
preneoplasia by inhibiting IL6-JAK-STAT3 signaling induced cancer stem and immune cells. The successful
completion of the proposed project is expected to identify LSD1 and therapeutic application mechanisms in the
IL6-JAK-STAT3 network, related stem cells, and immune cells. Finally, the study will determine if LSD1 a role
in anti-PD-1 immunotherapy resistance and pharmacological LSD1 inhibition can attenuate feline OSCC for a
potential application in veterinary and human medicine. Overall, the study will have a broader impact on future
translational studies in human preneoplasia.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Black Americans are twice as likely as White Americans to have Alzheimer’s disease (AD), independent of
genetic risk. Despite this knowledge, little is known about whether and how chronic experiences of racism
contribute to medial temporal hippocampal (MTH) and prefrontal-executive system integrity, systems that
exhibit profound neurodegeneration in AD and vulnerability to chronic stress. Although comorbid illnesses and
socioeconomic status contribute to the AD health disparity, disparities remain. This highlights a critical unmet
need for understanding social and societal stressors to disparities in brain health. A major contributor to health
inequities in the U.S. is chronic stress due to the cumulative effects of racism over the lifetime. The impact of
chronic interpersonal and institutional/structural racism, unique and salient forms of chronic stress in Black
Americans, on the neurocognitive integrity of these brain systems is not well understood. Since perceived
racism contributes to health disparities in cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors, which are also risk factors
for AD, perceived racism should have a significant impact also on the AD health disparity. The objective of the
parent R01 grant is to investigate the impact of racism on 1) CVD risk and 2) neurocognitive MTH-memory and
prefrontal-executive system integrity in Black seniors and to examine potentially underlying biological
mechanisms. The research objective of this diversity supplement is to examine the impact of consequences of
structural racism on neurocognitive integrity, namely 1) acculturation, a social compensatory mechanism
defined as the incorporation of the cultural norms of the social majority within a society, and 2) lower education
quality, leading to poorer dementia-related health literacy and greater public stigma associated with AD. The
central hypothesis of the parent R01 grant is that cognitively healthy Black seniors who have experienced
higher levels of chronic racism will show greater CVD risk and poorer MTH and prefrontal integrity than those
who have experienced fewer instances of racism over their lifetime. CVD risk and mental health may mediate
(i.e., explain) the relationship between racism burden and neurocognitive integrity. This diversity supplement
extends the parent grant by examining the relationships between AD-related health literacy, and public stigma
associated with AD with cognitive and neuroimaging outcomes (Aim 1) and acculturation (Aim 2) with cognitive
and neuroimaging outcomes. Aim 3 is exploratory and will examine racism burden and public stigma as
moderators of the relationship between acculturation and neurocognitive outcomes. The proposed diversity
supplement is for the candidate to gain expertise in how proxies of anti-Black structural racism affect brain
health in older Black self-identifying adults. To achieve these goals, in addition to the research aims outlined
above, the candidate is proposing training in multimodal neuroimaging (i.e., structural and fMRI) and statistical
modeling, and advancing mastery of MTH- and prefrontal-dependent functions related to anti-Black
racism. This supplement will set up the candidate for success in independent neurocognitive aging research.

 Ethnic disparities represent a significant problem in modern dermatology, and additional efforts are required
to better understand mechanisms underlying the development of skin diseases in patients with skin of color.
 Inflammatory skin conditions (acne, atopic dermatitis, hidradenitis suppurativa) represent a group of
diseases, which disproportionally impact African American (AA) patients including children. Comparative
transcriptome analyses of the skin reveal higher expression of multiple inflammation-related genes in AA healthy
individuals compared to non-Hispanic White (NHW) individuals.
 Regulation of expression of the genes involved in inflammatory skin response occurs at several levels
including signaling/transcription factor-mediated and epigenetic mechanisms. Transposable elements (TEs) are
repetitive mobile segments of DNA that constitute 44%-55% of mouse or human genomes. Inappropriate TE
activation has been implicated in pathogenesis of over 120 human diseases including autoimmune disorders.
 Most TEs are transcriptionally inactive, while their aberrant activation result in a production of double-
stranded (ds) RNA and dsDNA triggering the dsRNA/DNA sensing mechanisms followed by anti-viral immune
response. In the epidermis, UV exposure activates transcription of endogenous retroviral sequences.
Endogenous retroviruses of the HERV-K and W families are significantly upregulated in psoriatic versus non-
lesional skin. However, contribution of TEs to regulation of skin inflammation in AA individuals remain unknown.
 In this Administrative Supplement application to AR078306-03 grant, we will test a hypothesis that aberrant
activation of TEs in epidermal keratinocytes serve as critical determinant driving inflammatory skin response in
individuals with understudied skin types, while pharmacological inhibition of the TE transcription with the
nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors provides a novel strategy for management of inflammatory skin
conditions in these individuals. This hypothesis will be addressed via two Specific Aims:
 1. Perform comparative analyses of the landscapes of transposable element expression in human
epidermal keratinocytes between understudied skin types and NHW skin and correlate these data with
gene expression and patterns of active/repressive covalent DNA/histone modifications.
 2. Define the effects of the inhibitors of dsRNA and dsDNA pathways on expression of inflammation-
associated genes in epidermal keratinocytes isolated from understudied skin types in 3D skin equivalent
culture and in experimental in vitro models of skin inflammation.
 The generated outputs from this application will provide novel insights into fundamental mechanisms
regulating inflammation in understudied human skin types, as well as will promote the development of novel
paradigms for management of skin inflammatory responses in humans via modulation of TE activities.

The ability to regulate when and how emotions are used to guide cognition relies on adaptive and plastic circuits
that can integrate internal limbic-visceral and external sensory-motor information for a given behavioral context.
The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is an area that plays an important role in this process of emotional regulation
and multimodal integration, acting as a unique connectional node for the otherwise segregated cognitive, motor
and limbic networks. The ACC forms a robust network with the amygdala (AMY), a key limbic structure for
emotion and arousal, which exhibits specialized circuit reorganization and plasticity during emotional stress. Our
previously funded R01 (MH116008) focused on comparing the ACC with the lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC),
another region implicated in cognition and stress, and on the extrinsic ACC pathways to cognitive/motor and
limbic areas. It remains unclear how exactly these multimodal pathways interact across the functionally distinct
rostral ‘cognitive’ (a32), ventral ‘limbic’ (a25) and dorsal ‘motor’ (a24) subdivisions of the ACC, which is the focus
of this renewal application. Our work in the previous grant period has shown that the robust ACC interconnections
with AMY span all ACC areas and are therefore, well-suited for integrating information across these distinct ACC
functional domains. Further, compared to ACC projections to cognitive/motor areas in LPFC and dorsal premotor
(PMd) cortices, AMY-targeting ACC pyramidal neurons show greater laminar diversity in their distribution, and
biophysical, structural, and inhibitory synaptic properties. Computational modeling show that these unique single-
cell biophysical and connectional properties contribute to diverse laminar oscillatory dynamics in ACC outputs to
AMY, which can support synchrony at low frequencies in L5, but at high frequencies in L3. In contrast, cortico-
cortical ACC outputs to PMd are more tuned towards higher oscillatory frequencies in both layers. While we have
shown how these extrinsic ACC outputs are diverse at the single cell level, the question remains as to how
multimodal information is integrated within the ACC. This renewal focuses on the largely uncharacterized short-
range interconnections within and between the functionally distinct ACC areas that are likely important for this
multimodal integration. Using anatomical tract-tracing, optogenetics, slice physiology, high-resolution
microscopy and computational modeling we propose to assess intrinsic ACC-ACC interconnections in adult
rhesus monkeys (5-13Y) with regards to their: excitatory vs inhibitory constituents, neuromodulation of synaptic
plasticity, interactions with long-range cognitive (LPFC), motor (PMd) and limbic (AMY) pathways, and
contributions to diverse network dynamics. The overall hypothesis is that distinct short-range intrinsic ACC
circuits have specialized excitatory, inhibitory and neuromodulatory properties and interactions with
long-range cortico-limbic pathways, which endow diverse network oscillatory dynamics and plasticity
in the ACC. Novel data from this study will yield new insights into how selective circuit neuromodulation within
distinct ACC networks can lead to normal cognitive-affective behavior and its dysfunction in the primate.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Amyloid diseases afflict 10 million patients worldwide. This project is focused on AA amyloidosis, a life-threatening complication of chronic inflammation wherein deposition of serum amyloid A (SAA), and its fragments causes kidney and liver damage and, if untreated, death. There is no cure for AA and the treatment options are very limited. To help design amyloid-specific therapies, we will determine how lipids and GAGs, the major ligands of SAA, influence its misfolding. Our prior research revealed that SAA clears diverse lipids from the sites of injury by sequestering them into nanoparticles that facilitate sPLA2 lipolysis; we established the structural basis for this SAA action. Our goal now is to determine how this lipid-scavenging function is linked to pathologic amyloid deposition. Our hypothesis rooted in extensive pilot studies is that lipoprotein formation by SAA is antagonistic to amyloid formation while GAG binding is agonistic. Our powerful approach integrates an array of biochemical, biophysical and computational methods to test this and other new ideas in 3 complementary Specific Aims. Aim 1 will determine how biochemical composition of SAA-lipid complexes influences amyloid formation. Murine or human recombinant SAA will be reconstituted with diverse lipids in complexes that will be selectively hydrolyzed, and amyloid formation will be explored by spectroscopic, electron microscopic, immunochemical and other tools. The results will help identify key steps in SAA-lipid homeostasis that critically influence amyloid formation, and will test a fascinating idea: lipid-modifying strategies may help treat AA amyloidosis. Aim 2 will dissect the amyloidogenic pathways of lipid-bound and free SAA and how GAGs affect these pathways. We will explore the interplay between SAA binding to lipids and GAGs, lipolysis, and formation of amyloid oligomers and fibrils. The results will help target SAA-GAG interactions in AA and other amyloid diseases. Aim 3 will utilize our new versatile ELISA-based assay that uses micrograms of protein to quantify the binding to amyloid modulators during fibrillogenesis. SAA binding to various GAG mimetics and small-molecule drugs will be used as a model; key results will be validated by other methods. Our pilot studies explain the failure of prior clinical trials for AA and suggest that larger molecules can block the SAA-GAG binding. Moreover, we will use our new assay to determine how other amyloid proteins (A, -synuclein, tau, TTR, etc.) interact with diverse amyloid modulators (GAGs, apoE, etc.) Impact: this project will advance AA research and therapeutic targeting to a new level. Moreover, it will develop new tools and concepts that can be extrapolated to other systemic and neurodegenerative amyloid diseases, such as Alzheimer’s and other major diseases.

The Summer Program in Neuroscience (SPIN) at Boston University School of Medicine is a unique, annual 8-
week program in which 10–15 undergraduate students perform mentored neuroscience research, receive
instruction in graduate-/medical-level neuroscience, and observe clinical activities focused on the diagnosis and
treatment of brain disorders. In the classroom, students meet with decorated medical school teaching faculty
and learn basic and clinical neuroscience through small-group interactive sessions, analysis of clinical and
research problems and cases, analysis of brain structure using microscopic brain sections and magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) brain scans, as well as hands-on exploration and dissection of human brains. For the
research portion of the program, students are paired with a faculty member from a basic science or clinical
department and conduct a mentored research project, the results of which are presented at a public conference
that closes the session. In the clinic, students rotate on neurology and neurosurgery inpatient and outpatient
services, attend brain cuttings sessions in the hospital morgue, and review radiographic studies with working
neuroradiologists. These three aspects of the program intersect to generate a nuanced education in the structure
and function of the brain in health and disease from both research and clinical perspectives. To help participants
integrate SPIN experiences with their future, sessions are held that focus on scientific skills and career
development, including sessions on applying to graduate and medical schools, developing oral presentation
skills, and interview skills. End-of-program interviews with prior participants indicate students felt that SPIN was
a life-changing experience that encouraged and helped them pursue further graduate and medical education.
Although we have made every attempt to recruit students from traditionally underrepresented minority
backgrounds, the tuition-based model of our program has been a significant barrier. As a result, SPIN participants
have lacked the diversity that characterize the ideal clinical and research teams. Funding from this proposal
would subsidize the cost of participating in the program (tuition and housing) and provide stipend support for six
scholarships. We will target recruitment to outstanding underrepresented minority students in institutions and
biomedical conferences historically attended by these students, and restructure our application and our
admittance for tuition-based students to place an emphasis on accepting students who have demonstrated
commitment to diversity. We also propose to change the program to target specific scientific skills and expand
programming of career development. Finally, we will implement a thorough real-time tracking and evaluation
plan to follow our students and measure the impact of the program on their career choices through the
establishment of digitally-based interactions and communities. The goal of this proposal is to provide talented
students from underrepresented populations with access to formative experiences and training that will guide
them toward successful biomedical careers and thus diversify the biomedical workforce.

There is growing evidence demonstrating that extreme heat is adversely impacting the mental health of
exposed populations. However, there is a need for further research at high spatial and temporal scales that
allows for investigation of the role of potential neighborhood-level mediators (e.g., residential greenness or air
pollution) and the impacts in potentially vulnerable subgroups. In this mixed-methods study we will investigate
the impact of extreme heat on mental health among uninsured and publicly insured individuals in the City of
Boston, with a particular focus on understanding how both environmental factors and individual behavioral
patterns influence the effects of heat on mental health within this high-risk population. We will first leverage
data (2005 – 2019) from a unique emergency services program (Boston Emergency Services Team [BEST])
that services ~18,000 publicly insured and uninsured persons each year in the greater Boston area. In Aim 1,
we will assess the relationship between temperature and psychiatric emergency services encounters in the
BEST data, with particular focus to diurnal variation in exposure-response that can be leveraged to provide
additional care for these high-risk patients. In Aim 2, we will supplement this quantitative data with the
collection of semi-structured qualitative interviews with clinicians who are treating BEST patients during warm
periods (May 2024 – September 2024). The objective of these interviews is to assess BEST clinician
perspectives on the role that extreme heat plays in mental illness, as well as the feasibility of proposed
interventions within the BEST population. We will also identify key resources needed by clinicians to support
patients who may not have access to traditional protective measures (such as in-home air conditioning) in
managing their mental health during periods of extreme heat. This focus on clinical perspectives is a critical
innovation of this project, as work on climate change and health is often purely epidemiological in nature and
thus misses opportunities for effective intervention to support the health of climate-affected populations.
Finally, in Aim 3, we will quantify the potential for heterogeneity in the temperature-mental health relationship
using the BEST data. We will focus specifically on important individual indicators of vulnerability (including age,
sex, race/ethnicity, and experiencing homelessness), as well as neighborhood-level features such as air
pollution, the built environment / urban greenspace, and the presence of existing interventions (e.g., cooling
centers) intending to reduce the health impacts of extreme heat in the greater Boston area. The findings from
Aim 3 will complement the qualitative data produced in Aim 2 to provide a fuller understanding of the factors
that contribute to mental health impacts of extreme heat, ranging from social and behavioral to environmental
determinants. Overall, this study will provide crucial information to support this high-risk population in the
context of extreme heat and global climate change.

Millions of Americans are exposed daily to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) due to the current and
historical use of these chemicals in consumer and industrial products. PFAS exposure in humans is associated
with liver disease and serum hyperlipidemia (increased serum cholesterol, in particular). However, understanding
the mechanism(s) linking PFAS exposure to dyslipidemia is hindered by 1) the ability of PFAS to activate
peroxisome proliferator activated receptor α (PPARα), a receptor activated by fibrate drugs that reduces serum
triacylglycerides, 2) apparently disparate effects of PFAS on serum lipids in human and rodents (in which PFAS
can decrease serum lipids), 3) lack of understanding if/how PFAS congeners exert distinct effects on lipid
homeostasis, and 4) species differences in nuclear receptors that regulate PFAS-induced effects. Our
overarching objective is to determine the mechanisms by which PFAS disrupt systemic lipid homeostasis. Our
research focuses on nuclear receptors that are activated by PFAS and are directly involved in lipid regulation:
PPARα, constitutive androstane receptor (CAR), and pregnane X receptor (PXR). PPARα activation decreases
hepatic and serum lipids while CAR and PXR activation can have the opposite effect. There are two major
chemical classes of PFAS: perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCA) and perfluoroalkyl sulfonic acids (PFSA). We
used a human-relevant model in vitro to show that PFCA and PFSA activate human PPARα (huPPARα) with
differing efficacies. Using mice expressing huPPARα and fed an American diet, we showed that: 1)
perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) activates hepatic huPPARα in vivo at body burdens found in humans, 2) CAR
and PXR also are strongly activated, 3) PFOA increases liver lipids and serum cholesterol, and 4) PFOA’s effects
are sex-dependent. Given the strength of the PFAS-induced CAR/PXR signal, the potential for CAR/PXR to
differentiate the effects of PFCAs and PFSAs, and that CAR/PXR also are activated in a species-specific manner,
we propose that the most human relevant in vivo model should be multi-humanized. Thus, our Specific Aims are
as follows. In Aim 1, we will refine our novel mouse model to investigate human relevant mechanisms of PFAS
action by incorporating human CAR (huCAR) and PXR (huPXR) into the huPPARα mouse and update our novel
“What we eat in America” diet. In Aim 2, we will test the contribution of huPPARα to PFAS-induced toxicological
effects in vivo in the context of huCAR and huPXR by comparing effects in huPPARα+:huCAR+:huPXR+ and
PPARαNull(mouse/human):huCAR+:huPXR+ mice exposed to human-relevant PFAS levels. We will test the hypotheses
that a) activation of PPARα by PFAS limits their capacity to stimulate hepatic steatosis and serum hyperlipidemia
by counteracting effects of CAR/PXR activation and b) PFAS structure will determine the balance of
huPPARα:huCAR/huPXR activation resulting in differences in toxicological effects. Results will fill critical gaps
by generating an in vivo, human-relevant model to investigate PFAS-induced, clinically-relevant disease and
providing novel insights into the mechanisms of action of PFAS in liver and intestine.

A major unmet goal in pulmonary medicine is to distinguish pneumonia sub-phenotypes responsive to host-
directed therapies. We observe that some humans who died with pneumonia have abundant fibrin in their
airspaces while others show little or none, correlating with neutrophils and necrosis. Similarly, some mouse
models of pneumonia result in lungs with abundant airspace fibrin, while others do not; airspace fibrin
associates with both neutrophils and necrosis in these models as well. While fibrin in the airspaces is a
recognized pathological feature of pneumonia, this heterogeneity is not. Because fibrin can be pro-
inflammatory and neutrophils can enhance fibrin accumulation, we propose the central hypothesis that fibrin
and neutrophils in the airspaces form a positive feedback loop that causes damage in a subset of pneumonias.
We will test this by pursuing three independent but mutually informative specific aims. In Aim 1, we will
determine whether fibrin in the airspaces drives neutrophilic pulmonary inflammation and adverse outcomes,
during high-fibrin pneumonia. Using genetic and pharmacologic approaches to interrupt key endogenous
drivers or inhibitors of fibrin accumulation (tissue factor, thrombin, or plasmin), we will test whether loss or gain
of fibrin decreases or increases, respectively, neutrophils and adverse outcomes like necrosis and lung injury
during the high-fibrin but not low-fibrin type of pneumonia in mice. In Aim 2, we will determine whether
neutrophils amplify fibrin accumulation in the airspaces, during high-fibrin pneumonia. We will use gene-
targeted mice to test whether CD11b and neutrophil elastase are each essential for airspace fibrin
accumulation during the high-fibrin but not low-fibrin sub-phenotype of pneumonia. We will also test whether
pharmacologically reducing fibrin or elastase activity when pneumonia is already underway can sever the
proposed positive feedback loop and improve outcomes during the high-fibrin pneumonia in mice. In Aim 3, we
will determine whether high-fibrin pneumonias involve distinctive lung transcriptomes that include a pro-fibrin
signature in airspace cells. We will profile lung transcriptomes of humans who died with high-fibrin vs. low-fibrin
pneumonia, to identify differentially expressed genes and pathways. In mouse models, we will compare lung
transcriptomes over the time-course of lethal high- and low-fibrin pneumonias, to reveal dynamics of changes
as well as consistencies or differences between the human subjects and mouse models. From mouse lungs,
airspace cells (alveolar macrophages, epithelial cells, and neutrophils) will be sorted from high- and low-fibrin
pneumonias to identify cell-specific transcriptome differences between these pneumonia sub-phenotypes. The
proposed studies will help elucidate the mechanisms and significance of high fibrin accumulation in the
airspaces of infected lungs. Results will be informative for whether and which subsets of pneumonia patients
may respond favorably to host-directed therapies targeting fibrin (like anticoagulants and fibrinolytics) and/or
neutrophils (like CD11b blockade or elastase inhibitors).

In high income countries, SUDI, and its sub-categories (1) Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) and (2)
Accidental Suffocation Deaths (ASD), are the leading preventable causes of infant mortality. The ensuing ‘back
to sleep’ campaigns have since proven among the most effective public health strategies ever identified for
reducing infant mortality. Yet, in low and middle-income countries (LMICs) almost nothing is known about the
burden of SUDI or its modifiable risk factors, and very few African countries have policies targeting SUDI. In our
recent systematic review, we documented a near absence of research on SUDI in Africa, excepting several well-
conducted investigations from South Africa. Our focus on SUDI emerged during a multi-year postmortem infant
surveillance project to establish the fatal burden of Respiratory Syncytial Virus. Over 3 years, we enrolled ~80%
of all infant deaths in Lusaka, Zambia, nearly 2,300 infants. Ultimately, SUDI was implicated in 7.4% of those
community deaths. Far from being rare, SUDI appeared to be a very common cause of infant demise, with
modifiable risk factors that were ubiquitous yet wholly unaddressed by existing policies in Zambia. If confirmed,
SUDI constitutes a major unmet opportunity to reduce infant mortality in Africa that has largely been ignored by
the global health community. Yet, our early data fall short of the gold standard for evaluating SUDI deaths.
Robust local prevalence data will be essential to support policy initiatives targeting SUDI and as a baseline from
which to judge the impact of such policies. Therefore, we are proposing Project Chisoni, a rigorous 5-year study
to precisely define the burden of SUDI and its modifiable risk factors in Zambia.
To achieve those broader goals, we have convened a multinational multidisciplinary team with expertise in
pediatrics, cause of death analysis, SUDI, pathology, molecular biology, and SUDI epidemiology. Our aims are:
SA1 will create a ‘gold standard’ evaluation of community infant deaths to demonstrate the burden of SUDI in
an African setting, which will include in-depth post-mortem evaluations, multiplex PCR to identify unanticipated
infectious causes of death and detailed death scene investigations to understand the context in which each death
occurred. This will generate the proportion of deaths that are due to SUDI and SUDI deaths/1000 live births.
SA2 includes three sub-aims. SA2.1 will be a matched case-control study examining the association of risk
factors with SUDI among the cases in SA1 vs. a group of contemporaneously enrolled healthy control infants;
SA2.2 takes the ORs and prevalence data from SA1 and S2.1 to calculate the population attributable fraction
(PAF) for risk factors alone or in combination, and therefore the theoretical number of lives that could be saved
through mitigation; and SA2.3 seeks to expand the generalizability of this project by conducting additional risk
factor prevalence surveys in different urban and rural settings in Zambia and several other African nations.

Parasitic infections by Trypanosoma brucei spp. undermine public health and economy in Sub-Saharan Africa.
From the basic science vantage point, discoveries of antigenic variation, trans-splicing, and RNA editing in these
early branching protozoans have contributed fundamental tenets of eukaryotic biology. Notably, work on
mitochondrial U-insertion/deletion mRNA editing introduced the guide RNA concept, a foundation of modern
genome altering technologies. Identification of terminal RNA uridylyltransferases (TUTases) in trypanosomes
has led to recognition of uridylation’s broad significance and diverse cellular roles, ranging from microRNA
turnover in flies to maternal mRNA clearance in mammals. Emerging structural insights establish mitochondrial
U-tailing in T. brucei as the paradigm of RNA processing and decay pathways present in most eukaryotes.
Conversely, the internal U-insertion is a central editing reaction unique to Kinetoplastea. This project will reveal
the mechanisms of TUTase-dependent RNA maturation and editing processes at atomic resolution.
Aim 1 investigates how the TUTase—exonuclease—RNA helicase nexus orchestrates mitochondrial RNA
metabolism. It focuses on protein complexes that couple U-tailing by KRET1 (T1) with degradation, and thereby
govern biogenesis, functionality, and metabolic fates of rRNAs, mRNAs and guide RNAs. Molecular, proteomics,
imaging and cryo-EM approaches will define T1 complexes’ functions, composition, interactomes and structures.
We have identified and will characterize an RNA helicase which links gRNA processing and editing.
Aim 2 examines the structural basis of U-insertion mRNA editing. We have discovered KRET2 (T2) and MEAT1
(M1) and their distinct complexes. By determining in vivo substrates and cryo-EM structures of these assemblies,
we will uncover the mechanisms of editing site selection and U-insertion by divergent T2 and M1 TUTases.

Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a debilitating condition with deleterious effects on individuals and
society. Evidence-based treatments for PTSD are available, including cognitive processing therapy (CPT) and
prolonged exposure (PE), but response rates are suboptimal, and dropout rates are high. Patients report
concerns about treatment that prevent optimal response, but evidence suggests therapists are often unaware of
patients' concerns and do not intervene effectively to help their patients benefit from treatment. The purpose of
this research is to refine and test an Adjunctive Writing intervention for Amplifying Response and Engagement
(AWARE), which was developed to enhance outcomes in CPT and PE. AWARE integrates findings from the field
of health communication and uses a writing task and guided therapist responses to facilitate improved patient-
therapist communication about patients’ treatment-related concerns during existing check-ins in CPT and PE.
After iteratively refining AWARE through a case series (n=4), a pilot randomized controlled trial (n=50) will be
conducted to preliminarily compare CPT/PE with AWARE to CPT/PE treatment as usual (TAU). The primary aim
of the RCT is to take an experimental therapeutics approach to demonstrate that AWARE is feasible, acceptable,
and engages the target of improved patient-therapist communication relative to TAU. A preliminary examination
will also be conducted of the effects of 1) AWARE vs. TAU, and 2) variability in patient-therapist communication
on symptom improvement and treatment completion. An exploratory aim is to examine patient-therapist
communication as a mechanism of improved symptom reduction and attendance in AWARE using session-by-
session assessments to see if the putative mechanism precedes and predicts the outcomes. This trial is
consistent with NIMH's Strategy 3.1.A, "Developing novel interventions using a mechanism-informed,
experimental therapeutics approach," and can both enhance outcomes for patients with PTSD and improve the
field's knowledge of processes for enhancing PTSD treatments. Further, given that AWARE is a brief intervention
that can be implemented during existing check-ins in evidence-based treatments, AWARE can be easily scaled
and implemented to enhance outcomes across mental health disorders. The proposed research and training
plans will allow the applicant to gain essential knowledge and applied experience in 1) refining and evaluating a
mechanism-based intervention to enhance PTSD treatments, 2) translating health communication knowledge to
improve PTSD treatment outcomes, 3) using advanced data analyses to examine mechanisms of therapeutic
change, 4) conducting clinical trials in an experimental therapeutics framework, and 5) professional development
and grantsmanship. It will facilitate the applicant's transition to an independent investigator who uses treatment
mechanistic knowledge to optimize PTSD treatment outcomes. This project will take place at the National Center
for PTSD at VA Boston Healthcare System with support from accomplished mentors committed to the applicant's
professional development: Drs. Tara Galovski (primary mentor), Shannon Kehle-Forbes, and Brian Smith.

The goal of this Program Project Grant (PPG) is advancing the latest discoveries in stem cell biology, human
organoid models, and gene editing to understand and treat genetic lung diseases. After a century of basic
sciences advances, culminating in recent Nobel Prize-winning discoveries, such as nuclear reprogramming
and gene editing, biomedical research now faces an inflection point, poised for clinical translation of basic
science successes. While it is hard to envision a more optimistic time in health-related research, treatments for
many devastating lung diseases have not yet been realized, and clinical therapies in most cases still largely
focus on treating symptoms or maintaining life support to allow endogenous lung tissue stem cells enough time
to repair, without available therapies able to interrupt disease-initiating mechanisms or augment the lung’s
capacity to regenerate. Here we address these challenges by proposing an integrated, multi-investigator PPG
to translate lung stem cell research from basic discovery to future clinical applications. An initial focus on
ameliorating genetic lung diseases of the airway and alveoli is pursued, given that their proximal
disease-driving gene mutations are well described. The use induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) carrying
these mutations or their gene-edited progeny is a shared technology harnessed by all Projects together with a
proposed Gene Editing Core, and coordinated by an Administrative Core. Our 4 project leaders have worked
together extensively to develop protocols to differentiate iPSCs into a broad diversity of lung epithelial lineages,
recently optimizing methods to produce the two stem cell populations that maintain all airway and alveolar
epithelia, basal cells and alveolar type 2 cells (AT2s), respectively. Having established these stem cell banks
and protocols, we turn our focus here on applying these resources to advance our mechanistic understanding
of how gene mutations initiate airway and alveolar epithelial dysfunction resulting in disease, and we seek to
therapeutically intervene with novel precision therapeutics or regenerative cell therapies. Towards these
goals, we here propose 4 projects and 2 cores, all interacting to complete shared aims, and synergistic
cross-project experiments. Aim 1 will promote collaborative, integrated cross-project approaches that
produce new human models of genetic airway and alveolar diseases, and will apply these in vitro iPSC and
organoid-based models to understand basic pathogenic mechanisms that lead from epithelial dysfunction to
lung disease. Aim 2 will identify potential therapeutic strategies able to reverse or ameliorate aberrant
pathways responsible for the alveolar dysfunction present in genetic diseases that affect the distal lung,
including proteostasis, mitochondrial dysfunction, and metabolic changes that we hypothesize lead to
reversible epithelial toxic gain-of-function phenotypes. Aim 3 will develop a future approach for treating genetic
lung diseases based on the in vivo reconstitution of airway and alveolar stem cell compartments via
intra-airway transplantation of pluripotent stem cell-derived airway basal or distal alveolar epithelial cells.

Older Black Americans have higher rates of cognitive impairment and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) than their
White counterparts, a disparity that is greater for Black women. Given the lack of effective therapies to slow
disease progression and symptoms, effective prevention is needed. Most knowledge of risk factors for
cognitive decline, the hallmark feature of AD, comes from studies of White populations and the contribution of
racially/socially-patterned risk factors among Black adults remains under-studied. We propose to study 2,500
Black women ages 55 and older from the Black Women’s Health Study (BWHS), a follow-up study of 59,000
Black women from across the US. Our goal is to identify social factors that, together with biomarkers of AD,
influence cognitive decline. The BWHS provides a unique opportunity to accomplish this goal. Over 27 years,
the BWHS has collected data through biennial questionnaires from participants on socioeconomic,
psychological, and physical stressors occurring at various times of life (e.g., low parental education, childhood
sexual/physical abuse, interpersonal racism), as well as information on many potential risk factors for AD and
cognitive decline (e.g., demographics, body size, behavioral factors (e.g., exercise, diet, smoking), medical
history, reproductive history, medication use, health care). The BWHS has collected and stored blood from a
large subsample of participants who agreed to wide sharing, such as GWAS results with other investigators
and public databases. After enrollment of 2,500 such participants with already-collected blood samples from
the BWHS, we propose to administer a validated telephone cognitive battery annually to measure cognition.
We will also measure a panel of AT(N) plasma biomarkers and conduct GWAS in order to examine the
associations of plasma biomarkers and genetic variants with cognitive decline. Based on the collected data
and the results from biomarker assessments, we will assess the joint effects of the stressors and biomarkers
on cognitive decline. A feasibility study demonstrated the willingness of BWHS participants to complete the
cognitive test battery over the telephone and indicated that enough BWHS participants will participate to reach
a study size of ~2,500 participants. The investigators have the experience and expertise to enroll participants;
measure cognition with a validated telephone cognitive battery; measure AT(N) biomarkers in stored plasma
and conduct GWAS; and with these data, to assess their separate and joint effects on cognitive decline. The
proposed study provides an unparalleled opportunity to leverage a large national sample of older Black women
on which comprehensive data on many factors that affect cognition have been collected to identify life-course
risk factors for cognitive decline. The findings will have important translational implications for efforts to prevent
cognitive decline in all populations, but especially in Black women who are disproportionately burdened.

This K08 Mentored Clinical Scientist Development Award will provide Dr. Kelsey Serier with training to develop
an independent research career devoted to understanding the effect of trauma and trauma-related negative
mental health sequalae, namely posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), on the development and course of type
2 diabetes (T2D). Dr. Serier has assembled an impressive interdisciplinary mentorship team comprised of
experts in trauma, behavioral science, epidemiology, endocrinology, and health informatics to support her
development and successful completion of the proposed training and research goals. Through a
comprehensive and carefully designed training plan, Dr. Serier will address previous training gaps and develop
skills in (1) domain-specific knowledge related to PTSD and T2D, (2) epidemiologic methods and longitudinal
data analysis, and (3) professional development and grant writing. A cross-cutting training goal is furthering her
skills in conducting interdisciplinary team science. The proposed research program leverages the largest
electronic health record cohort of individuals at risk of T2D (n = 6,082,018) in the United States. Data come
from the Veteran’s Health Administration and includes an extensive set of clinician-based diagnoses,
laboratory tests, and up to 15 years of follow-up data. Utilizing this cohort, the current study aims to address
several critical gaps in our current knowledge of PTSD and T2D, specifically: (1) a lack of prospective data that
include clinician-derived diagnostic information, (2) minimal consideration of psychiatric comorbidity, (3) limited
investigation of PTSD on outcomes in individuals with T2D, including glycemic control, and (4) an absence of
studies considering the impact of sex, race, and ethnicity. Aim One will estimate the effect of PTSD,
depression, and their comorbidity on the rate of T2D using cox proportional hazard models and interaction
contrasts. Aim Two will include individuals who developed T2D during the study period (n = 936,596). A series
of conditional logistic regression models and interaction contrasts will be used to estimate the odds of poor
glycemic control in PTSD, depression, and their comorbidity relative to non-psychiatric comparison groups.
Aim Three will examine the extent to which sex, race, and ethnicity modify the associations in Aims One and
Two. The current study includes a large number of women (n = 504,002) and individuals identifying as non-
Hispanic Black (n = 888,465), and Hispanic and Latino (n = 331, 817) to allow for analyses examining the
differential effect of PTSD on T2D in subpopulations with a higher burden of disease. The unique data source
and methodological rigor of the proposed study offers an efficient way to examine the associations between
PTSD and a range of T2D-related outcomes, which will ultimately inform targeted T2D prevention and
intervention approaches. Furthermore, the project will provide the applicant with essential interdisciplinary
training for an independent and integrative research program examining associations between the
psychological sequalae of trauma and T2D.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：SIGNIFICANCE: G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the largest class of membrane proteins in the human
genome and are implicated in a wide array of cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. Notably, GPCRs are the
targets of one third of FDA approved therapeutics, including drugs prescribed for coronary heart disease,
hypertension, and asthma. However, of the ~800 known GPCRs, ~120 are orphan receptors (oGPCRs), which
are considered druggable targets but remain understudied in basic research efforts as they lack a known ligand.
Over the past two decades, extensive efforts to deorphanize oGPCRs have resulted in little turnout. It is evident
there is a need to increase the rate of discovery of ligands for oGPCRs. This proposal outlines a yeast directed
evolution platform for systematic, high-throughput discovery of antibody-based ligands for oGPCRs.
Deorphanizing a single oGPCR alone would open the door to understanding new biology and development of a
potential therapeutic agent.
BACKGROUND: oGPCR deorphanization efforts have been historically slow and low-throughput. Conventional
screens for oGPCR ligands can handle many targets, but due to the sheer amount of possibilities, including
protons, photons, lipids, hormones, peptides, and larger proteins, success has been limited. Nanobodies, or
small antibody fragments, offer distinct advantages for ligand screening, namely their suitability to directed
evolution. Directed evolution allows for billions of nanobodies to be screened for binding and modulation of
oGPCRs with a simple growth selection. Using a yeast-based hypermutation directed evolution platform, and a
precise, scalable, high-throughput continuous culture device, directed evolution campaigns can be scaled up to
ensure a deep search of nanobody sequence space.
SYNOPSIS OF AIMS: In this proposal are two related, but not interdependent aims. AIM1 establishes a
systematic workflow for the functional reconstitution of human GPCRs in yeast, which will (1) create a library of
yeast strains with orphan and non-orphan GPCRs, and (2) elucidate general guidelines to increase success
rates of GPCR expression in yeast. AIM2 takes oGPCRs found to be functional in yeast and uses them to run
directed evolution campaigns to discover nanobody ligands and validate these ligands in human cells. Both aims
can be developed in parallel, with results from AIM1 being progressively integrated into AIM2. Together, these
innovative platforms will lead to the deorphanization of many oGPCRs, thereby enabling the exploration of new
GPCR biology and pharmacology.

The maintenance of cellular and tissue homeostasis relies on the tight regulation of cell growth and proliferation.
This regulation is predominantly controlled by two evolutionarily conserved pathways: the mammalian Target of
Rapamycin (mTOR) pathway and the Hippo pathway. Dysregulation of both the mTOR and Hippo pathways
promotes aberrant cell proliferation, tissue overgrowth and tumor development. Elucidating how the mTOR and
Hippo signaling pathways coordinate their activities is therefore a vitally important, yet poorly understood, area
of cell cancer biology. Our lab previously demonstrated that STK25, a serine/threonine kinase, functions as an
upstream activator of Hippo signaling to limit cell growth. Using unbiased approaches, we have now generated
strong preliminary data suggesting that the STK25 kinase also functions to impair mTORC1 signaling. We have
found that that genetic depletion of STK25 leads to both mTORC1 pathway activation and Hippo pathway
inactivation. These data suggest that STK25 may play a critical role in regulating cell proliferation and tumor
suppression by coordinating the activities of both the mTORC1 and Hippo signaling pathways. However, the
mechanism by which STK25 regulates mTORC1 is unknown. In this proposal, we hypothesize that STK25
directly regulates and phosphorylates key regulatory components of the mTORC1 signaling pathway, ultimately
attenuating mTOR signaling. Further, our preliminary studies of STK25 knockout in mice demonstrate that
conditional depletion of STK25 is sufficient to induce tumorigenesis, which is congruent with bioinformatic
evidence that STK25 is significantly focally deleted in a variety of human cancers. Combining this with our in
vitro findings, we also hypothesize that STK25 deficient tumors are dependent on YAP/TAZ and/or mTORC1
activity for growth and survival. These hypotheses will be tested in two specific aims. In Aim 1, we will use cell
biological and biochemical approaches to mechanistically define the role of STK25 kinase in regulating mTORC1
activity by characterizing its direct phosphorylated substrates. In Aim 2, we will use a conditional STK25 knockout
mouse that we have already generated to determine if STK25 loss facilitates tumorigenesis through increased
YAP/TAZ and/or mTORC1 activity. Successful completion of these aims will advance our understanding of
mTORC1 and Hippo signaling, and reveal significant new insights into the underlying mechanisms driving tumor
development. Moreover, the proposed training plan will greatly enhance my repertoire of skills in microscopy and
imaging techniques, molecular cell biology, mouse cancer studies and liquid chromatography mass spectrometry
(LC-MS/MS) analysis. Altogether, this will facilitate the development of my scientific expertise in the fields of
mTOR and Hippo signaling in cancer biology required for success as an independent scientist.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
The sensory thalamus serves as a hub for incoming information encoding different features of the
outside world. This information is parsed and modified as it is transmitted to the cortex. In the visual
thalamus (the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus), retinal ganglion cell axons converge onto proximal
dendrites of thalamocortical neurons, forming clusters of boutons that stud the dendrites. Many of
these bouton clusters are ensheathed by astrocytes along with synaptic terminals from
neuromodulatory projections and inhibitory dendrodendritic presynaptic terminals. Collectively, this
synaptic motif is called the glomerulus, described beautifully by electron microscopy in many thalamic
nuclei and across many species. While the glomerulus is quite striking, the functional relevance of
this structural motif is still debated.
To address this critical question, here, we propose to establish and characterize mice in which the
glomerular astrocytic sheath is disrupted by genetic deletion of a member of the family of fibroblast
growth factor receptors. Our preliminary data shows that deletion of this receptor from astrocytes
results in reduced astrocytic sheaths around clusters of retinal ganglion cell boutons and aberrant
retinogeniculate functional refinement. We will extend these findings to elucidate the role of this
receptor in the development of astrocytic morphology, glomerular structure and the elimination and
strengthening of retinogeniculate synapses in the visual thalamus. We will also examine whether and
how defects in astrocytic ensheathment of the glomerulus may contribute to aberrant retinogeniculate
synapse refinement. Finally, we will take advantage of the disrupted glomerular ensheathment in
mutant mice to test the hypothesis that the glomerular structure enhances crosstalk between
synapses within the astrocytic sheath that is mediated by glutamate and GABA spillover.
If these proposed experiments are successful, results from these studies will advance our
understanding of how information is organized in the thalamus and the functional sequela of
disruption of this organization.

 Filoviruses are prime examples of zoonotic viruses that cause fulminant hemorrhagic diseases in humans
and nonhuman primates (NHP), resulting in death in up to 90% of human case. The filoviridae family contains
six genera in which several species are known to have high fatality rates, all of which are within
the Marburgvirus or Ebolavirus genera and will therefore be the focus of this proposal. The largest ever 2014
Ebola virus (EBOV) disease outbreak in West Africa underscored the development and regulatory approval of
antiviral countermeasures, including an emergency-use vaccine and therapeutic monoclonal antibodies. While
these countermeasures are highly beneficial to block EBOV infection and interfere with disease progression at
early stages, they are less suitable for the treatment of late-stage EBOV disease (EVD), which is less studied.
Late-stage disease is characterized by gastrointestinal manifestations including diarrhea. At present, no
available animal models, including the classical NHP model, can recapitulate the gastrointestinal symptoms of
EVD patients. To elucidate the role of the intestinal epithelium in disease initiation and progression, we propose
to establish an intestinal filovirus infection model using human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC)-derived
human intestinal organoids (HIOs).
 We hypothesize that infection with EBOV and MARV compromises barrier integrity of the intestinal
epithelium and causes abnormal ion flux as the basis for gastrointestinal dysfunction and diarrhea. This
project proposes the establishment of a polarized 2-dimentional HIO transwell system that will be used to study
the pathophysiological effects of filovirus infection on intestinal epithelial integrity. In Aim 1, we will characterize
filovirus-mediated injury by analyzing (1) intestinal barrier and (2) tight junction integrity. We hypothesize that the
sepsis-like syndrome that occurs in some patients with severe disease may be due to loss of epithelial barrier
integrity in the intestine. In Aim 2, we intend to validate the role of individual genes by genetic ablation and test
potential drug candidates as modulators of intestinal epithelial function. We hypothesize that if tight junctions are
compromised in infected HIOs, then treatment with small molecule inhibitors targeted at ion exchanger would
reverse the leaky junctions by blocking the receptor responsible for the disassemble of the junction. The aims
proposed in this study will result in an improved model which more closely recapitulates in vivo intestinal epithelial
phenotypes, and thus can be used to inform novel therapeutics targeted at late-stage filovirus infection.
 The successful, longstanding mentorship of Drs. Mostoslavsky and Mühlberger, the collaborative support of
the CReM, the availability of the NEIDL research facilities and the rigorous MTM training program will provide
me with the tools and support needed to successfully complete my dissertation work. These departments instill
important values about the rigorous approach to academic science by supporting technical training, writing
workshops and seminar and lecture series.

 Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a life-threatening disorder characterized by elevated lung
pressure, right heart failure, and premature death. Current therapies fail to prevent disease progression due to
their inability to suppress and reverse obliterative lesions resulting from vascular remodeling. Previous studies
have centered on large arteriolar remodeling in vessels with a diameter >100 µm. However, the role of the
capillary bed (vessels <10 µm) in remodeling remains largely ignored. Pericytes (PCs) are indispensable mural
cells for maintaining capillary integrity and homeostasis. Our preliminary data showed that the loss of PCs
induced excessive capillary and arteriolar remodeling and manifested hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension
and right ventricular hypertrophy in transgenic animals. Additionally, human idiopathic PAH (IPAH) PCs showed
high proliferation and motility, and human IPAH induced-pluripotent stem cells (IPAH-iPSC) derived mural cells
lost PCs but gained more smooth muscle characteristics. Vascular organoids derived from IPAH iPSCs further
demonstrated a reduced number of endothelial cell (EC) tubes and increased smooth muscle coverage, which
recapitulated abnormal vasculature development without PCs. Single-cell RNAseq revealed upregulated
expression of the Regulator of G-protein signaling 5 (RGS5) in the IPAH PC cluster, which was validated in IPAH
PCs isolated from explanted lungs, hypoxic mouse PCs, and explanted IPAH lung tissues. Thus, we
hypothesize that RGS5 overexpression mediates PC dysfunction (detachment and migration) and, in
turn, capillary remodeling in IPAH. We proposed to 1) Characterize the impact of PC dysfunction on EC
dysfunction, vascular integrity, and remodeling in PC-depleted transgenic animals; 2) determine how RGS5
signaling regulates PC detachment, proliferation/migration, and EC interaction in clinical IPAH samples; 3)
Characterize the impact of RGS5 depletion on PC/EC cell-cell interactions in IPAH iPSC vascular organoids.
This project will provide novel insight into PC pathobiology in capillary remodeling and establish RGS5 as a
potential therapeutic target in PAH, for which the first drugs to treat this devastating disease may be found.

Hemizygous microdeletions encompassing TBX1 cause 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS), the most
common deletion syndrome in humans. Among a broad spectrum of clinical features that often include
craniofacial dysmorphia, congenital heart defects (CHDs) of the outflow tract (OFT), and aortic arch, which is
derived from embryonic vessels termed pharyngeal arch arteries (PAAs), are the main causes of mortality
during childhood. Importantly, specific craniofacial muscles, the OFT, and PAAs all derive from the pharyngeal
apparatus, a transient series of arches and pouches that form by segmentation on the lateral surface of the
head. Because segmentation is severely compromised in Tbx1-deficient animals, their craniofacial and
cardiovascular defects were considered secondary. Using zebrafish as a model, my laboratory reported that
tbx1 mutant embryos recapitulate several aspects of 22q11.2DS, including craniofacial muscle, OFT, and PAA
deficiencies. We also demonstrated that these end structures descend from nkx2.5+ progenitors initially
specified in the anterior lateral plate mesoderm (ALPM) before becoming sequestered in the cores of the
pharyngeal arches. Unexpectedly, we discovered that tbx1 mutants fail to specify the nkx2.5+ pharyngeal
lineage in the ALPM that gives rise to the missing derivatives. Because this phenotype precedes pharyngeal
segmentation, defects in progenitor specification are likely causal for the deficiencies observed in tbx1
mutants. The aberrant fates of these progenitors, which maintain hand2 and gata5 expression in the ALPM,
are unknown. Moreover, the molecular mechanisms by which Tbx1 directs specification of the pharyngeal
lineage in the ALPM have not been elucidated in any model system. Here, we have the unique opportunity to
uncover the molecular mechanisms by which Tbx1 directs specification of the pharyngeal progenitor cell
lineage because we have defined the relevant developmental time window for analysis, identified markers of
the preserved (gata5+) and missing (nkx2.5+) progenitor populations, implemented single-cell RNA and ATAC
sequencing that allows for unprecedented resolution of changes in cellular populations and chromatin
accessibility, and generated state-of-the-art genetic tools for tracking the aberrant fates of tbx1-expressing
cells in tbx1 mutants and for identifying Tbx1 target loci that confer the pharyngeal progenitor cell fate. Overall,
we propose to use the attributes of the zebrafish system, including its genetic tractability, unmatched
embryonic accessibility, and imaging capabilities, to reveal new mechanistic insights that will provide the most
comprehensive view of how Tbx1 is necessary and potentially sufficient for instructing the pharyngeal
progenitor cell lineage during vertebrate development.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Project Summary/Abstract
 Pancreatic cancer (PC) is one of the most lethal forms of cancer in the United States (5-year survival rate
 below 10%). PC patients are usually diagnosed with a non-resectable disease (80-85%) and have a dismal
 prognosis with a survival period of only 3-6 months after the diagnosis. Nucleoside analogs (e.g., gemcitabine
 and fluorouracil) and platinum-based antineoplastics (e.g., oxaliplatin) are commonly used as chemotherapy
 for PC. When administered as free drugs, gemcitabine (Gem), fluorouracil (5-FU) and oxaliplatin (Oxa) display
 significant off-target toxicity causing life-threatening adverse effects in many patients. There is an urgent need
 to develop new therapeutic strategies consisting of delivery vehicles able to target PC cells, limit Gem, 5-FU
 and Oxa off-target toxicity and improve the overall anticancer response.
 We have recently patented a platform that uses an unbiased and quantitative screening algorithm for the
 discovery and validation of cancer-specific surface antigens. Our recently published results show that
 Intercellular Adhesion Molecule 1 (ICAM1), a transmembrane glycoprotein of the immunoglobulin superfamily,
 is aberrantly overexpressed in PC and can serve as a PC-specific target. Our results suggest that developing
 a novel ICAM1-based precision nanomedicine can be successfully utilized to treat PC patients.
 We have recently developed a magnetic extrusion technique to synthesize endosome-derived vesicles
 called exosome mimetics (EMs) in a highly efficient and reproducible manner. Our EMs share the same
 biological origin, morphology, nanosize and composition with exosomes, a class of natural cell-secreted
 extracellular vesicles. Our EM synthesis outperforms conventionally used exosome isolation and loading
 protocols in terms of particle yield, batch-to-batch consistency, reproducibility and loading efficiency.
 In this proposal,we leverage our expertise in cancer-specific antigen discovery and validation, bio-
 nanomaterial engineering, and exosome biology to test the novel hypothesis that EMs expressing ICAM1
 nanobody and loaded with Gem, 5-FU and Oxa can be used as a novel delivery vehicle for PC therapy. We
 will synthesize EMs engineered with ICAM1 nanobodies that recognize and kill ICAM1-expressing PC cells
 and load them with Gem, 5-FU and Oxa. ICAM1-EM will exhibit increased tumor specificity and reduce Gem,
 5FU and Oxa off-target delivery and toxicity. These innovative studies have the potential to lead to the
 development of novel EM-based therapies that can improve the efficacy of current cancer drug delivery.
 With key experimental tools, in vivo models and extensive experience in place, we will address the
 following Specific Aims:
1. To engineer ICAM1-targeted exosome mimetics (ICAM1-EMs) using magnetic extrusion method
2. To determine the efficacy of loaded ICAM1-Chemo-EMs in inhibiting PC growth and progression
3. To determine the pharmacokinetics (PK) and biodistribution of loaded ICAM1-Chemo-EMs

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Project Summary
Valvular heart disease is an important health problem afflicting over 2.5% of the US population and catheter-
based therapies to address it have advanced significantly in recent years. While surgical repair remains the
gold standard, the reduced risk of catheter-based interventions has provided the ability to intervene earlier in
the disease process and in patients too sick for surgery while avoiding the risks of cardiopulmonary bypass.
A significant limitation of these procedures, however, is that they do not provide the capability to remove
native tissue and previously implanted devices to tailor the anatomy to receive a new prosthetic device. For
example, transcatheter valves rely on displacing the diseased valve leaflets rather than removing them. In
transcatheter aortic valve replacement, the displaced leaflets can obstruct blood flow to the coronary arteries
and prevent access for subsequent coronary interventions. In transcatheter mitral valve replacement, the
native anterior leaflet can be forced into the left ventricular outflow tract resulting in restricted flow into the
aorta. Recently, a transcatheter technique has been introduced to lacerate a leaflet along its midline from
base to tip. When performed prior to transcatheter valve replacement, the new valve spreads the two halves
of the old leaflet apart so that they do not interfere with blood flow. This innovative approach can increase the
number of patients who qualify for these low-risk procedures. Since the procedure relies on the use of existing
guidewires and catheters, however, it is technically challenging, requires multiple clinicians to perform and
takes more time than valve replacement. Furthermore, the electrosurgical ablation used in these procedures
is not as effective for calcified tissue which is often present in native and bioprosthetic leaflets. To address
this need, we propose to develop a catheter-based technology that enables a single operator to perform
precise cutting of native and bioprosthetic leaflets regardless of calcification. In Aim 1, we will develop a
steerable cardioscopically-guided leaflet cutting catheter. We will develop and demonstrate the technology in
the context of aortic and mitral leaflet modification using electrosurgical cutting. In Aim 2, we will create a
laser-based leaflet cutting system to address the limitations of electrosurgery in calcified tissue. The
technology will be evaluated through in vivo testing and comparison with existing methods. Key innovations
of this research include real-time optical visualization of leaflets during cutting, the ability to cut a leaflet without
forming a wire loop through it, the development of laser-based cutting to precisely lacerate calcified tissue
and the characterization of emboli produced by leaflet laceration. This technology can provide a platform for
the future development of more sophisticated transcatheter tissue modification and device removal
procedures.

Glaucoma and other optic neuropathies are characterized by retinal ganglion cell (RGC) non-regenerative
axon damage and eventual cell death. Optic nerve crush (ONC), which transects all RGC axons, is often used
to model this process, and to seek interventions that preserve RGCs and promote regeneration of their axons.
Following ONC in mice, ~80% of the RGCs die within 2 weeks, and virtually none of the survivors regenerate
axons. We and others have used ONC to identify interventions that lead to increased survival, increased
regeneration or both. However, these treatments are only partially effective and many relevant targets are not
well-suited for the clinic. It is therefore important to identify additional and improved promoters of survival and
regeneration. Kinases are key regulators of cellular responses to insults and stresses. Furthermore, because
of their discrete enzymatic activity, kinases are druggable targets. Thus, we performed a preliminary in vivo
CRISPR-assisted kinase screen paired with ONC in adult mice to determine which kinases prevent RGC
survival and axon regeneration. To our excitement, the first round of screening through 750 kinases identified
17 anti-survival and 5 anti-regenerative hits. Many of these hits represent new mechanistic and translational
insights. In the proposed study, we will first examine the mechanistic underpinnings of two novel target kinase
pathways (namely LKB1/SNRK and Mkk4/Mkk7) that we have already verified the efficacy of with larger
experimental cohorts beyond our preliminary screen. These experiments will allow us to more completely
understand their mechanisms of action to formulate ideal therapeutic interventions. Additionally, we will
complete the validation of our remaining target kinases with full experimental cohorts in the ONC model.
Finally, we will choose the most promising gRNAs with robust neuroprotective effects and test their ability to
protect RGCs in our recently developed glaucoma model. At the completion of these studies, we expect to
be well-positioned to leverage the knowledge generated here into druggable targets to treat multiple
conditions causing blindness.

 Endothelial cell (EC) dysfunction is a key factor that promotes poor host defense, pro-thrombotic
cardiovascular complications and bleeding during respiratory viral infections. The applicant’s laboratory has
made long-standing contributions in vascular effects of sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), a circulating lipid
mediator important for EC resilience. This protective pathway is preferentially activated by HDL-bound S1P, thus
counteracting EC dysfunction and pathophysiology. However, the role of S1P in influenza viral infections in the
context of thrombosis and bleeding complications is poorly understood. This proposal develops a novel paradigm
to enhance vascular resilience while minimizing thrombotic and bleeding complications during virus-induced
pulmonary injury. We have developed designer HDL-like nanoparticles that chaperone S1P, namely, ApoA1-
ApoM (A1M)/S1P, for therapeutic activation of EC S1PR1 and suppression of vascular leak. A1M/S1P either
alone or together with other barrier protective agents such as angiopoietin-1 (ANGPT-1) and prostacyclin (PGI2)
enhanced EC barrier function in endothelial cells. In addition, the ApoA1 moiety of A1M suppressed cytokine-
induced NFkB activation and inflammatory gene expression. We hypothesize that sustained activation of
S1PR1/Gi signaling by HDL-S1P and cooperative interactions between EC protective pathways (ANGPT1/
Tie2 and PGI2/IP receptor) enhances pulmonary vascular recovery from respiratory viral infections
without inducing prothrombotic transformation of the endothelium. Specific aim 1 will evaluate HDL-S1P
activation of protective endothelial S1PR1/Gi signaling. Genetic mouse models of S1PR1 loss of function (EC
knockout), gain of function (EC transgenic) and Gi-biased signaling (S5A phosphorylation-defective mutant),
Apom KO or Apom TG mice will be analyzed to determine alveolar microvascular leak, integrity, thrombosis,
bleeding and resolution of inflammation during influenza virus-induced pneumonitis. Single cell (sc)RNA-seq
data from mice with viral pneumonitis will be deconvoluted to determine molecular mechanisms of paracrine
signal networks between EC and pericytes important in microvascular resilience. The second aim will determine
the mechanisms by which albumin-S1P/S1PR1 signaling in EC promotes thrombosis in the context of viral
infection. We will use Tie2 agonists together with EC-targeted S1PR1 agonists to control bleeding in the setting
of influenza infection. The third aim will develop combinatorial therapeutic approaches containing novel HDL-like
nanoparticles and Tie2 activators to suppress EC injury and thromboinflammation during viral host defense
responses. Designer HDL particles containing S1P that enhances the vascular resilience and HDL particles that
carry stable prostacyclin (PGI2) analogs will be combined with Tie2 activators to suppress thrombosis and
bleeding in lung on chip and mouse models. Together, this proposal aims to achieve a mechanistic
understanding of EC pathophysiology during respiratory viral infections and develop novel therapeutic strategies.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Infantile nystagmus syndrome is an involuntary oscillatory movement of the eyes that begins in infancy and
persists throughout life. It is visually and socially debilitating. The underlying pathophysiology is poorly
understood, and no effective treatments exist. More than half of infantile nystagmus patients have an associated
retinal or optic nerve disorder. Nystagmus is thus thought to develop secondary to poor vision, suggesting that
proper development of the oculomotor system is dependent on visual input, particularly in the first two months
of life. The long-term goal of this research is to understand the pathophysiologic mechanisms in nystagmus
and identify potential new therapeutic targets. Extraocular muscles (EOMs) from patients with infantile
nystagmus display a number of abnormalities, including decreased innervation, small neuromuscular junctions,
and an increased proportion of slow myofibers. We have recently shown that these changes are also present
in a mouse model of nystagmus—albino mice—and that the first changes are present as early as P10, before
eye opening. The human samples also show central nucleation of muscle fibers and an increase in expression
of the immature form of acetylcholine receptor on the fast myofibers. These changes suggest that there is
continuous remodeling of the EOM innervation in nystagmus. Different EOM myofiber types are innervated by
different subtypes of oculomotor neurons (OMNs), which in turn receive different premotor inputs. The “fast”
and “slow” OMNs, which innervate fast and slow myofibers, respectively, have different roles in different types
of eye movements. EOMs, OMNs, and premotor inputs are all dependent on each other for survival. This leads
to the hypothesis that nystagmus results from improper development of the oculomotor circuitry. This proposal
aims to test this hypothesis in a mouse model of infantile nystagmus syndrome by (1) determining whether
OMN survival and subtype distribution are altered and how the developmental timing of any changes relate to
changes in EOM innervation and nystagmus onset and (2) determining whether the premotor synaptic inputs to
the OMNs develop abnormally in mice with nystagmus. Albino mice, which display spontaneous nystagmus,
will be assessed for changes in EOM innervation and myofiber subtypes and corresponding differences in
OMN survival and subtype distribution. Age of onset of nystagmus will be determined. Viral transsynaptic
tracing will delineate the first-order synaptic connections onto the ocular motor nuclei. In all experiments, albino
mice will be compared to wild-type littermates, obtained from heterozygous matings, to control for genetic
background. Multiple developmental timepoints will be assessed to determine the point in development when
changes associated with nystagmus occur; whether changes in the EOMs, OMNs, or premotor inputs occur
first; and which changes precede nystagmus onset. This research will provide fundamental knowledge into the
mechanisms of infantile nystagmus. Understanding where and when the abnormalities in infantile nystagmus
first arise is the first step in identifying potential therapeutic targets or preventative interventions.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Project Summary: Brain MRIs are widely used in children for diagnosis and treatment monitoring. A typical
exam comprises multiple sequences with different contrast preparations, and often requires 20+ minutes to
complete. Potential motion during such lengthy acquisitions necessitates sedation or anesthesia. However,
repeated sedation or anesthesia in children increase the risk of long-term detrimental effects on cognitive
development. 40% of these pediatric scans also require gadolinium (Gd) based contrast agent (GBCA)
administration. It has been recently shown that Gd is retained in the brain and body, which may be particularly
harmful to children since their developing brains are more susceptible to heavy metal exposure, and free
lanthanides are known to be neurotoxic. Pediatric brain exams are excessively long because of inefficient use
of parallel imaging technology that only provides R=2–3-fold acceleration. Acceleration in two dimensions,
including the slice/partition axis, through controlled aliasing in parallel imaging (CAIPI) has enabled R=4–6-fold
speed-up, and has become popular in functional/diffusion imaging using simultaneous multislice (SMS)
encoding. Unfortunately, adoption of SMS in clinical sequences has been extremely slow. Acceleration via
Compressed Sensing (CS) is a promising solution, but its availability as a product solution is variable among
MR vendors, and it often comes at the cost of low-contrast image features. Deep learning (DL) has emerged
as a powerful reconstruction and image enhancement tool. Vendors’ DL solutions include denoising and super-
resolution enhancement, but these are limited to the newest software versions and host computers with GPUs.
While promising a better trade-off between image quality and scan time, they are currently implemented for a
small number of sequences on different vendors, and are therefore constrained by poor availability and
scalability. Thus, current clinical technologies have been hampered by limited availability and faster has often
meant suboptimal quality. Lastly, no vendor has DL-based solutions for Gd dose reduction for either adults or
children. Given the need for repeated injections of sedatives and GBCA in children who are scanned
periodically for treatment monitoring, there is an unmet need in imaging technology that makes these young
populations vulnerable to severe and long-term health risks. We propose data acquisition, reconstruction and
contrast enhancement strategies to address this unmet need. In Aim1, we will develop a rapid, comprehensive
brain exam by combining our advanced controlled aliasing strategy, wave-CAIPI, and extend this to SMS
encoding for rapid FLAIR/TSE imaging. Combining this with DL super-resolution reconstruction will enable
R=9-fold acceleration with high fidelity to create a 6-min protocol. In Aim2, we will develop and validate a DL-
based contrast enhancement algorithm to synthesize full dose images from 5× reduced Gd dose in pediatric
exams using our rapid protocol from Aim1. To that end, our novel technologies would speed up the clinical MR
exams and minimize both the amount of sedation and the injected contrast agents dose in children.

T cell-B cell interactions that result in B cell maturation and antibody production were once thought to occur
exclusively in lymphoid organs. It is now appreciated that T peripheral helper (Tph) cells provide excessive
help to B cells resulting in autoantibody production in inflamed peripheral tissues. Such disordered Tph cell-B
cell responses have been implicated in some forms of chronic inflammatory arthritis in both adults and children.
The pathways that regulate the Tph cell-B cell axis in non-lymphoid tissues are not understood.
By studying joint fluid from patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), we found evidence of dysregulated
Tph cell-B cell responses in children with early-onset and anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) positive forms of the
disease. Our preliminary studies also identified a novel T cell subset, T peripheral regulatory (Tpr) cells, in
the joints of patients with JIA. These Tpr cells co-express regulatory T (Treg) and B cell-helper T cell factors.
Further, Tpr cells have the ability to inhibit Tph cell-B cell interactions that result in plasmablast generation in
our T cell-B cell co-culture system. The central hypothesis of this application is that Tpr cells restrain Tph cell-B
cell interactions in the joints of patients with inflammatory arthritis.
The central hypothesis in this research proposal will be tested with two Specific Aims that will be conducted
with biosamples (peripheral blood, synovial fluid, tonsil tissue) from children with JIA as well as healthy
controls. Through our established T cell-B cell co-culture system, Aim1 will assess the mechanisms by which
Tpr cells regulate Tph cell-B cell interactions. We will test the hypothesis that Tpr cells are uniquely equipped
to inhibit proliferation and cytokine production in B cell-helper T cells as well as antibody production, class
switching, and maturation in B cells by inducing alterations in gene expression and metabolism. Using a
multiomics approach coupled with functional assays, Aim 2 will define the developmental pathways and
transcriptional program required for Tpr functionality. We will test the hypothesis that Tpr cells differentiate from
Treg cells in the joint and have a unique transcriptional program that is distinct from other Treg subsets and
ensures Tpr functionality in tissues.
The research is innovative because we will use a systems immunology approach coupled with synovial fluid
samples from children with JIA to study T cell-B cell responses directly from affected tissues. Completion of
this research will be significant because Tpr cells represent a novel regulatory pathway with the capacity to
restrain Tph cell-B cell responses and ameliorate tissue-specific inflammation in arthritis and other autoimmune
diseases.

of proteins. This breakthrough understanding was brought about in 2015 when gasdermin D
(GSDMD) was identified as a downstream effector of inflammasomes, which are supramolecular
complexes that activate inflammatory caspases (-1, -4 and -5 in human and -1 and -11 in mouse).
GSDMD gets cleaved by caspases to generate an N-terminal fragment (GSDMD-NT) and a C-
terminal fragment (GSDMD-CT), and GSDMD-NT was shown to mediate pyroptosis, as well as
the release of IL-1 family cytokines, which are processed by caspase-1 to the mature form. The
GSDM family comprises six members in humans (GSDMA, GSDMB, GSDMC, GSDMD,
GSDME/DFNA5, and DFNB59). In 2021, Ninjurin1 (NINJ1), a member of the NINJ family
comprised of 2 transmembrane proteins in mammals, was shown to act downstream of GSDMD
pore formation to induce the plasma membrane rupture required for full release of damage-
associated molecular patterns (DAMP) such as lactate dehydrogenase (LDH).
We and others found that upon cleavage by inflammatory caspases, GSDMD-NT specifically
binds to acidic lipids, and exhibits strong membrane-disrupting cytotoxicity in mammalian cells by
forming pores on membranes during pyroptosis and in vitro. Other GSDMs, upon cleavage by
appropriate proteases, also form transmembrane pores.
Here we propose to elucidate the structural mechanism of pore formation by the GSDM family,
and of membrane disruption by NINJ1. Understanding how GSDMs are regulated and exert their
pore forming activity, and how NINJ1 oligomerizes to induce plasma membrane rupture will not
only provide new insights on pyroptosis, but also afford new therapeutic strategies for treating
inflammasome-related and pyroptosis-related diseases.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Proper functions of all immune systems rely on maintenance of immune homeostasis. One family of immune
cells that play key roles in immune homeostasis are regulatory T cells (Tregs), a subset of T cells that prevent
excessive inflammation and autoimmunity. Tregs differentiate from naïve T cells in a manner that depends on
the transcription factor FoxP3. Loss-of-function mutations in FoxP3 lead to fatal multi-organ autoimmune and
inflammatory conditions. Despite the importance, the molecular functions and mechanisms of FoxP3 remain
poorly understood. We have recently made a significant progress in our structural approach to understand the
versatile mode of DNA recognition by FoxP3. We determined the crystal structure of FoxP3 in complex with
DNA (Leng et al, Immunity, 2022), breaking the decades-old dogma that FoxP3 forms a domain-swap dimer.
More recently, we found that FoxP3 recognizes a new motif composed of TnG repeats by forming a novel
multimeric assembly and that this is accompanied by bridging of two DNA molecules (unpublished). Additional
preliminary data suggest that this mode of DNA binding also occurs in Treg cells and is important for FoxP3
functions. These findings suggest an exciting new model: unique functions of FoxP3 in Treg development is
mediated by its ability to recognize TnG repeats and to form or stabilize DNA loops. We here propose three
aims to test and further develop this model. Aim 1 is to determine the cryo-EM structure of the FoxP3
multimers in complex with TnG repeats and to validate the structural mechanism using a combination of
biochemistry and cellular immunology. Aim 2 is to investigate functional consequence of such assemblies in T
cells using genomic approaches, such as ChIP-seq and HiChIP. Aim 3 is to identify and characterize the direct
interacting partners of FoxP3 that mediate its transcriptional function, and to investigate the role of FoxP3
multimerization on its interactome.
 Together, the proposed research builds upon a strong set of exciting findings from my lab and will have a
broad impact on TFs beyond FoxP3. That is, it will help understand how TFs can utilize a multimeric scaffold to
recognize new sequence motifs and alter chromatin conformation. Additionally, TnG repeats belong to a group
of genetic elements called microsatellites, which are often thought as “junk” or pathogenic. Thus, our work also
implicates a novel role for microsatellites in transcriptional regulation and, at the same time, FoxP3 as one of
the first exemplary TFs that exploit microsatellites for their functions.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
Malaria is an important global cause of morbidity and mortality. Most of this disease burden falls on children
and pregnant women and is caused by infection with Plasmodium falciparum. The signs and symptoms of
human malaria result from the exponential expansion of parasite biomass that occurs during asexual
replication of parasites in human red blood cells. During this clinically important blood stage, P. falciparum
parasites divide by schizogony – a process wherein components for several daughter cells are produced
within a common cytoplasm prior to a complex and synchronized cytokinesis known as segmentation.
Cytokinesis via segmentation is highly divergent from the process of cell division in human cells. The
generation of the invasive daughter parasites, known as merozoites, occurs with high fidelity, ensuring that
each daughter has a single nucleus and the required organelles. The fundamental molecular mechanisms
that facilitate segmentation are incompletely understand, and this is a significant knowledge gap.
Successful segmentation requires two parasite-specific structures, the inner membrane complex (IMC) and
the basal complex. The IMC is a double lipid bilayer with associated proteins that, together with an
underlying cytoskeletal network, dictates parasite shape and rigidity. The basal complex is a group of
proteins at the posterior (i.e., basal) end of the IMC. This multi-protein molecular machine is essential for
parasite cell division and is hypothesized to facilitate proper biogenesis of the IMC, likely to contribute to cell
shape, and to mediate the final abscission step of cytokinesis. In the current proposal, we will move
stepwise towards a molecular understanding of basal complex function. We have a high-confidence list of
basal complex components, and our preliminary data demonstrate that individual proteins define
subcompartments within the complex and dynamically join and depart the complex. In the first aim, we will
utilize high-resolution live-cell time lapse microscopy to determine the precise order of assembly and
disassembly of the basal complex. In the second aim, we will utilize super-resolution ultrastructure
expansion microscopy to localize individual proteins into subcompartments of the basal complex and
proximity labeling to identify novel components within these compartments. In the third aim, we evaluate the
requirement for the remaining basal complex components for segmentation and determine the minimal core
of proteins that are essential for basal complex function. In summary, the basal complex is essential for
asexual replication of P. falciparum, is insufficiently understood, and is not targeted by any current
therapeutics. The studies in this proposal will narrow the significant knowledge gap around the molecular
mechanisms of basal complex function and may identify important targets for future antimalarials.

The long-term goal of this proposal is developed to uncover the molecular mechanisms and identify
critical regulators governing lymphatic vascular function in health and disease in hopes of offering
potential new therapeutic targets to combat cardiovascular and metabolic disorders. At the third year
of postdoctoral training, the PI has published his first postdoctoral project and presented his studies in
several prestigious conferences that pave the way for his transition to an independent investigator.
The lymphatic system is responsible for maintaining interstitial fluid homeostasis, immune cell
trafficking and lipid absorption. Lymphatic function participates largely in the pathogenesis of metabolic
and cardiovascular diseases such as obesity and atherosclerosis. How lymphatic dysfunction leads to
abnormal lipid transport and fat deposition, and conversely, how these metabolic diseases impair
lymphatic function are poorly understood but highly medically relevant questions. Embryonic mice
lacking Foxc2, a key transcription factor, prevents the formation and maturation of collecting lymphatic
vessels. Despite the crucial role of Foxc2 in lymphatic development and remodeling, little is known
about the role of Foxc2 in adult physiological and pathological lymphatic function; limitation is largely
due to a lack of appropriate animal models. In this proposed application, the PI recently has generated
novel inducible lymphatic endothelial cell (LEC)-specific Foxc2 gain-of-function and Foxc2 loss-of-
function mice. Utilizing these powerful genetic tools, the PI observed that deficiency of LEC Foxc2 in
adult mice dramatically increased the lymphangiogensis, improves impaired lymphatic drainage and
lipid absorption in metabolic disorders (unpublished data). In the K99 phase, the PI will continue the
current project to determine the molecular mechanism by which Foxc2 regulates adult
lymphangiogenesis and lymphatic function in obese model. While in R00 phase, the PI will investigate
the role of Foxc2 in modulating macrophage cholesterol efflux and reverse cholesterol transport in
atherosclerotic model, as well as how Foxc2 will affect atherogenesis, which is diverging from his
mentor’s work on Epsin, a family of endocytic adaptor proteins. Moreover, other than the unique mouse
models and cutting-edge techniques, the PI will develop a novel LEC-specific nanoparticle delivery
system based on his recent published platform to specifically target LEC Foxc2, thus may halt
inflammation and inhibit atheroma progression. This proposal will be valuable for restoring impaired
lymphatics to treat cardiovascular and metabolic diseases.

 The objective of this proposal is to gain a deeper understanding of the genetic programs that give rise
to the development of specialized areas within the human cerebral cortex. Abnormalities in cortical
development can lead to a wide range of neurodevelopmental disorders, which often affect different cortical
areas differently. Despite of its significance, the process by which specialized areas develop remains poorly
understood. This proposal aims to address this gap of knowledge by studying primary tissue and human stem
cell-derived brain organoids. The first aspect of the research will utilize spatially resolved transcriptome
analysis to examine human fetal cortex samples from multiple areas and embryonic ages, to identify the genes
that are involved in area-specific neuronal fate specification. The second part will focus on developing the
method for inducing areal identities in human brain organoids by pharmacological manipulation of signaling
pathways, serving as a model for how morphogens induce area-specific cell fates in vivo. The proposed aims
are attainable due to the strong background of the candidate and supportive environment provided by the
mentor’s laboratory and the institution. The anticipated outcome of this research will be new insights into the
principles of human cortical development, which could shed light on the etiology of neurodevelopmental
disorders and ultimately transform our understanding of cortical development in health and disease.
 The candidate’s career goal is to become an independent researcher in an academic institution, leading
a research program that utilizes human stem cell models and neurogenetics approaches to study
neurodevelopmental disorders. The candidate’s prior research in the development and application of organoids
as model for human brain development and diseases sets a strong foundation. The proposal outlines a
comprehensive plan for scientific and professional growth that encompasses hands-on training, didactics, and
mentorship. Key scientific training goals include acquiring expertise in single-cell bioinformatics, spatial
transcriptomics, disease genetics analysis, and conducting rigorous optimization of organoid protocols.
Additionally, the candidate will engage in structured trainings in career development to facilitate independence.
The candidate will be mentored by Dr. Christopher Walsh, a renowned neuroscientist who has mentored
dozens of successful independent investigators. The candidate will also benefit from the support of an advisory
committee with complementary expertise. The mentored phase of the proposal will take place in the laboratory
of Dr. Walsh at Boston Children’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School, known for providing exceptional
research and training environments. The proposed training and research will provide the candidate with the
necessary resources and support to establish a thriving independent research program.

Hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) is a fatal form of congenital heart disease characterized by the
underdevelopment of left-sided structures, including the left ventricle (LV), mitral and aortic valves, and
ascending aorta. These three structural deficiencies result in diminished circulation that invariably leads to
morbidity without surgical intervention. It is currently thought that HLHS is an oligogenic disease of co-
occurring structural defects caused by different genetic lesions. In some cases, however, one structural defect
might be primary and the others secondary. As HLHS is clinically heterogeneous, there are likely multiple paths
to disease pathogenesis caused by diverse, and often unknown, genetic etiologies. To begin studying the
affected genes in the context of heart development, I mined published databases for de novo and rare
inherited variants in HLHS probands for follow-up in zebrafish. I initially selected RBFOX2, a highly conserved
RNA binding protein (RBP), based on its strong statistical link to HLHS and lack of study in cardiac
development. I published that rbfox2 mutant zebrafish display all three HLHS-like structural heart defects that
arise secondary to compromised pump function (Huang et al. Nat Commun 2022). However, unlike patients
that are heterozygous for RBFOX2, heterozygous zebrafish and mice are healthy. Therefore, no appropriate
model exists to investigate how halving the dose of RBFOX2 affects CM biology. Moreover, many variants
statistically linked to HLHS remain unvalidated or unstudied in whole animal models. To address these
knowledge gaps, I engineered and characterized RBFOX2 het and null human (h) iPSC-CMs. Both genetic
cohorts show dose-dependent reductions in cell size, cell adhesion, calcium handling, and oxygen
consumption rates. Myofibril alignment is also perturbed. Based on this phenotypic characterization and
integration of several sequencing datasets, I propose to test the hypothesis that RBFOX2 directly regulates CM
cell adhesion and growth by controlling transcript stability and splicing of an ECM-cytoskeletal-myofibril gene
network in Aim 1. To identify additional HLHS-linked variants that cause cardiac phenotypes in zebrafish, I
conducted a pilot CRISPR screen and recovered an ortholog of FOXC2, which encodes a transcription factor
expressed in the endocardium and myocardium. Preliminary phenotyping revealed HLHS-like cardiac
phenotypes in foxc2 global knock-outs that also fail to activate a Notch reporter in the endocardium. In Aim 2, I
propose to test the hypothesis that endocardial-specific FOXC2-deficiency leads to primary valve and
secondary myocardial defects caused by defective Notch signaling. Overall, I anticipate learning that both
myocardial- and endocardial-intrinsic defects recapitulate specific aspects of HLHS. More broadly, implicating
human variants as causal for HLHS pathogenesis and deciphering their mechanism of action in whole animal
and human iPSC models will ultimately lead to better predictors of heart failure following surgical intervention
and new therapeutic inroads for patient-specific clinical management of the disease.

Candidate: Dr. Medina Jackson-Browne, PhD is an environmental epidemiologist with primary research
interests in the role of early-life environmental chemical exposures on the immune and respiratory systems
in children. The goal of this proposal is to obtain training in the skills to build Dr. Jackson-Browne’s research
career in pediatric clinical research. We propose several initiatives to strengthen Dr. Jackson-Browne’s
career. Specifically, Dr. Jackson-Browne will gain new research skills and enhance her understanding of
1) the clinical trial process with Dr. Phipatanakul, MD, 2) train in early-childhood immune system
development and respiratory physiology and 3) translate this research and training to position her for a
future R01. To achieve this goal, she will obtain training in clinical trial design, database design and
management, and advanced biostatistical methods. This will be accomplished with formal coursework,
collaborative work, attendance at conferences, and guidance from established mentors/scientific advisors
with relevant expertise. The proposed research and training plan builds the foundation for an independent
research career that aims to address gaps in the understanding of timing and mechanism through which
environmental chemical exposure affect respiratory health in early childhood.
Research: Early-life exposure to environmental chemicals, particularly chemical’s known to bioaccumulate
in humans, is of increasing concern in the development of asthma in children. Aeroallergen sensitization
is a pivotal risk factor for developing persistent, progressive asthma throughout life and sensitized children
have a higher prevalence of early-life wheeze and poor lung function. These potential associations are
particularly relevant to populations with higher exposure to these chemicals and those at a higher risk for
developing and/or dying from complications from asthma such as Black and low-income urban children.
This proposal details a five-year plan to provide Dr. Jackson-Browne with the training and expertise to
address gaps in the understanding of the timing through which perfluoroalkyl substance (PFAS) exposures
may affect asthma development in children by leveraging infrastructure of an on-going pediatric clinical
trial of 2-3-year-old infants at high risk of developing asthma (PI, Dr. Wanda Phipatanakul, MD).
Environment: Dr. Jackson-Browne will be mentored by Dr. Phipatanakul, an expert in epidemiology,
clinical trials, and clinical investigation in asthma and allergic diseases. She has assembled an
extraordinary team of advisors, including Drs. Jessie Buckley, Stephanie Lovinsky-Desir and Suzanne
Dahlberg who have committed their time, resources, and expertise to facilitate Dr. Jackson-Browne’s
career development and successful completion of the proposed project. The academic environment
created Boston Children’s Hospital and their affiliates provides an ideal training environment specific to
her goals of achieving research independence.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
Perinatal white matter injury (WMI) is a common sequela of neonatal brain injury. One of the leading causes
of neonatal brain injury and morbidity in premature infants is post-hemorrhagic hydrocephalus (PHH). PHH is
triggered by germinal matrix and/or intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) that results in accumulation of
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the brain ventricles. This accumulation of CSF can cause compression of
surrounding brain tissue and injury to the developing white matter. Specifically, in PHH the degree of
ventricular dilation is correlated with severity of WMI as measured by decreased myelination and increased
axonal injury, cellularity, and cytoplasmic vacuolation. Myelination in the central nervous system (CNS) has
been previously identified as dependent upon Autotaxin (ATX), which can be sourced via the CSF. The
choroid plexus (ChP) is the tissue which controls the amount and composition of the CSF and therefore helps
instruct the developing nervous system. Here, we examine expression and availability of ChP-secreted ATX
influencing white matter development and myelination of the mouse CNS and hypothesize this may be an
important signaling axis which could be therapeutically harnessed to treat WMI associated with PHH. The
Lehtinen Lab's single nucleus sequencing data demonstrates ATX expression across all epithelial cell
clusters, thereby suggesting the epithelial cells may secrete ATX into the CSF. In preliminary studies we
confirm that the ChP secretes ATX and show that ATX abundance in the ChP and CSF increase throughout
development, with a particularly noticeable upregulation in the critical postnatal window associated with
myelination of the CNS in mouse. In Aim 1, I will determine the effect of ChP-specific ATX modulation on
myelination using advanced in vivo mouse manipulation techniques to selectively delete or overexpress ATX
in the ChP. In Aim 2, I will further explore role for ATX in the pathophysiological mechanisms of WMI using
the lab's translationally relevant mouse model of neonatal PHH following IVH. The results of these studies
will inform our understanding of the mechanisms of hemorrhage induced WMI and will help guide rational
intervention strategies for treatment, thereby improving quality of life for patients and caregivers. The
proposed research will take place at Boston Children's Hospital under the guidance of Dr. Maria Lehtinen, an
expert in the field of choroid plexus and CSF biology, and will provide training in ChP in vivo manipulation
techniques, glial biology, exposure to clinical experience, and in the design of translationally relevant
preclinical studies. We will routinely consult with collaborators and mentors who are experts on both white
matter development and the neurologic sequelae associated with PHH of prematurity. The results from this
proposal will result in first-authored publications and a large body of support for a K99/R00 application, with
the goal of launching an independent academic career.

 Providing molecular fingerprint vibration information and high imaging speed, coherent Raman scattering
microscopy, based on either coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) or stimulated Raman scattering
(SRS), allows real-time vibrational imaging of living cells and/or tissues with sub-micron spatial resolution These
instrumentation-based advances, however, do not fulfill all the desired parameters in hyperspectral imaging,
including broad bandwidth, high signal to noise ratio (SNR) and high speed. In pushing these physical limits, it
is common that one parameter is optimized at the price of sacrificing other advantages. The current proposal
aims to break this conventional thinking of "no free lunch in optimization" through a synergistic integration of
advanced instrumentation and data science. A multidisciplinary team with a strong track record of collaborations
will pursue the proposed studies. Ji-Xin Cheng (PI) is a leading expert in the development and applications of
SRS chemical imaging. Lei Tian (co-I) is a leading expert in computational microscopy and machine learning.
Daniela Matei (co-I) is a leading expert in cancer research specialized in ovarian cancer. We aim to develop two
complementary platforms that will allow high-speed, high-content, and high-sensitivity mapping of cell
metabolism. The first platform is for samples without prior knowledge. We will build a polygon scanner to tune
the delay between two chirped pulses on a 20-microsecond time scale. We will then deploy deep spatial-spectral
learning to denoise the low-SNR hyperspectral measurements and extract salient information with much
enhanced SNR. This integrated approach effectively bypasses the conventional tradeoff between acquisition
speed and SNR and enables high-speed, high-throughput, hyperspectral SRS imaging using informative
fingerprint Raman bands. The second platform is for samples with known target species. We will develop a
sparsely sampled hyperspectral imaging strategy to increase the overall speed by one order of magnitude while
maintaining the same SNR. We will develop a novel "recursive feature elimination" approach to determine the
minimum number of essential frames. On the instrumentation side, a fast-tuning fiber laser will be deployed to
acquire a sparsely sampled hyperspectral stack within one second for the study of living systems. As a focused
application, we will apply the proposed platforms to systematically investigate metabolic reprogramming in
ovarian cancers that are cisplatin resistant. Our focused application will unveil hidden signatures that are
associated with drug resistance, which will open new opportunities for improved treatment of drug-resistant
cancers.

Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a progressive neurological condition affecting up to 1% of older adults, over 90% of
whom experience speech problems. These speech problems cause reductions in quality of life, as measured by
patient-centered outcomes (PCOs) of communicative participation, speech intelligibility, and naturalness, with
further declines as the disease progresses. Decrements in PCOs can be attributed to changes in underlying
physiological mechanisms of speech (i.e., the respiratory, laryngeal, and articulatory subsystems), yet the
relative contributions of changes in speech physiology to PCOs are unknown. Without this knowledge, precious
therapy time may be wasted on addressing physiological changes that do not matter to the patient experience.
Defining the relationships between speech physiology and PCOs would allow clinicians to focus on physiological
changes that are important to the patient. Furthermore, since many clinical settings do not have the resources
to implement physiological measures, research is needed to determine which clinically accessible acoustic
assessments are related to the individualized changes in speech physiology that drive changes in PCOs. We
propose a comprehensive, longitudinal study of PCOs, physiology, and acoustics in a large sample, which
should provide novel outcomes for clinical translation. In Aim 1, we will compare longitudinal changes in PCOs
in PD to concomitant changes in speech physiology. Regardless of whether we see group-level changes, this
aim will provide physiological targets that are tied to PCOs in the individuals who decline during the study period.
In Aim 2, we will develop and evaluate a refined set of acoustic correlates of speech decline in PD based on
their relationships with respiratory, laryngeal, and articulatory physiology. Finally, in Aim 3, we will
psychometrically assess the sensitivity to change of the measures of speech physiology and the acoustic
correlates. The ability of a measure to appropriately reflect change over time is a critical characteristic, essential
for measures to be used for clinical or research applications. To comprehensively assess sensitivity to change,
we will examine both decreasing (due to disease progression) and increasing (due to improvement with
behavioral cueing – clear speech) function. Our results will provide a roadmap for future evidence-based
treatment. Based on a physiological or acoustic evaluation, clinicians will be able to target specific speech
subsystems to improve PCOs. This work will guide the future development of personalized treatment for
individuals with PD.

CM comprises enlarged vessels lined with sprouting endothelial cells (EC) and disorganized mural cells. In
Sturge Weber Syndrome (SWS), a neurocutaneous disorder, CM occurs in the skin, brain, and eyes. Patients
may suffer from seizures, strokes, glaucoma, and only symptomatic treatment is available. CM is caused by a
somatic mutation in GNAQ, the gene that encodes the a-subunit of the G-protein – Gaq. The GNAQ mutation
– the arginine (R) at the amino acid position of 183 replaced by the glutamine (Q) – is enriched in ECs isolated
from CM in the skin, brain, and choroidal vessels of the eye. To date, little is known about how the R183Q
point mutation in the Gaq activation domain leads to abnormal capillaries. Moreover, nothing is known about
the interactions between the mutant EC and neighboring mural cells surrounding CM vessels. Our preliminary
data suggest that lentiviral transduced human EC expressing the R183Q allele (EC-R183Q) have high levels of
pro-inflammatory markers, a weaker junctional barrier, and exhibit heightened response to laminar shear
stress. Immunostaining of CM tissue sections also reveal disorganization in mural cell environment labeled
with Desmin, Calponin, NG2 and alpha-SMA. Moreover, our histological analyses of CM tissue sections
revealed MRC1pos, LYVE1pos and CD68pos macrophage-like cells surrounding the CM vessels of the brain and
skin suggesting a pro-inflammatory environment. The goal of this fellowship proposal and training plan is to
examine how the EC-R183Q interact with both the mural cells and macrophages. I hypothesize that EC-
R183Q triggers the disorganized assembly of mural cells and subsequent macrophage attraction to the
abnormal vessels. The proposed study will test this hypothesis through the following aims: (1) to identify
paracrine interactions between EC-R183Q and mural cells (2) to identify and characterize mural cell and
macrophage interactions with EC-R183Q in vivo. Completing these aims will provide new insights into the
relationship between EC and the surrounding mural cells and macrophages in the CM. This fellowship training
will provide me with technical, communication, and mentoring skills to leverage my next step to independence.
Working with Drs. Joyce Bischoff and Arin Greene (co-sponsor) at Boston Children’s Hospital will provide me
with an excellent training environment from both the basic science and clinical aspect of the proposed work.

individuals have gender-related voice problems, there is no evidence-based treatment for voice
masculinization, a critical factor in gender-affirming medical intervention and personal safety. Most clinicians
and many patients are left to assume that gender-affirming hormone therapy with testosterone (T) is the only
path toward voice change. The current speculation is that T leads to an increase in the size of the vocal folds,
leading to lower fundamental frequency (fo), and thus to voice masculinization. However, this theory has not
been directly assessed, and T is likely to cause additional structural changes to the larynx and vocal tract that
may impact both self- and listener vocal-perception of gender (VPoG). In summary, despite a critical health
need in an at-risk population, there is a lack of evidence supporting this common voice treatment for GD-AFAB
individuals. The goal of this proposal is to evaluate our conceptual model of voice and speech in GD-AFAB
speakers: 1) that T results in anatomical changes in vocal fold length, vocal fold thickness, and vocal tract
length, decreasing voice fo and speech formants, which leads to changes in VPoG; and 2) that individual
characteristics are related to the degree of VPoG changes with T. This observational study will follow GD-
AFAB adults who are being treated with T as part of their normal clinical care to systemically test this model.
In Aim 1, we will longitudinally characterize the effects of T in GD-AFAB individuals, providing unprecedented
understanding of the actual impact of this common treatment at the group level. In addition to anatomical,
physiological, and acoustical measures, perceptions of both self and others will be included to account for
potential misalignment of these perceptions, which are equally important outcome measures of voice
modification [8, 99]. This aim will provide evidence-based expectations about voice masculinization for
individuals considering the use of T. Aims 2 and 3 will examine changes in VPoG at the individual level,
regardless of group-level findings in Aim 1. In Aim 2, we will define the anatomical, physiological, and
acoustical changes associated with changes in VPoG with T. This aim will identify how T modifies
communication, which will allow for objective outcomes and therapeutic targets in future clinical trials. Finally,
in Aim 3, we will determine participant characteristics that are associated with changes in VPoG with T,
providing more precise expectations about individual treatment responses.
Together, these aims will provide a roadmap for future evidence-based treatment: clinicians will be able to
provide guidance about when, how, and in whom communication will be impacted by T.

Communicating in environments containing multiple talkers (restaurants, parties, etc.) is the biggest challenge
faced by listeners with hearing loss. Previous work has shown that this difficulty stems from both monaural and
binaural deficits. Current hearing aids do not fully compensate for these deficits and thus do not offer adequate
improvements in multitalker environments. In some cases they even introduce additional distortions that may be
particularly detrimental in such situations. The goal of the proposed project is to leverage our understanding of
these different issues to explore ways of improving speech perception for hearing-aid wearers in multitalker
environments. Aim 1 will focus on restoring audibility, which is the primary goal of a hearing aid. Since
amplification strategies are mostly optimized for restoring speech audibility in quiet, they may not be optimized
for speech presented in multitalker mixtures. In particular, the speech of interest in multitalker mixtures may only
be available in rather sparse regions of time and frequency (or “glimpses”). The experiments proposed in Aim 1
will compare the ability of different amplification strategies to restore the audibility and intelligibility of glimpsed
speech. This work will demonstrate the impact that even small variations in audibility can have on real-world
speech understanding, and reveal potentially important differences between current amplification strategies. Aim
2 is motivated by the fact that some listeners with hearing loss also demonstrate reduced sensitivity to binaural
cues, which weakens the perception of location and may hinder selective attention. The experiments in this aim
will investigate speech enhancement strategies that are designed to enhance the representation of speech in
noise to improve intelligibility. Because they operate by altering the speech envelope, a secondary benefit may
be to increase the salience of binaural cues carried in the envelope. Enhancement will be applied to speech
stimuli across a range of spatial tasks, to identify conditions under which a binaural benefit is observed. This
work will open up a new avenue for improving the representation of complex acoustic scenes in hearing-aid
wearers. Finally, while appropriate amplification and binaural enhancement have the potential to improve speech
perception in multitalker mixtures, it is vitally important that hearing devices do not offset these benefits by
introducing distortions that have the opposite effect. Aim 3 will focus on one such distortion that has been
identified. While empirical data is limited, there are many indications that hearing aids increase the tendency for
external sounds to be perceived close to or inside the head. This disorienting effect may have particularly serious
consequences in multitalker mixtures, where distinct spatial locations are critical for segregating competing
voices. The experiments proposed in Aim 3 will systematically examine the effect of hearing aids on sound
externalization, clarify the source(s) of this effect, and determine the impact on speech intelligibility. This work
will highlight the critical importance of maintaining natural sound images in hearing aids for optimizing speech
intelligibility in real-world listening situations.

Antiretroviral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an important tool for preventing transmission to virus naïve
individuals and plays an important role in current efforts to end the HIV epidemic. If taken daily current oral PrEP
strategies reliably block HIV transmission. However, the requirement of strict adherence to daily pill uptake, pill
fatigue and other institutional barriers to access leave oral PrEP underutilized. Long-acting injectable PrEP
strategies have the potential to address many of the problems associated with oral PrEP but the realization of
drug formulations and delivery strategies that ensure sustained drug release for at least three months has
remained challenging and motivates the development of entirely new long-acting PrEP strategies. This project
develops a long-acting injectable PrEP strategy based on membrane-wrapped nanoparticles (NPs) that establish
cellular depots for sustained maintenance of inhibitory concentrations of antiretrovirals (ARVs) at primary tissue
sites of HIV-1 transmission in the female genital tract (FGT) and rectum. Selective targeting of CD169-expressing
macrophages and dendritic cells is accomplished through incorporation of the ganglioside GM3 in the NP
membrane. GM3-CD169 binding triggers uptake and sequestration of NPs in non-endolysosomal compartments
that share distinct similarities with virus containing compartments (VCCs) in tissue-associated macrophages and
dendritic cells. These compartments represent protected sites from where NPs can release drugs into the
surrounding tissue for an extended period of time. Membrane-wrapped inverse micelles of block copolymers will
be engineered as a GM3-NP platform for long-acting PrEP. A combination of long-acting tenofovir (TFV) and
emtricitabine (FTC) prodrugs will be used as active compounds to validate the approach. The block copolymer
NPs will contain TFV covalently linked to a polymer shell that encapsulates an aqueous core holding FTC
conjugated to dendrimers. After quantifying drug loading and release in vitro, the GM3-mediated targeting of
CD169+ myeloid cells in the FGT and rectum of a humanized mouse model will be tested. In parallel, the GM3-
NP platform will be optimized to achieve sustained drug release in the target tissues. The hypothesis that the
optimized NPs provide protection from mucosal HIV infection in a humanized mouse model for at least three
months will be tested. The specific aims of this application are:
Aim 1: To develop membrane-wrapped multicomponent NPs for sustained release of TFV/FTC.
Aim 2: To target CD169-expressing myeloid cells in the FGT and SLTs for sustained TFV/FTC release.
Aim 3: To demonstrate long-term protection from mucosal HIV-1 transmission in humanized mice by TFV/FTC
incorporating GM3-NPs.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY AND ABSTRACT
Targeting the Genus Leishmania with Small Molecules
 Leishmaniasis is a neglected disease caused by protozoan parasites from the genus Leishmania sp. It
is transmitted by the sandfly vector and manifests in different clinical forms including skin ulcers, mucosa
destruction, damage to visceral organs such as the liver and spleen, and bone marrow damage. The clinical
outcome is determined primarily by the species of the parasite and the immune system of the host. There are
98 countries affected by leishmaniasis with more than 2 million people currently infected and 350 million people
at risk. The spread of leishmaniasis is of particular concern to US citizens in southern states such as Texas and
Oklahoma, where cases have recently been reported, as well as to US military troops stationed abroad in
geopolitically unstable regions where the disease tends to thrive.
 Chemotherapy options for leishmaniasis are limited. Antimonials have been the first line drug for decades
in most endemic countries, despite antimony’s notorious adverse effects, hospitalization requirements and
increasing cases of antimony-resistant parasites. Amphotericin B, the main alternative treatment, also causes
significant harmful side effects. Liposomal formulations are better tolerated, but are prohibitively expensive for
most affected populations. Miltefosine, an anti-cancer drug, was recently repurposed to treat leishmaniasis and
is the only oral treatment available and approved for use in the US. Miltefosine also has toxicity limitations,
teratogenicity and lack of efficacy against certain Leishmania species. The development of new chemotherapies
to treat the different clinical forms of leishmaniasis is in urgent demand, and is clearly an unmet medical need.
 To address this unmet medical need, Scott Schaus and Lauren Brown from Boston University (BU) will
lead a collaborative project with Jair Lage Siqueira-Neto at the UC San Diego Center for Discovery and
Innovation in Parasitic Diseases (CDIPD), Camila Indiani de Oliveira at FIOCRUZ and Mark Grinstaff at BU to
characterize the activity of antileishmanial small molecules and develop them as systemic and topical
therapeutics. Preliminary work by the team has led to the identification of a chemotype with nanomolar in vitro
efficacy against both visceral- and cutaneous-causative species of the parasite, a suitable pharmacokinetic
profile for in vivo studies, and demonstrated in vivo efficacy in a cutaneous leishmaniasis infection model.
 This grant outlines a proposal to further develop the chemotype and address specific challenges in
antileishmanial drug discovery, including drug target identification, options for dosing and administration, and
most importantly the applicability of the chemotype to treat multiple manifestations of the disease, including those
that are most relevant and endemic to the American continents. Our end goal is to develop at least one pre-
clinical candidate for the treatment of either visceral or cutaneous leishmaniasis.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Project Summary
Susceptibility to diverse immune diseases has been associated with genetic differences that affect
gene expression. Understanding the mechanisms by which these genetic differences lead to disease
has been a central goal of genomic efforts aimed at describing disease mechanisms and identifying
targets for therapeutic treatments. While large-scale studies have identified thousands of genetic
differences associated with immune diseases, in most cases, it is not known which variants are
causal and which are non-causal passenger variants. This is a considerable problem for the many
variants that exists in non-coding regions of the genome for which function is difficult to predict. Thus,
there is a critical need for the high-throughput experimental approaches to characterize the function
and mechanism of the many non-coding variants associated with immune diseases. To tackle this
challenge, we will use two complementary high-throughput approaches to study the impact of genetic
variants on immune gene expression. We will use MPRAs (Massively Parallel Reporter Assays) to
study the impact of genetic variants on gene expression. We will use our recently developed
CASCADE (Comprehensive Assessment of Complex Assembly at DNA Elements) approach, in
conjunction with mass spectrometry-based studies, to profile the impact of genetic variants on TF-
cofactor complex binding. We will use these approaches to characterize (1) the impact of genetic
variants on ~30 immune gene regulatory elements, and (2) ~5000 genetic variants found to be
associated with immune disease or altered gene expression. Combining these approaches will
address both function and biophysical mechanism of genetic variants in a cell- and stimulus-specific
manner. Furthermore, as many regulatory cofactors can be inhibited with drugs, characterizing TF-
cofactor complexes bound at genetic variants provides an opportunity to identify therapeutics to
counteract their effects. Altogether, by integrating complementary, high-throughput approaches that
directly account for effects of cell type and cell stimulation, the proposed studies will identify the
mechanisms by which non-coding variants affect gene expression and immune diseases.
Furthermore, these studies will lay a foundation for translating large-scale genetic studies into
therapeutic approaches to treat for immune diseases.

as well as peripheral nerves, is a factor in a large array of neurological disorders. These include multiple
sclerosis, stroke, age-related neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s, and in non-neurodegenerative age-
related cognitive impairment. To date, myelin breakdown has been assessed indirectly with neurophysiological
assays of conduction, post-mortem myelin staining, or in-vivo diffusion MRI. In the normal aging rhesus monkey,
post-mortem electron microscopy (EM) has confirmed myelin breakdown at the ultrastructural level; however,
EM studies cannot be scaled up to evaluate the entire 100-cc monkey brain or the larger human brain. Myelin
stains suffer from various technical and practical limitations that impede quantification. Other methods, like label-
free spectral confocal reflectance imaging (SCoRe), and coherent anti-Stokes Raman spectroscopy (CARS), are
promising, but like EM, are expensive, slow and difficult to apply to large brain sections. While SCoRe and CARS
microscopy work in reflectance, opening the possibility of in-vivo imaging through a cranial window in the small-
animal brain, a complementary method is needed that is validated, quantitative and high-resolution, to survey
the status of myelin in whole-brain sections of monkey or human brain. Here we propose to optimize and
validate quantitative birefringence microscopy (qBRM) for high-resolution imaging of normal and
abnormal myelin. The qBRM image provides, for every pixel, two quantitative measures: a) the relative phase
retardance, which is linearly proportional to the density of the birefringent medium and the organization of its
anisotropy; and b) the local orientation of the optic axis of the myelin, which corresponds to the direction of the
structural anisotropy. Archived brain tissues from two rhesus monkey models of myelin damage are available for
this project at the Boston University Medical Campus (BUMC). In Aim 1 we will automate the function of our
birefringence microscope with computer-controlled, motorized polarizer components and stage-positioning, to
facilitate fast, automated image acquisition (montaging) of large tissue sections (up to 40x40 mm). We will also
employ massively-parallel computing resources at BU to rapidly render the multi-megapixel quantitative images.
In Aim 2 we will validate our qBRM image measures by comparing them, in the same sections, with myelin
identified by myelin stains, such as FluoroMyelin Red, and with label-free spectral confocal reflectance (SCoRe)
microscopy. In Aim 3, We will demonstrate the untility of qBRM for quantifying myelin by imaging tissue sections
from three monkey models of myelin pathology: a) behaviorally characterized young and old monkeys with
cognitive assessment; b) behaviorally characterized old monkeys with impaired hand movement produced by
motor-cortex injury and treated with mesenchymal stem-cell derived extracellular vesicles (EVs); c) behaviorally
characterized old monkeys with demonstrated cognitive impairments treated with EVs. Together this will
establish the validity and utility of qBRM for assessing myelin in the central nervous system in health and disease.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) have well-established risk factors such as physical activity (PA),
depression, and hypertension (HTN). These risk factors disproportionately affect racial minority populations, but the
mechanisms underlying racial health disparities are not well understood. In this, geographic factors could be key, as PA,
depression and HTN are strongly affected by geographic exposures, including green space. However, green space is
typically measured with questionnaires, which have substantial error, or satellite-based indexes that are nonspecific and
provide no information on the type of vegetation (e.g., tree vs. grass), nor whether the vegetation is within view at the street
level. As a result, no study has quantified the contribution of green space to racial disparities in ADRD. And while novel
technologies such as Google Street Views (GSV) imaging are promising data sources for capturing unique measures of
green space, managing, processing, and analyzing high-dimensional data present significant logistical and analytical
challenges, especially when linking these data to existing data from large prospective cohorts. Finally, we need to understand
green space in the context of other potentially correlated geographic exposures, or the urban exposome—the totality of life-
course geographic exposures (the set of green space, air pollutants, noise, built environment, and social environment)—to
estimate which factors drive health. This proposal will address these challenges by using GSV imaging to assess the effect
of green space on PA, depression, and HTN, as well as subsequent ADRD risk within the Multi-Ethnic Study of
Atherosclerosis (MESA)—a 10-year longitudinal study of 6,814 men and women without clinical cardiovascular disease at
baseline from 4 racial/ethnic groups (Non-Hispanic White, African-American, Chinese, and Hispanic). Aim 1 will quantify
the effect of specific aspects of green space (e.g. trees, grass, shrubs, plants) on ADRD and cognitive decline and evaluate
whether these associations differ according to race/ethnicity. Aim 2 will determine the indirect effect of green space on
ADRD that is mediated through PA, depression, and HTN. Aim 3 will quantify exposome associations with ADRD and
cognitive decline using untargeted data-driven approaches in conjunction with dimension reduction techniques and evaluate
whether they differ according to race/ethnicity. This research plan is complemented by a training plan that builds on the
applicant’s background in epidemiology and biostatistics and includes new training in (1) implementing deep learning
algorithms to analyze high-resolution geographic data, (2) cognitive function epidemiology, and (3) developing and refining
data-driven approaches to perform exposome-informed epidemiological studies. These combined plans will successfully
prepare the applicant for an independent research career focused on identifying modifiable geographic determinants of
ADRD in diverse populations using innovative measures of geographic context.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Summary
 More than 90% of all cancer-related deaths are caused by metastasis, the spread of cancer from its origin.
By the time most cancer metastases become clinically visible, the disease has progressed too far to benefit from
early-stage interventions such as surgery or radiation. Thus, new approaches accessing specific diagnostic
biomarkers are highly desired to improve therapeutic outcomes. Microenvironmental signatures such as
extracellular matrix (ECM) alterations, stromal composition, or immune components exhibit critical determinants
of metastatic dissemination broadly across cancers. Herein, the main goal of this proposal is to converge the
disease hall markers and rational design of biomolecular engineering to develop multidisciplinary approaches
towards precision diagnostics of cancer metastasis. As metastases start to invade, they alter the extracellular
matrix through aberrant proteolytic activities that could be leveraged as biomarkers. The applicant set out to
systematically identify proteases expressed in metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) by transcriptomic and
proteomic analysis. To improve the detection sensitivity, it is proposed to integrate the proteolytic activity to
formulate a library of enzyme activated sensors by reengineering the ECM targeting nanobody with
extraordinarily tumor targeting efficacy for maximal on-target signal generation (Aim 1). To optimize the detection
specificity, the multiplexity of these activity-based sensors will be extensively expanded for disease classification
using CRISPR-Cas-based nucleic acid barcode readout. Preliminary investigation into the in vivo DNA barcodes
revealed that they could be detected noninvasively as a urinary reporter, but could also enable portable detection
on paper (Aim 2). Beyond initial diagnosis, disease stratification and treatment monitoring are critical to
establishing a robust therapy. The novel sensors will thus be evaluated for noninvasive tumor monitoring and
imaging in disease recapitulating metastatic CRC models (Aim 3). Successful completion of these three aims
would offer a tumoral activation responsive, genetically encoded tracking (TARGET) platform can 1) unveil new
biology at the metastasis-specific tumor microenvironment, 2) provide a completely noninvasive way to track
tumor metastasis, and 3) offer a pipeline for validating novel therapies, which are currently unachievable by
single modality agents. This project requires innovative integration across several fields. The candidate has
assembled an exceptional team to help her achieve the goals of technology development and career transition,
including her mentor Dr. Sangeeta Bhatia (MIT, medical engineering) and Drs. Tyler Jacks (MIT, tumor genetics),
Dr. Richard Hynes (MIT, extracellular matrix), Dr. Frank Gertler (MIT, cell motility) and Dr. Shawn Chen (NIH,
theranostics) on the mentoring committee. This training period will allow the candidate to gain experience in
tumor microenvironment network, pre-clinical cancer models and analytical chemistry. In the future, the principles
of this modular platform could apply to other disease areas. The research program here aligns well with the
candidate’s long-term goal to develop multi-scale engineered tools in the context of cancer.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Project Summary 
Anxiety disorders are highly prevalent, with diagnoses peaking during adolescence, creating a significant psychological and economic societal burden. Moreover, existing behavioral treatments to attenuate inappropriate fear responding in anxiety disorders have limited or no success for nearly half of the adolescent population. A critical barrier to developing treatments better suited for this group is a lack of knowledge about how key neural circuits related to fear acquisition and inhibition mature. The principal goal of this project is to identify the mechanisms underlying fear inhibition specifically as it manifests during adolescence. This project integrates adolescent behavioral models with cutting edge neural imaging and manipulation techniques to elucidate the yet unstudied mechanisms by which safety signals inhibit fear during adolescence. A ‘conditioned safety’ paradigm adapted for application during mouse adolescence is used to address key basic science questions about safety learning with far-reaching translational and clinical value. Through this paradigm, mice learn to utilize stimuli explicitly predicting the absence of an aversive outcome (i.e., ‘safety signals’) in service of attenuating fear responding. Research during the Mentored (K99) phase focused on the connection between the the ventral hippocampus (VH) and prelimbic cortex (PL), regions involved in the allocation and regulation of affective behaviors, and that undergo robust changes across adolescence. In-vivo calcium imaging (fiber photometry) was used to record and optogenetics to manipulate activity in VH-PL neurons in adolescent mice, elucidating a link between real-time dynamics of safety and fear behavior to fluctuations VH-PL signaling. Drawing from the literature and integrating preliminary data collected during the K99 phase led to the advancement of the central hypothesis that VH projections to PL interneurons promote safety behavior by producing a net inhibition of PL that is sustained throughout presentations of safety, but not fear signals, and that the heightened plasticity observed within VH and PL during adolescence provides a ‘sensitive window’ for enhanced efficacy of the conditioned inhibition of fear by safety signals. The goal of the Independent (R00) phase is to identify the PL interneuron targets of VH neurons and their relative activity during conditioned safety. Aim 1 will use a spectrally resolved fiber photometry system to record simultaneously from VH projections and select populations of PL interneurons. Aim 2 will use a Fos-activated (TRAP) viral-vector strategy to manipulate functional ensembles of PL interneurons to establish their contributions to the inhibition of fear. A foundation for accomplishing this research has been set through intensive training and discussion with an advisory panel of mentors, consultants, and collaborators with renowned expertise in adolescent development, fear learning, and circuit and cell-type specific neuronal modulation techniques. The candidate is well-positioned for an independent research career investigating behavioral regulation in developmental rodent models relevant to psychiatric illness and identifying circuit-level targets for intervention and treatment.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
Alzheimer’s disease, the most common cause of dementia and the sixth most common cause of death, afflicts
nearly 6 million people in the United States. Alzheimer’s disease is a major economic burden to our society with
an annual cost of more than $250 billion. Cerebrovascular integrity is critical for proper metabolism and perfusion
of the brain. Compliance of large cerebral arteries is critical as these arteries dampen the pulsatile pressure and
protect the microcirculation and blood brain barrier from damage. Cerebrovascular dysfunction can have
detrimental impacts on the brain. Growing evidences suggest that cerebrovascular dysfunction plays a crucial
role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease and can potentially be used as a biomarker for preclinical
Alzheimer’s disease. The overall goal of this project is to unravel the close relationship between cerebrovascular
remodeling and the progression of Alzheimer’s disease.
 Our preliminary study suggested that with pathological progression of Alzheimer’s disease, the human
cerebral artery showed progressive stiffening, structural breakdown, and increases smooth muscle cell atrophy.
We thus hypothesize that the structural and functional changes in large cerebrovasculature is correlated with
neurodegeneration and the accumulation of Amyloid-β, other toxic metabolites, and tau pathology in the brain.
Building upon our multidisciplinary expertise in vascular mechanobiology, precision mass spectrometry,
advanced optical imaging, immunohistochemistry, vascular biology and neuropathology of Alzheimer’s disease,
we will test this hypothesis in three aims: Aim 1) to determine cerebrovascular remodeling (biomechanical,
structural, and compositional changes) in the frontal and temporal lobes in Alzheimer’s disease; Aim 2) to
determine the association between cerebrovascular remodeling and Alzheimer’s disease pathological changes
in the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain; and Aim 3) to examine the association between cerebrovascular
remodeling and antemortem cognitive status and neuropsychological test performance.
We will use no or low atherosclerotic cerebrovascular and brain tissue from 100 age- and sex-matched brain
donors from the NIA-funded BU Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center with 1) no Alzheimer’s disease pathology,
2) low Alzheimer’s disease pathology, and 3) intermediate/high Alzheimer’s disease pathology
. These
brain
donors have completed annual National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center Uniform Data Set evaluations during
life and have available consensus-based cognitive diagnoses. This proposal is designed to leverage existing
resources to make new discoveries. The matched and parallel studies of cerebral vessels and brain tissue will
provide new understandings of the temporal development of cerebrovascular remodeling and AD. Understanding
the role of vascular remodeling in Alzheimer’s disease may lead to the discovery of new treatment options and
directions for interventions to stave off Alzheimer’s disease.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Visual attention, the ability to select relevant information for prioritized processing, is a fundamental mechanism
for parsing a complex visual world. Importantly, attention is dynamic, acting across time to prioritize information
at behaviorally relevant moments, a process known as temporal attention. Although we know that temporal
attention affects visual perception, the neural mechanisms underlying temporal attention have been little
investigated. Specifically, it remains unknown 1) where in the human brain temporal attention influences visual
processing and 2) what cortical networks control the allocation of visual temporal attention. Here I propose to
investigate the sensory and control mechanisms of temporal attention using contemporary methods in human
visual neuroscience. The high spatial resolution of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) makes it an
ideal tool for investigating the roles of specific cortical areas; however, its slow temporal resolution has obscured
its potential value in studies of temporal attention. To circumvent this limitation, in Aim 1 I will use decoding
together with a tailored experimental design to determine where in the visual cortex temporal attention modulates
sensory processing. In Aim 2 I will use individual-observer mapping to identify control networks that guide
temporal attention and further analyze regions of interest to distinguish between possible control mechanisms.
In Aim 3 I will use the data collected in Aims 1 and 2 to test predictions of a recently introduced dynamic
normalization model of temporal attention and, if warranted, update its architecture and parameters to better
predict the neuroimaging data. Together these experiments and modeling will advance our understanding of the
neural mechanisms of temporal attention as well as our computational theories of dynamic attention.
Understanding these basic mechanisms is relevant for clinical populations with impairments in visual temporal
attention, including individuals with ADHD, neglect, and cerebellar degeneration.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Bacterial glycoconjugates are a diverse group of macromolecules that play a key role in bacterial survival and
pathogenicity by mediating bacteria-host interactions. Despite their structural diversity, many glycoconjugates
are made by prokaryotes utilizing a common mechanism, which includes transferring glycans to a Pren-PP-
linked carrier at the membrane interface. The striking diversity of glycoconjugates is achieved through sequential
addition of glycans by glycosyltransferases (GTs), which transfer sugars from soluble nucleotide-activated
donors (NDP-sugars) to the lipid-based carrier molecule. Despite being ubiquitous across all kingdoms of life,
GTs still represent an excellent target for antibiotics, due to the remarkable degree of selectivity they exhibit for
structurally very similar sugars. Understanding the structural features that influence GT substrate selectivity and
protein-protein interactions in pathogenic bacteria like Campylobacter species is critical for antibiotic
development, and this research proposal strives to address that knowledge gap. To date, the substrates for C.
jejuni GTs have been confirmed in the Campylobacter genus, but structural information for PglA, PglJ, PglH1,
and PglH2 of C. concisus, another clinically significant human pathogen, is still unavailable. Additionally,
characterizing GTs from the same organism's glycoconjugate biosynthetic pathway will offer the structural
information needed for future protein-protein interaction studies and will pave the way for analysis to clarify how
these proteins interact to modulate pathway flux. Aim 1 of this proposal will identify preferred GT substrates
using nano-differential scanning fluorimetry (nanoDSF) and determine steady-state kinetic parameters using
luminescence-based GT activity assays. Aim 2 will be to discover the detergent and buffer conditions required
for crystallization of purified GTs, as well as to optimize protein crystals and collect X-ray crystal data to obtain
high-resolution crystal structures. Aim 3 will be to characterize a number of orthologs from a GT-B sequence
similarity network (SSN) in order to gain insight into GT evolution and to pinpoint the primary sequence variables
that account for their various substrate specificities. Interprotein covariance between GT residues will be
investigated via the GREMLIN method in order to identify interactions responsible for the hypothesized formation
of supramolecular complexes between these enzymes. The resulting findings will reveal binding determinants
controlling specificity for glycans prevalent in pathogenic prokaryotes and demonstrate crucial structure-function
links and protein-protein interactions.

Attention and arousal states play critical roles in influencing how we process information, from moment to
moment. While attention is believed to be strongly coupled with arousal states, the interaction between, and
independent properties of, attention and arousal in modulating visual processing remains poorly understood. In
this proposed research, I will employ a combination of novel functional neuroimaging methods and computational
modeling to examine how attention and arousal influence vision. Specifically, I will examine the modulatory role
of attention and arousal on one of the cornerstone properties of vision, contrast sensitivity—the ability to detect
an object from its background. After disentangling the independent and interactive modulatory effects of arousal
and attention on contrast processing, I will build arousal into computational models of attention in order to gain
insight into the potential canonical computations carried out by arousal and attention in influencing vision, which
in turn has the potential to shape a wide-range of downstream processes such as memory, decision-making,
and navigation. By revealing the extent and role to which attention and arousal alters early vision, results from
this proposal could further our understanding of the cortical and subcortical visual function of people with
abnormal arousal levels (e.g., attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, general anxiety disorder), and with potential
applications down the road in guiding the diagnoses and treatment of disorders that involve atypical arousal
levels.

Cell death is a fundamental process in animal development and homeostasis. Misregulation of
cell death is associated with a large number of human diseases. Our research program aims to
understand the diverse mechanisms of cell death, how dead cells are efficiently removed, and
the physiological effects on organisms when these processes go awry. We study these
questions in Drosophila, a model organism with exceptional genetic, genomic and cell biological
tools. Our research program focuses on several major projects. The first project investigates
non-apoptotic cell death which contributes significantly to development and disease, but is
poorly understood. In the Drosophila ovary, germline-derived nurse cells undergo non-apoptotic
programmed cell death as part of normal development. We have found that nurse cell death is
controlled largely non-autonomously by the surrounding somatic follicle cells by phagocytic and
lysosomal proteins. Ongoing work will uncover the subcellular mechanisms controlling nurse cell
destruction. A second major project investigates how dead cells are removed, particularly in
tissues without access to circulating phagocytes such as macrophages. In many mammalian
tissues, dead cells can be cleared by epithelial cells. In a Drosophila model for engulfment by
epithelial cells, starvation induces degeneration of egg chambers, where the germline is
engulfed by the surrounding epithelial follicle cells. This engulfment process happens
synchronously and rapidly at the onset of cell death; however, the genetic requirements for
engulfment by epithelial cells are not well understood. In particular, how such non-professional
phagocytes increase their phagocytic capacity is not known. Our research program is revealing
how epithelial cells transform to a phagocytic state and how they act to promote cell death. A
third project addresses the consequences of defective phagocytosis in the brain which we have
found leads to neurodegeneration and immune activation. Future work will investigate the links
between phagocytosis, immune signaling and neurodegeneration. We will determine the cell-
type-specific responses to defective phagocytosis and susceptibility to neurodegeneration. A
fourth project investigates cross-tissue interactions in response to cell death in the maintenance
of homeostasis. Given the high degree of conservation of cell death mechanisms between
Drosophila and mammals, we expect that pathways that we uncover in the fly will provide
insight into the diversity of cell death mechanisms and consequences of defective cell removal
in humans.

Despite their important role in birth defects and infant mortality, the 3-D and 4-D patterning
processes that employ multiple signals to drive embryonic development and morphogenesis are
not mechanistically understood. The long-term goal is to obtain a complete molecular description
of 4-D pattern formation, using the simple yet relevant sea urchin larval skeleton as a model. The
central objective in this application is to define a model that captures how the ectoderm expresses
different patterning cues in different regions over space and time using systems biology
approaches, to integrate that network with our spatiotemporal patterning cue reception network
in the responsive skeletogenic cells, then use that network model to identify the underlying
general principles for spatiotemporal deployment of and response to patterning instructions. The
main hypothesis is that differential spatiotemporal expression of the set of signals that regulate
skeleton formation is the central driver of embryonic pattern formation and is hard-wired into the
ectodermal gene regulatory networks that regulate skeletal patterning, while the reception of
those cues drives the spatiotemporal diversification of the skeleton-producing PMCs that in turn
mediate morphogenesis. The expected outcomes are (i) a validated single-cell level set of
interconnected spatiotemporal network models that define the presentation and reception of
patterning cues between the relevant tissues and (ii) computational models that capture the
overall network and that will allow rigorous analysis of the networks' functions. The research
proposed in this application is innovative, in the applicant's opinion, because it utilizes novel
analytical approaches and tools developed by the applicant's group, including a novel scRNA-seq
data analysis algorithm, a new tool for automated 3-D mapping of skeletogenic cells from confocal
image stacks, and polychrome skeletal labeling for post-hoc dynamics analysis. The proposed
research is significant because will establish a highly resolved molecular map of a 4-D
developmental process for skeletal patterning that will offer insight into the general principles that
underlie complex pattern formation. Because of the conservation of many of the relevant
patterning cues between sea urchin and human skeletons, this knowledge may ultimately lead to
new approaches for the prevention or treatment of skeletal birth defects and new strategies for
synthetic biomineral production.

 Although fluorescence microscopy has matured into a prevalent imaging method for biomedical researchers,
fluorescence spectroscopy exhibits several fundamental limitations: (1) lack of composition information; (2)
inability of imaging small biomolecules; (3) color barrier of multiplexing imaging; (4) lack of chemical sensitivity.
 To this end, the advent of stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscopy have revolutionized chemical
imaging. Most importantly, recent developments have proven that SRS microscopy can be complimentary to
fluorescence in addressing the above-mentioned limitations: (1) revealing chemical compositions by targeting
their endogenous chemical bonds; (2) employing a set of bioorthogonal vibrational tags (such as C≡C, C≡N,
carbon-deuterium C-D and 13C isotope) to image small biomolecules; (3) presenting an appealing strategy to
surpass the “color barrier” when coupled with super-multiplexed probes; (4) containing information about
structure and dynamics of the target molecule, as well as its interaction with environment.
 Although SRS has the promise to emerge as the next major modality in biophotonics, its utility has been
limited in the following two major aspects. First, the sensitivity of SRS microscopy has reached an impasse.
Currently, the detection limit cannot image many important small analytes and chemical drugs inside cells, which
are below the concentration of 100 micromolar. Second, although SRS is compatible with live cell biology, the
application of SRS inside live cells is significantly under-explored, largely due to that the available probes for
SRS imaging are seriously lagging behind. As such, many advanced applications of chemical imaging have not
been realized.
 We propose to develop the next-generation, ultrasensitive SRS microscopy by integrating innovations from
imaging instrumentation, probe chemistry and data science. We will employ a new laser source to push SRS
microscopy to the nanomolar range for small fundamental chemical bonds. Meanwhile, we will systematically
develop a library of responsive Raman sensors that can enter live cells and monitor important analytes there.
Moreover, we will deploy newly developed machine learning algorithms to further assist live-cell imaging. When
fully optimized, this will bring SRS microscopy to the ultimate sensitivity (comparable to that of fluorescence
microscopy), and fully open the application in live cell biology.

The objective of the proposed research is to 1) understand if activity of various cell types in DLPFC is consistent
with computational models of decision-making, and 2) investigate if there is a functional hierarchy in macaque
monkey dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) during decision-making. Decision-making is our ability to choose
and perform appropriate actions based on sensory cues and context to achieve behavioral goals. DLPFC is a
key decision-making brain region which receives inputs from higher-order sensory areas and sends outputs to
premotor cortices. DLPFC is also implicated in disorders of decision-making such as schizophrenia but currently,
it is unknown how circuit-level disruptions in this disorder result in its perturbed function. Specifically, we do not
understand 1) how different cell types in DLPFC mechanistically enable decision-making and 2) the spatial
organization of function in this area. We address these questions by combining in vivo neurophysiology with
computational modeling in DLPFC of monkeys performing our novel red-green reaction time checkerboard
discrimination tasks. Our first aim tests three emerging hypotheses of the role of cell types during decision-
making: 1) are inhibitory cells choice-selective or -nonselective during decision-making? 2) Do inhibitory neurons
exhibit contra-specific rather than ipsi-specific connectivity? 3) Do either somatostatin- (SST+) or parvalbumin-
positive (PV+) support decision-making through choice-selectivity? In this first aim, we will first build several cell-
type specific computational models of decision-making to establish predictions of neural dynamics during the
task. We will then use laminar multi-contact electrodes to record single neurons from DLPFC of monkeys
performing our novel red-green reaction time checkerboard discrimination task. With these recorded responses,
we will adjudicate between the models. Finally, we will examine each unit’s electrophysiological properties
(waveform shape and firing rate patterns) with our recently developed and validated approach that allows us to
delineate putative cell types (PhysMAP). With these identified populations, we will test predictions made by our
cell type-specific mean-field models of decision-making. In our second aim, we will test three competing theories
this time regarding the nature of functional gradients in DLPFC: 1) the “modular hypothesis” that different areas
are qualitatively distinct in their representations; 2) the “gradient hypothesis” that different areas contain the same
information which differs quantitatively in the “amount”; or 3) the “hierarchical hypothesis” that “upstream” areas
contain all decision variables whereas "downstream” areas only contain action-oriented variables. We will record
from DLPFC across several anatomical axes during two variants of the checkerboard task. We will then use
decoding and population analysis approaches like demixed principal component analysis to understand the task
representations of DLPFC at each location. Impact: This project will elucidate the in vivo spatio-temporal and
microcircuit dynamics in a clinically relevant brain area. Such data is a prerequisite for future development of
circuit-level therapeutics for mental illness and brain machine interfaces for recovery following brain injury.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Reading comprehension is supported by a hierarchy of cognitive-linguistic processes such as
recognizing words, mapping semantics onto words and phrases, and integrating information across units. In
bilingual individuals, successful reading comprehension must also include some mechanism of language
selection to enable reading in the target language given that both languages are active during linguistic
processing. Due to stroke, bilinguals with aphasia (BWA) routinely demonstrate impairments in reading
comprehension and language selection—in addition to other cognitive-linguistic deficits—which may severely
compromise their ability to access and select appropriate lexical representations in one or both languages
while reading. Previous studies in healthy bilinguals have used eye-tracking-while-reading to determine the
effect of contextual information on real-time sentence comprehension; however, it is currently unknown
whether BWA are sensitive to the same types of information or whether they demonstrate similar patterns of
language co-activation post-stroke.
 The overall goal of this proposal is to address this gap in the literature through a series of eye-tracking-
while-reading experiments to measure the effects of semantic and lexical variables on real-time sentence
processing in BWA. Eye-tracking-while-reading designs are ideal for examining real-time reading because they
permit subjects to i) view all words in a sentence throughout the trial (i.e., without pressing a button to uncover
them) and ii) return to earlier words or phrases for rereading which is especially important for BWA who will
require more time to retrieve lexical representations and process the meaning of a sentence. In the current
proposal, Aim 1 will examine the effects of reading cognates, which share overlapping orthographic and
semantic representations (e.g., piano in English and Spanish), and semantically constrained sentences on
real-time sentence processing. Aim 2 will examine the effects of reading interlingual homograph words, which
overlap in orthography but diverge in meaning (e.g., fin, animal part in English, end in Spanish), and
semantically constrained sentences on real-time sentence processing. Aim 3 will examine the relationship
between eye tracking outcomes and offline measures of language proficiency, linguistic impairment, and
nonlinguistic cognition to investigate the effects of individual variability in BWA reading behaviors post-stroke.
 By achieving these aims, this project will advance our understanding of reading comprehension
impairment in BWA. Ultimately, such findings can be used to enhance clinical outcomes for this population and
will represent an important first step in improving quality of life and access to literacy post-stroke.

The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is one of the most important model organisms for biomedical
research, because of its biological tractability and because much of its physiology and behavior relies
on signaling pathways that are conserved in humans. The goal of this project is to complement the
highly developed genomics and genetics of C. elegans with a comprehensive structural and functional
characterization of its metabolome. In recent work we have shown that C. elegans utilizes small-
molecule architectures of unanticipated diversity and complexity in endocrine and exocrine signaling
that control almost every aspect of its life history, including development, aging, stress resistance, and
a wide range of behaviors. One major focus of our investigations is the elucidation of the biosynthesis
and perception mechanisms of newly identified small molecule signals, which will reveal how
metabolism and conserved signaling pathways interact to control phenotypes. Of particular interest
are (i) the roles of recently identified endogenous agonists of the nuclear receptor NHR-49, a key
regulator of lipid metabolism and functional ortholog of vertebrate PPARα, (ii) male germline-
dependent metabolites that accelerate development and aging via conserved pathways, including
homologs of mammalian steroid receptors, and (iii) our recent discovery of a modular glucosides that
appear to function as a “second layer” of neurotransmitter signaling. In addition, we will investigate the
biological functions of a new family of nucleoside derivatives we discovered that may interact with
purinergic signaling. Another focus area will be the influence of dietary bacteria on C. elegans small
molecule signaling, motivated by our discovery of unexpected roles for bacterial metabolites, e.g. in
modulating fat metabolism via NHR-49 or in serotonin signaling. Central to the proposed research is
the use of synthetic samples and derivatives of identified signaling molecules for bioassays, mutant
screens, and transcriptomic studies, as well as the in-house developed metabolomics platform
(Metaboseek), which greatly accelerates compound identification and functional annotation.
Successful conclusion of this project will provide a structural and functional annotation small molecule
signaling networks in C. elegans, substantially increasing our understanding of conserved pathways
that control development, aging and metabolism, as well as corresponding disease-relevant pathways
in mammals. The small-molecule knowledge generated will not only enable future efforts aimed at
more varied chemical genetic screens exploring additional aspects of the biology and ecology of C.
elegans, but also of nematode species relevant in agriculture or medicine. Furthermore, methodology
developed for characterizing C. elegans signaling molecules will facilitate similar studies toward
structural and functional characterization of small molecule metabolites from other model organisms.

 Despite much progress in mapping genetic associations for T2D, its complications, and related traits,
the underlying causal variants, effector genes, and gene networks are not well understood. The AMP-T2D
consortium aims to accelerate the pace by which these disease mechanisms are elucidated, through
generation and integration of novel genomic data interrogating genetic associations. This project addresses
RFA-DK-19-505 “Limited Competition for the Accelerating Medicines Partnership (AMP) in Type 2 Diabetes
Knowledge Portal (UM1)” and will be conducted by the leaders of the current AMP T2D Knowledge Portal
(T2DKP). Its goal is to continue development of the T2DKP by enhancing its infrastructure to aggregate,
analyze, and visualize genetic and genomic datasets and results, thereby helping to identify causal risk
variants and effector genes for T2D and its complications.
 The goal of specific aim 1 is to enhance the data and knowledge base for the T2DKP. It will enhance
the T2DKP software platform to represent additional classes of ‘omic and phenotypic data, integrate datasets
relevant to AMP-T2D within a federated data warehouse, develop new methods and analytical pipelines to
analyze these data, and enable them to be accessed by download or application programming interfaces
(APIs). The goal of specific aim 2 is to enhance the publicly accessible T2DKP web interface. It will develop
new web modules to visualize datasets within the T2DKP, extend the T2DKP with tools from external public
genomic databases, maintain curated knowledge lists for T2D and its complications, allow users to customize
data and tools shown within the T2DKP, and update the T2DKP in response to stakeholder feedback. The goal
of specific aim 3 is to coordinate the AMP-T2D consortium. It will provide operational support for AMP-T2D
investigators, foster collaborations with external partners, track and ensure the timely release of AMP-T2D
datasets, administer an opportunity pool to fund additional AMP-T2D projects, and conduct outreach and
training on the T2DKP.
 Significance: The project would extend the T2DKP with new capabilities to integrate and display
datasets with information regarding causal variants, effector transcripts, and gene networks for T2D and its
complications. Public access to these data and results will significantly accelerate efforts to identify new
therapeutic strategies to prevent, treat, or reverse T2D and its complications.

In this proposal we aim to identify gene regulatory elements that permit the targeting and manipulation of brain
circuit models of human brain function. Gaining genetic access to specific neuron populations in nontransgenic
animals and humans would enable targeted circuit modulation for hypothesis testing and provide a means to
evaluate the safety and efficacy of circuit modulation for the treatment of epilepsy and psychiatric disorders. Our
approach capitalizes on our combined expertise in the development and maturation of brain cell-types and
circuits (Gord Fishell), identification of CIS-regulatory elements that function across species (Jordane
Dimidschstein) and AAV engineering combined with large-scale screening methods (Ben Deverman). Our efforts
will benefit from an ongoing collaboration with John Reynolds at the Salk Institute on observation and
manipulation of cortical circuits during complex visual perception tasks. This project will build upon success that
we and others have had in identifying gene regulatory elements that enable cell type-restricted gene expression
when used within recombinant adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors. Identifying additional enhancer sequences
that function in the context of the limited carrying capacity of AAV has been slow due to the limited success rate
and low throughput nature of these efforts. Here we aim to apply a novel high-throughput screening approach
for the rapid identification of a suite of enhancers that enable the study and manipulation of genetically defined
cell types and circuits across species. Our preliminary data demonstrates that our enhancer identification
strategy can yield novel and highly specific enhancers that restrict expression to target populations. In addition,
we have demonstrated that it is possible to use the engineered AAV-PHP.eB capsid to screen enhancers across
the brain with a single noninvasive injection. These successes have highlighted the need for more rapid and
comprehensive assessment of putative enhancers. In the UH3 portion of this proposal we will examine the
tolerance to neuronal activity manipulation within the target neuronal populations in several species. We will also
apply the AAV-enhancer viruses for querying disease-related circuits using Rabies tracing in conjunction with
optogenetics. This proposal will be transformative in devising methods to target and manipulate the brain activity
of specific neuronal cell populations across species, including human cell-derived organoids.

The Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD) is a ubiquitous resource for basic research and clinical
interpretation. The world’s largest genetic variation resource, the gnomAD dataset is used in virtually all clinical
genetic diagnostic pipelines worldwide, and the website has over 20 million page views to date. Here we
outline a proposal that will expand the gnomAD resource to millions of samples across diverse global
populations. Our proposal will scale variant-calling and quality control to match this sample size, integrate
statistical tools and other genomic resources critical to clinical interpretation, and ensure that the data we
aggregate will continue to be shared freely with the biomedical community. To accomplish this we will apply a
highly computationally efficient strategy to call all classes of variation (including SNVs, small indels, and the
mutational spectrum of structural variants) across millions of sequenced samples enriched for under-
represented ancestry groups. We will deploy a cloud-based framework for the efficient storage and automated
quality control of these very large and heterogeneous sequence data sets using the massively parallel Hail
architecture. We will leverage the scale of gnomAD to provide increasingly high-resolution maps of the
depletion of functional variation across regions of the genome (highlighting genome regions where natural
selection constrains DNA change) and provide statistical frameworks for quantitatively assessing whether the
population frequency of a variant is consistent with pathogenicity, linking this information with evidence from
the ClinVar resource. We will continue to share all of this data as rapidly and openly as possible with the
biomedical community, long before publication. We will support and expand functionality in our widely
accessed data browser as well as create scalable and publicly accessible datasets that integrate our variation
data with clinical and functional genomic annotations, accessible through API frameworks to empower novel
applications of the datasets. We will also provide resources and training to improve the use of gnomAD
resources by the clinical genetics and wider biomedical communities.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
 The decreasing cost of genomic sequencing will yield millions of samples in the coming years from both
research and healthcare. Sharing this data is necessary to understand human diseases and eventually help
patients, but doing so requires the community to agree on common methods for collecting, storing, transferring,
accessing, and analyzing data. This proposal will support the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health
(GA4GH; www.ga4gh.org) to aid genomic research and human health by developing standards and policies for
effective and responsible data sharing between institutions and countries around the world.
 To advance responsible sharing of global genomic and health-related data, genomics researchers,
clinicians, bioinformaticians, software engineers, and industry experts will work together as a single GA4GH
community to deliver genomic data sharing standards and frameworks (e.g., ontologies, guidelines, technical
schemas). Building on our five years of experience convening stakeholders and developing work products, we
will engage the genomics and health community in the very earliest stages of development to ensure our work
is useful and ready for adoption.
 We will leverage the combined effort of several hundred active contributors to advance development
activities beyond the capacity of our small staff team. These contributors will work within eight GA4GH Work
Streams, each focused on developing critical standards and frameworks, including cloud-based data
federation, scalable schemas and interfaces, data models, and file formats. We will engage deeply within the
broader healthcare, research, and commercial sectors, including the launch of the Genomics in Health
Implementation Forum to drive uptake in the clinical domain.
 A federated ecosystem for searching, discovering, exchanging, and analyzing genomic and clinical data
will enable a global learning health system that advances both research and clinical care beyond their
individual capacities and depends on standards and interoperable frameworks embraced by the entire
community. We envision a future in which the full suite of GA4GH standards enables all clinicians, geneticists,
and researchers to search across the world’s collective genomic data to reveal unanticipated gene-disease
associations, make otherwise impossible drug-response predictions, and generally participate in genomics at a
competitive pace—regardless of their means or location. The promise of genomic medicine lies at a
crossroads that depends on harmonization across the community and will significantly enhance the human
experience if we succeed. We believe that GA4GH is necessary to that success.

Many steps in drug discovery, as well as in basic biological research, could be accelerated with methods that
measure multiple phenotypes simultaneously, known as profiling technologies. When a cell or organism’s
function is affected by disease, a chemical compound, or a genetic perturbation, simultaneously measuring
many phenotypes provides greater power and less bias in identifying their impact. But many existing assays
require many painstaking months to develop and measure only one specific phenotype, missing potentially
crucial information - for example, a chemical might have positive effects on a disease-related assay but its
effects on other pathways are unmeasured, leading to undetected toxicity that is only discovered later.
Research in this MIRA period will focus on advancing algorithms and applications for image-based profiling, a
surprisingly quantitative type of profiling that is the least expensive and among the highest in information
content. Image-based profiling captures the location and amount of each stained cellular component, as well as
changes in morphology, but its applications are underexplored and its algorithms underdeveloped. Having
invented the main assay and software in the field, we aim to bring the technique to maturity now that four
things have become available or possible: (a) Image Data - huge quantities of suitable systematic, structured,
high-throughput, single-cell image data, usually from the Cell Painting assay, via several public-private
partnerships and totaling more than 3 billion single cells across more than 100,000 genetic and chemical
perturbations; (b) Algorithms - novel deep learning algorithms for several steps in profiling: segmentation,
feature extraction, and learning predictive models; (c) Integration - other data sources now available at a
scale that can be fruitfully combined with images; (d) Applications - out of more than a dozen theoretical
applications, many have not been attempted or scaled up for basic biological research and drug discovery, such
as determining compounds’ mechanism of action, identifying their targets, discovering relationships with
genes, predicting toxicity or other assay activity, and identifying gene function.
To fulfill the promise and real-world efficacy of image-based profiling, we therefore aim to leverage recently
available data and algorithms to carry out diverse biological applications, including identifying gene- and
compound-associated phenotypes and functions, virtual screening to identify potential compounds that target
genes of interest, hypothesizing the mechanism of action/targets for small molecules, computationally
predicting assay activity and toxicity, and identifying screenable disease-associated phenotypes. In doing so, we
aim to make rapid progress in algorithms, including trained neural networks/deep learning models, multi-
modal integration, visualization/interpretation, batch correction, and single-cell methods.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
Prion disease is a uniquely rapid, universally fatal progressive neurodegenerative disease of humans and other
mammals. It arises from a single protein, the native prion protein (PrP), which is capable of post-translationally
misfolding into a self-templating and deadly “prion.” Genetic and pharmacological proofs of concept
increasingly identify PrP dosage as the key to understanding, and ultimately intercepting this pathogenic
cascade. In mice with genetically altered PrP levels, lower PrP levels lead to longer survival following prion
infection, while excess PrP hastens disease. PrP-lowering antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) now show
promise as a potential therapeutic strategy. However, effective implementation will hinge on a deeper
understanding of how PrP level controls the rates of prion nucleation, replication and neurotoxicity, and how
this control translates across disease timepoints, species and strains. Though almost all human prion disease
originates in the brain, PrP-lowering interventions have not yet been tested in spontaneous, rather than
inoculated, prion models. Meanwhile, the magnitude of protection conveyed by 50% genetic PrP reduction can
vary between model systems; the relative contributions of slowed prion replication and slowed neurotoxicity to
observed survival benefit in different species and prion strains remain to be disentangled. Finally, PrP lowering
must be studied in the context of patient-derived human prions, to assess how above learnings extrapolate to
strains of public health interest. We will fill these gaps by assessing the following. 1) Kinetics of spontaneous
prion formation. Using a new mouse model of spontaneous prion disease, we will track the spontaneously
disease process through serial molecular measurements of neuronal damage and prion seeding activity.
Through PrP-lowering tool compounds administered at different timepoints, we will disentangle how PrP
dosage modulates prion formation, amplification, neurotoxicity and symptomatic progression. 2) Rapid and
slow prion subtypes as a function of PrP dosage. Using newly engineered PrP knockout hamster and rat
models, we will characterize the kinetics of pathological biomarker rise relative to disease onset and terminal
illness as a function of PrP expression level in both canonically rapid (hamster) and more slowly progressive
(rat) prion disease systems. 3) Impact of PrP lowering on human prions. Using a series of novel
“humanized” mouse lines expressing human PrP at six different dosage levels, that have been shown
susceptible to multiple clinically relevant human prion strains, we will characterize time to pathology, symptom
onset, and terminal illness. PrP level will be varied on a lifelong basis through genetically manipulation, as well
as through postnatal, precisely timed intervention with PrP-lowering tool compounds. Taken together, these
studies will illuminate PrP’s control of disease kinetics across a spectrum of prion disease paradigms, while
building a scientific foundation to guide future development of PrP-lowering therapeutics.

The past decade has seen outstanding advances in the genetics of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Most of
this progress has occurred by the study of rare genetic variation, especially de novo variation, with the Autism
Sequencing Consortium (ASC) playing a central role. The ASC represents a coordinated international effort to
identify ASD risk genes. In our most recent, unpublished, analyses of 72,410 individuals from ASD families, we
identified 185 genes associated with risk (FDR < 0.05). Some of these genes have been linked to a broad array
of developmental disorders, while others have not. Based on these results, we posit that some risk genes alter
the core features of ASD, while creating fewer perturbations to other features of development: discovery of such
genes will provide deeper insights into pathways disrupted in ASD. We will build on this progress by analysis of
sequence data from three resources: ASD subjects and families; subjects with other developmental and neuro-
psychiatric disorders; and subjects from population samples. We plan new research focusing on interpretation
of rare variation, including single nucleotide variation (SNV), indels, and copy number variation (CNV). Our key
targets are inherited variants, including X-linked inherited variants, which to date have shown very little signal,
and missense variants, for which signal has been confined to highly conserved substitutions. We anticipate
doubling the number of ASD genes discovered, ~ 400, by increasing the number of families analyzed and by
refined methods to interpret inherited and missense variation. And, in parallel, we expect to resolve critical as-
pects of ASD genetic architecture and to unveil key aspects of what makes ASD and its core features – social
deficits and restrictive and repetitive behaviors – different from other neurodevelopmental disorders. To discover
ASD risk genes with a distinct effect on ASD, we have the following specific aims: 1) To amalgamate existing
and emerging whole exome and whole genome sequence data; 2) To develop new analytical methods and
analyze the accumulated sequence data; and, 3) To contrast ASD and other neurodevelopmental disorder risk
genes, examining developmental profiles, cell types implicated, and whether variants in the same gene differ in
how they affect risk for ASD and other neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. With this new research
we will accelerate our overall objective, which is the identification of ASD genes, thereby facilitating our long-
term goal of building the foundation from which therapeutic targets for ASD emerge. Our rationale is that the
identification of genes conferring significant risk to ASD and associated neurodevelopmental disorders can form
the basis of studies to understand pathogenesis, as well as the basis for novel therapies. Our central hypothesis
– formulated based on results over the past decade – is that rare and common variation contributes additively to
risk for ASD, but only certain rare variants confer substantial risk. The research proposed is innovative, in our
opinion, because it uses groundbreaking and novel statistical methods for identifying risk variants for ASD.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Cardiometabolic diseases affect millions of people worldwide and have numerous underlying risk factors. Commensal microbes that comprise the intestinal microbiome are implicated in the progression and onset of many of these diseases, including type 2 diabetes, obesity, and atherosclerosis. Gut microbes have extensive metabolic capabilities, allowing them to produce or modify molecules that influence disease risk. Members of the gut microbiota have been known to convert cholesterol into the poorly absorbable metabolite coprostanol for almost 100 years, however the microbial genes responsible for this metabolism were not known. In recent work, we analyzed paired gut metagenomic and metabolomic data to identify a novel group of cholesterol dehydrogenases that metabolize cholesterol when expressed in vitro. Using clinical and metagenomic data from the Framingham Heart Study (FHS), we observed lower serum cholesterol in subjects whose microbiomes encode these cholesterol dehydrogenases. The cholesterol dehydrogenases we originally described convert cholesterol to cholestenone and coprostanone to coprostanol, and we have since identified the intermediate enzyme that converts cholestenone to coprostanone. In this proposal, we will functionally characterize metabolism of sterols in the gut and determine the impact of this process on cardiometabolic disease. In Aim 1, we will identify determinants of host-microbe interactions by collecting and analyzing clinical variables with stool and serum samples from the Gen3/Omni2 FHS cohorts. We will generate coupled stool and serum metabolomics and metagenomics datasets, perform culturomics to assemble a microbial strain library, and identify host exposomes from clinical data. We will then utilize these data to identify and prioritize microbially- derived or modified circulating metabolites associated with CVD for further mechanistic investigations. In Aim 2, We will couple bioinformatics with microbiology and biochemistry for targeted identification of enzymes/proteins that alter sterol structures. This effort will allow us to probe the diversity of gut microbial sterol metabolizing enzymes and their substrates in order to determine specific microbes and genes with the capacity to modify cholesterol. Taking a systems-level approach, we will colonize mice with cholesterol-metabolizing microbial communities to determine how microbial metabolism modulates serum cholesterol and pathways central to cardiovascular disease. In Aim 3, we will functionally link microbiome enzyme activity to sterol metabolism and metabolic disease. We will employ cell-based transcriptional and proteomic assays to interrogate the effects of microbially-modified sterols on local sterol sensing pathways in epithelial cells and measure the effects of circulating sterol metabolites on human immune cells.

CRISPR-Cas9 is an RNA-guided endonucleases that is being actively used for sequence-specific DNA
recognition, genome engineering, targeted transcriptional activation/repression and genome imaging. Cas9 is
being developed as a gene therapy agent for multiple pathologies, including HIV, vision disorders, muscular
dystrophy, and hereditary disorders. The precision control of specificity of CRISPR-Cas9 is required as off-
target effects and chromosomal translocations are observed at elevated activity. Further, the ease of targeting
catalytically impaired Cas9 to any genomic locus has resulted in transformative technologies. For example, the
fusion of catalytically inactive Cas9 (dCas9) to transcriptional activators or repressors has enabled gene
transcription and repression; fusion of catalytically impaired Cas9 to base-modifying enzymes has allowed base
conversion (e.g., C→T) at specific genomic sites; dCas9‒GFP fusion has made imaging genomic loci possible;
and dCas9‒acetyltransferases or deacetylases fusion has enabled epigenome editing. We propose to apply
chemical and genetic approaches develop reagents and methods that will allow precision control of specificity
of CRISPR-Cas9.

 The direct manipulation of genes and gene products in vivo has enormous therapeutic potential, and many
strategies to achieve these goals are swiftly advancing toward clinical use. Proteins that can manipulate DNA,
RNA, and proteins in living cells, including genome editing technologies that enable the precise correction of
disease-causing mutations in vivo, have exemplified the promise of such approaches both for research and
therapeutic applications. While many of these approaches have shown promise in initial research studies,
proteins often require extensive development and tailoring to acquire the activity, specificity, and stability needed
to serve as impactful research tools or leads for therapeutic development. As new macromolecular therapeutic
modalities continue to be developed at a remarkable rate, methods to generate proteins on a rapid time scale
with tailor-made functions are needed. Ideally such methods will be versatile and can be applied to many
classes of problems in the life sciences.
 Our lab developed phage-assisted continuous evolution (PACE), a technology to evolve biomolecules ≥100-
fold faster than using conventional laboratory evolution approaches, with minimal required researcher
intervention. We have demonstrated the ability of PACE to evolve many different classes of proteins with new
and altered activities, specificities, and other desirable properties such as soluble expression in E. coli. Proteins
evolved using PACE have shown broad utility in multiple non-bacterial settings, including genome editing agents
that have been applied to rescue human cell and animal models of genetic diseases, and insecticidal proteins
that kill agricultural pests. These developments establish PACE as a broadly applicable and highly enabling
technology for generating therapeutically and biotechnologically relevant proteins.
 We propose to apply PACE to evolve novel proteins with therapeutic potential, or that enable new
technologies for therapeutics discovery. These proteins include next-generation precision genome editing
agents that can be more easily delivered in vivo or are more efficient and clinically relevant; self-delivering
proteases that cleave endogenous protein targets implicated in neurodegenerative disorders and brain cancer;
and small molecule-binding proteins that enable drug-induced target protein degradation. Success would
provide a foundation for innovative therapeutic strategies to correct mutations that cause human genetic
diseases, and to reprogram self-delivering proteases as catalytic drugs to treat brain diseases. In addition, by
creating drug-sensitive alleles that allow a protein of interest to be degraded in a small molecule-dependent
manner, the proposed research would establish powerful new functional genomics tools to reveal biological
functions and validate therapeutics targets. Collectively, the proposed research integrates powerful protein
evolution technologies with enzymes that precisely manipulate genomes and proteomes to advance
therapeutics science.

 The Center for Open Bioimage Analysis will serve the cell biology community’s growing need for
sophisticated software for light microscopy image analysis. Quantitative image analysis has become an
indispensable tool for biologists using microscopy throughout basic biological and biomedical research.
 Quantifying images is now a critical, widespread need as imaging experiments continue to grow in scale,
size, dimensionality, scope, modality, and complexity. Many biologists are missing out on the quantitative
bioimaging revolution due to lack of effective algorithms and/or usable software for their needs, or lack of
access to training. The Center brings together the Carpenter laboratory at the Broad Institute and the Eliceiri
laboratory at the University of Wisconsin­Madison, and in doing so brings together the two most popular open
source bioimage analysis projects, ImageJ (including ImageJ2 and FIJI) and CellProfiler. Through the
collaborative development and dissemination of open source image analysis software, as well as training
events and resources, the Center will empower thousands of researchers to apply advanced analytics in
innovative ways to address new experimental areas.
 Building on the team’s expertise developing algorithms and user­friendly software for use in biology under
real­world conditions, the Center will focus on two Technology Research and Development (TR&D) projects:
deep learning­based image processing, and accessibility of image­processing algorithms for biologists. This
work will not occur in isolation at the Center; rather, the Center will nucleate a larger community working on
these two areas and serve as a catalyst and organizing force to create software and resources shared by all.
 The Driving Biological Projects (DBPs) will serve a major role in driving the TR&D work: our teams are
accustomed to working deeply and iteratively on problems side by side and with frequent feedback from
biologists. This will ensure that important cell biological problems drive the work of the Center. The DBPs
reflect tremendous variety in terms of biological questions, model systems, imaging modalities, and researcher
expertise and will ensure robustness of our tools for the widest possible impact on the community. Continuing
the teams’ track record with ImageJ and CellProfiler, two mature open source bioimage analysis software
projects critical to the work of biologists worldwide, the Center will also assist and train biologists in applying
the latest computational techniques to important biological problems involving images.
 In short, the need for robust, accurate, and readily usable software is more urgent than ever. The Center for
Open Bioimage Analysis will serve as a hub for pioneering new computational strategies for diverse biological
problems, translating them into user­friendly software, further developing ImageJ and CellProfiler, and training
the biological community to apply advanced software to important and diverse problems in cell biology.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：The contemporary clinical successes of immunotherapies have highlighted the key role of tumor-infiltrating cells
in mediating anti-tumor immunity and have generally associated the presence of T cells within tumors with
therapeutic response. However, until now, a systematic approach for evaluating how T cell state, their clonal
identity and localization are related has not been possible. In recent years, the Wu lab has achieved several
notable technical advances, including generation of a best-in-class HLA class I epitope predictor (HLAthena); a
highly robust targeted plate-based method for single-cell TCR sequencing (rhTCRseq); and a means to
parallelize the cloning of hundreds of TCRs such that they can be interrogated to definitively link a TCR with its
antigen specificity. Because dynamic interactions between tumor-reactive T cells and malignant clones occur
within the defined spatial ordering of tissue, our valuable new insights motivate us to investigate how the spatial
organization of tumor-specific T cells relates to in situ positioning of tumor clones. We hypothesize that antigen
specificity, which drives the interactions between T cells and tumor cells, impacts the distinct regional localization
of T cells within the tumor microenvironment at baseline and in the context of therapy; conversely, that knowledge
of spatial localization identifies T cell clones specific for distinct antigen types. Slide-seq technology, created by
the Chen lab, provides a tractable and exciting path to investigate this hypothesis by implementing a scalable
approach to undertake in-depth analyses of informative human and murine tumor tissues. By expanding the
capabilities of this unbiased cellular resolution spatial capture method, we aim to gain tissue level understanding
of how the abundance and functional state of T cell clones and their spatial orientation within the tumor
microenvironment are linked. In particular, the study will address the spatial organization of T cell clones and
tumor subclones in human and mouse tumors. Our technology goals will be to increase the efficiency of
transcript capture of the technology, extend the capability to include robust detection of tumor mutations, and to
develop a suite of analytic tools to integrate in a multi model fashion the transcript, DNA-level and TCR levels of
information (Aims 1-2). Focusing on RCC tumors, we will evaluate the cell-cell localization patterns of T cell
clones in relation to tumor subclones and stromal cells through integrated spatial analyses of TCR and DNA
Slide-seq data (Aim 2). Finally, we will evaluate the impact of antigen specificity (definitively assessed by robust
TCR reconstruction and interrogation methods established in our lab) on T cell phenotype and localization using
TCR and DNA Slide-seq integrated spatial analyses at baseline and following immune checkpoint blockade and
neoantigen vaccine. (Aim 3) Altogether, we will develop and test these tools to understand spatially localized
cellular networks which drive immune response, and T-cell receptor relationships with the tumor
microenvironment. The completion of our work will yield a comprehensive toolset to enable a molecular,
cellular and histological understanding of the tumor immune response.

Cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by b-site APP cleaving enzyme-1 (BACE-1) is the rate-
limiting step in production of Ab, whose deposition is the pathological hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease
(AD). Despite a rapidly growing burden of health care for the aging United States, there is a fundamental
gap in understanding how trafficking and mutations of APP influence neuronal function and contribute to
AD pathogenesis. Continued existence of this gap represents a critical problem because, until it is filled,
AD prevention and treatment based on molecular understanding of the disease progression remains
inaccessible. Since neurons can grow axons that are up to a meter long, continuous imaging of APP
trafficking and processing in live neurons at the single-molecule level requires extremely photostable
fluorophores. Our lab has recently developed a new class of upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) that
are immensely photostable over months. The overall objective of this project is to use our novel
photostable UCNPs to perform single-molecule imaging of the trafficking and processing of APP in live
human induced neurons (iNs) – an excellent model system as many human diseases are not fully
recapitulated in mouse neurons. The central hypothesis is that mutations of APP lead to impaired axonal
transport and render APP more vulnerable for b-cleavage by BACE-1. This hypothesis has been
formulated on the basis of previous work on culture mouse neurons and transgenic mouse models. The
rationale for the proposed research is that ultralong-term single molecule imaging of WT and mutant APP
in human iNs will reveal axonal transport defects caused by AD-associated mutations, providing
important insights into their relationship to AD. Guided by strong preliminary data on the novel
experimental platform, the hypothesis will be tested by pursuing the three specific aims: 1) Measure the
trafficking dynamics of endocytosed APP in human iNs; 2) Determine how axonal transport is impaired
by mutations of APP in human iNs; and 3) Visualize the association dynamics of APP and BACE-1 in
human iNs. A battery of techniques including single-molecule imaging, nanotechnology, biochemistry
and stem cell technology will be used to interrogate APP trafficking. The approach is innovative because
it departs from the status quo by utilizing extremely photostable UCNPs to perform long-term single-
molecule tracking, novel analysis for non-invasive determination of motor number, and the use of human
induced neurons. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to characterize in depth
the trafficking and association dynamics of APP and BACE-1 with unprecedented spatiotemporal
resolution, as well as uncover the extent to which APP mutations impair axonal transport, thereby
shedding light on future prevention and treatment of AD.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
Copper is an essential co-factor for enzymes across the animal kingdom yet even modest intracellular
concentrations can be toxic, resulting in cell death. The toxicity of copper prompted the development of copper
ionophores such as elesclomol as potential cancer therapeutics. However, lack of clarity regarding their
mechanism of action has prevented their clinical development despite a favorable tolerability profile in clinical
trials. We have recently described that copper ionophores promote a surprising new form of regulated cell death,
distinct from other known and well annotated cell death pathways (such as apoptosis, ferroptosis and
necroptosis). This new form of regulated cell death is copper dependent (hence termed “cuproptosis”) and is
regulated by mitochondrial FDX1 and cellular protein lipoylation, a conserved lysine post-translational
modification regulating only 4 key mitochondrial enzymes. Despite this essential role in enabling cuproptosis,
little is known about the natural function of FDX1 in the cell, and the regulation and manifestation of protein
lipoylation in different cancer types. Establishing a coherent mechanism explaining FDX1 and protein lipoylation
regulation of copper ionophore induced cell death is crucial for any future attempts to repurpose these molecules
as cancer therapeutics. As such, we will combine multidisciplinary approaches that include genomic and
proteomic perturbation strategies with metabolite profiling and multiplexed imaging in cell culture and distinct
mouse tumor models to determine the natural function of the key regulators of cuproptosis (FDX1 and protein
lipoylation) in cancer cell growth and tumor formation, enabling a mechanistic understanding of how they regulate
cuproptosis. Specifically, in Aim 1, we will focus on elucidating the natural function of the key regulator of
cuproptosis, FDX1, in cells. We will take a focused approach to determine if it regulates Fe-S cluster biosynthesis
or protein lipoylation, we will use proteomic approaches to characterize its protein-protein interactions, and we
will perform deep mutational scanning to map the structure-function interactions of FDX1. In Aim 2, we will
specifically focus on the unique regulatory role of lipoylated DLAT in promoting cuproptosis. We will use different
image-based approaches to define the biophysical properties of lip-DLAT aggregates and their protein
composition identifying links to multiple other cellular features. In Aim 3 we will first explore the levels of protein
lipoylation across hundreds of cancer cell lines and establish the cell state associated with high lipoylation cancer
cells. Then, we will determine the manifestation and dependency on FDX1 and protein lipoylation in both classic
xenograft tumor models and in models of metastatic tumors growing in different organs. Lastly, we will use these
in vivo models to establish the efficacy and on-target engagement of copper ionophores in cancer cell models
that are predicted to be highly sensitive to these compounds. Together, this proposal will advance our
understanding of the role of FDX1 and protein lipoylation in cancer and how these key regulators promote
cuproptosis in cells and tumors.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Chemical biology and systems biology operate at different scales of molecular or cellular
organization, requiring translation between the disciplines (e.g., terminology, existing evidence,
new findings) to allow each to inform the other (1, 2). We propose a Biomedical Data Translator
Knowledge Provider for Systems Chemical Biology to address this need.
Centrally, the promise of systems chemical biology (SCB) is discovering novel therapeutics
and re-purposing opportunities, avoiding toxicity and other side effects, and understanding
how small molecules function (i.e., mechanism-of-action studies). Many evidence types used
to solve such problems can also be used to understand functions of alterations at similar
molecular scales, such as post-translational modification and protein-coding genetic variants.
Currently, researchers in the field face major data access and interpretation challenges. For
example, to support mechanism-of-action (MoA) studies, many experimental methods produce
relevant data (gene-expression, protein-protein interactions, diverse bioactivities against pure
proteins and cells, etc.) that are too numerous and heterogeneous to query for most researchers.
Many web-based tools exist to share such data, but they are scattered, not always easy to find,
and generally lack any communication between each other. As the field matures and increasingly
embraces high-throughput experiments, these problems will only get worse (3).
Our proposed SCB Knowledge Provider will mitigate these challenges by:
• integrating and reconciling core molecular data (structure, name, annotated target) from
multiple existing resources;
• integrating and analyzing biological activity data for small molecules across multiple
biological scales (binding, cellular activity, disease indication) (4); and
• providing context for activities of small molecules and their targets informed by systems
biology (complexes, pathways, processes).
Our proposed SCB Knowledge Provider will enable answering questions such as:
• what is the mechanism of action of a small molecule identified from a phenotypic screen?
• which compounds are available to modulate my target of interest, and which other
candidate targets might influence the activity of my target in a particular cellular context?
• given my interest in a disease process or pathway, which candidate targets should I
consider in relevant models, and which compounds are known to modulate those targets?
We anticipate addressing gaps in data by scouting for inclusion additional sources of small-molecule
bioactivity and contextual information about protein target function (see Data
Milestones). We will implement existing and develop new methods to surface inconsistencies
and prioritize returned results (see Methods Milestones). Finally, we propose an Advisory
Committee to help prioritize content most relevant to researchers, overcome development
obstacles, and keep abreast of emerging data and methods (see Outreach Milestones).
We have core expertise needed to realize this SCB vision via 15+ years of experience with
small-molecule bioactivity databases and portals (5-7), plus expertise in phenotypic screening,
small-molecule profiling, and MoA studies (8-10), which demand integrated understanding of
diverse data for hypothesis-driven science. We also made key contributions to Translator
feasibility, including a workflow-centric view of data exploration by subject-matter experts,
identifying and providing key datasets and methods for production of TIDBITS, and prototyping
set-based (e.g., gene-list) analyses in workflows. These experiences ideally position us to
realize a Systems Chemical Biology Knowledge Provider for Translator.

Understanding of genetic interactions can lead to therapeutic design for individual cancer patients by targeting
the specific genetic vulnerability in the cancer genome. For example, by identifying gene pairs that pose severe
fitness defects when knocked out simultaneously (compared to separate knockouts), one can selectively kill
cancer cells that harbor loss-of-function mutation in one protein by inhibiting its synthetic-lethal partner. Despite
generation of large-scale data delineating the tumor transcriptome, proteome, metabolome, imaging, and so on,
little is known regarding how different genes interact with each other and it is unclear how one can design
targeted treatments based on the ‘omics data available. To address these challenges, the proposed research
will develop a “visible” machine learning framework to systematically understand the higher-order genetic
interactions (i.e. di-genic and tri-genic interactions) in cancer and design targeted treatments.
 The first step for the proposed framework is to gain a holistic view of cancer pathways through combining
the ‘omics data available. Multiple approaches have been applied to integrate data of similar forms, but there yet
lacks an effective solution for integrating data of vastly different qualities and formats. To address this challenge,
Yue Qin has developed a method to infer a hierarchical cancer cell map capturing cancer pathways at multi-
scale resolution by fusing immunofluorescence (IF) imaging data and affinity purification-mass spectrometry (AP-
MS).
 During the F99 phase of the proposed research, by tying the architecture of a deep neural network to the
hierarchical cancer cell map, Yue will develop a “visible” neural network (VNN) that can predict the cancer cell
fitness from genetic perturbation (i.e. knockouts) and genomic backgrounds (i.e. mutations) while providing
mechanistic insights in cancer pathways critical for genotype-phenotype prediction.
 During the K00 phase of the award, Yue will develop genetic engineering approaches to experimentally
map higher-order genetic interactions in cancer cells based on the mechanistic insights obtained from VNN
during genotype-phenotype prediction. The data generated experimentally can directly inspire targeted treatment
designs. In addition, the new data can be integrated into the hierarchical cancer cell map to improve accuracy
and resolution of the inferred pathways, thus further improving the “visibility” of VNN in genotype-phenotype
prediction.
The combination of a computational focused training during F99 phase and experimental focused training
during K00 phase will fully prepare Yue leading her own interdisciplinary research in cancer biology. In addition,
the personalized training plan covering aspects including mentoring and teaching, scientific writing, and oral
presentation will ensure Yue acquiring skills necessary for her future establishment as an independent
investigator.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
This proposal outlines a five-year research and career development program aimed at building computational
frameworks for understanding the phenotypic effects of perturbations and somatic alterations in cancer. The
application is heavily based on the candidate’s extensive PhD training in Carnegie Mellon University’s world-
renowned Computer Science Department. It is also grounded in the candidate’s rich prior experience working
as an Associate Computational Biologist at the Broad Institute, and his large network of top-level physicians
and scientists in the cancer field. It also leverages his current postdoctoral appointment under Dr. Gad Getz at
the Broad Institute, and the unique set of resources, facilities, collaborations and expertise in this institute.
Along with a series of relevant didactics and career building activities, these studies will form the basis of his
transition to an independent tenure track position as a scientist guided by the goal of enabling long-term
modeling and understanding of cancer as a disease. The large-scale availability of next-generation sequencing
data for cancer has offered an unprecedented characterization of somatic changes that happen in this disease.
Understanding their combinatorial phenotypic effects is still an open problem, and powerful in vitro perturbation
protocols have been designed to experimentally probe these effects. However, the search space for possible
combinations of perturbations to screen is prohibitively large. The objective of this work is to provide principled
Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven methodology for inferring the effects of perturbations and observed somatic
alterations in cancer, a crucial step in understanding the mechanisms. The proposed work draws on recent
development in the technical fields of machine learning and causal discovery. In particular, two Specific Aims
will be evaluated: (Aim 1) inferring causal graphs from single-cell RNA-seq (with the option of pairing it with
whole-exome/whole-genome sequencing); (Aim 2) using a deep generative model, along with paired whole-
exome/whole-genome sequencing, to learn latent underlying factors of variation in single-cell RNA-seq. The
proposed work also includes steps to validate these computational aims. When completed, this work will
advance the field via algorithms/resources that can be used to: (1) use causal knowledge to computationally
select combinations of targets to test in the lab; and (2) computationally infer the effects of somatic DNA
alterations of interest on expression, leading to improved downstream experiment design. Therefore, put
together, the proposed aims are a crucial step in understanding mechanisms in cancer, and will lead to
significant progress towards efficiently discovering drugs for this disease.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：A major goal of the Biomedical Data Translator Program is to facilitate disease classification
based on molecular and cellular abnormalities. While many experimental approaches exist to
interrogate molecular or cellular processes, few can discern which among a host of potential
abnormalities are relevant to disease in the human system. Genetic variants associated with
disease are unique in providing molecular alterations causally related to human disease risk.
There are two types of genetic associations. Rare disease associations can (usually) be
clearly linked to a gene and are well represented by catalogs such as ClinVar, OMIM, and
Monarch. Complex disease associations are harder to interpret because they (a) are statistical
rather than qualitative and (b) usually lie in noncoding genomic regions that cannot be
immediately translated to molecular or cellular abnormalities. Many complementary resources to
help in the biological translation of complex disease associations have recently emerged,
broadly classifiable as either “functional genomic” datasets (e.g. from epigenomic profiling or
chromatin capture) or predictive bioinformatic methods (e.g. that integrate various genetic and
functional genomic datasets to predict disease-susceptibility genes or pathways). These
resources require expertise to curate and interpret, and there is as yet no knowledge source
that integrates them to interpret complex disease associations. Furthermore, techniques for
harmonizing heterogeneous functional genomic datasets with respect to one another are not yet
established, most predictive bioinformatic methods specify complex data-processing pipelines
that have not yet been scaled to run across many diseases, and there are few if any “gold
standards” to evaluate the molecular or cellular abnormalities identified by these resources.
The goal of our proposed project is to address these gaps within a complex
disease genetics Knowledge Provider for Translator. We are experts in complex disease
genetics and maintain the Knowledge Portal Network (KPN), a collection of open source web
portals and Smart APIs that make integrated genetic and genomic datasets publicly accessible
for >180 complex diseases. We have built the KPN by developing a protocol for working with
disease experts to aggregate and curate high-confidence genetic datasets, building
computational pipelines to harmonize these data and apply predictive bioinformatic methods
upon them, and extracting relationships mined from these data into a Neo4J graph database.
We propose to use the KPN as a foundation to implement a Translator Knowledge Provider of
high-confidence complex disease associations and predicted disease-relevant molecular and
cellular abnormalities. We will implement this Knowledge Provider by (a) expanding the data
sources, data types, and bioinformatic methods integrated within the KPN; (b) developing new
computational algorithms to improve the ability of genetic data to identify molecular and cellular
abnormalities underlying complex disease; (c) maintaining REST services provisioning
Translator with these resources; and (d) developing methodologies for evaluating the accuracy
and internal consistency of these data, further curating them, and defining use cases of them
within Translator. In so doing, we will enable Translator users to address questions such as:
• What genes are causally linked to complex disease [X], and with what confidence?
• What is the increase in risk for complex disease [X] when gene [Y] is perturbed?
• What pathways are enriched for associations with complex disease [X]?
• What tissues mediate the pathogenesis of complex disease [X]?
• What other diseases are genetically correlated with complex disease [X]?
We participated in the Translator feasibility study and contributed important insights to the
project vision including (a) a unifying architectural model of Translator (based on interviews with
each Translator team) closely followed by OTA-19-009; (b) the concept of Translator as a tool to
augment (rather than replace) human reasoning; and (c) the idea of a “Turing test” to evaluate
Translator capabilities. Our expertise in human genetics and hypothesis-driven science, but also
computer science and computational biology, ideally positions us to collaborate with NIH staff
and other awardees to help guide Translator data integration in a scientifically rigorous manner.

Research Plan: Targeted protein degradation using molecular glues - small molecules that bring a protein of
interest in proximity to an E3 ligase - emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy for cancer, especially for
proteins that have been historically challenging to target with conventional drug discovery approaches. However,
the development of molecular glue degraders presents a formidable challenge due to the absence of a
systematic methodology for identifying these compounds. Currently, most molecular glue degraders employed
in the clinic setting have been identified through serendipitous discovery, thereby limiting their potential
applications for targeting intractable oncogenic proteins. To address this challenge, I have developed a novel
chemoproteomic approach, referred to as "Lysate IP", which enables the identification of novel molecular glue
activities in small molecules.
In my preliminary investigation using this method, I discovered that lenalidomide, an FDA-approved molecular
glue degrader, induces ASS1 recruitment to CRBN, but it does not result in ASS1 degradation. Given the
extensive use of lenalidomide in the clinic and in CRBN-based PROTACs, it is crucial to examine all potential
activities that lenalidomide elicits. Therefore, during the mentored K99 phase, I propose to investigate the
implication of ASS1 recruitment to CRBN by lenalidomide, and its role in lenalidomide resistance in multiple
myeloma (Aim 1). In the subsequent independent R00 phase, I intend to utilize the developed Lysate IP assay
for the large-scale, multiplexed identification of novel molecular glues against unexplored E3 ubiquitin ligases
(Aim 2), as part of the anticancer drug discovery process. The primary objective of this research is to
systematically identify and characterize new molecular glues with the ultimate goal of expanding the small
molecule toolbox for targeted cancer therapy.
Career Development Plan: I have created a 5-year career development plan that enables me to attain my goal
of becoming an independent investigator in cancer biology. My extensive background in chemical biology and
medicinal chemistry has positioned me in a unique position to accomplish the goals outlined in this proposal.
Supported by an interdisciplinary team of advisors and collaborators, including Drs. Benjamin Ebert, Eric Fischer,
Scott Armstrong, and Amit Choudhary, I aim to acquire novel proficiencies in a range of areas including large-
scale chemical screenings, mass spectrometry, omics-scale data analysis and visualization, and comprehensive
cancer biology. Additionally, with institutional support from the Broad Institute, as well as through formal
coursework and training, I will establish an independent, cancer-oriented drug discovery program with the goal
of expanding the range of druggable proteins using small molecules.

 This is a request to consolidate three ongoing NINDS-funded proposals that deal
with neuromodulation (R37 NS 17813), temperature compensation (R01 NS 81012), and
computational models of homeostatic regulation of intrinsic excitability (Project #4 of
P01 NS07949). Together these projects comprise a coherent attempt to understand
brain circuit stability in the face of: a) extensive neuromodulation, b) constant and rapid
turnover of ion channels and receptors, and c) degenerate and multiple solutions at the
single neuron and circuit level. These questions arise from years of computational and
experimental work using the small circuits of the crustacean stomatogastric ganglion
(STG), but address general problems relevant to all nervous systems, from invertebrates
to humans. Future experiments will combine experimental and computational work to
understand the correlations in biological parameters in neurons and networks that allow
any given parameter to be variable while the circuit itself retains robustness. Animal to
animal variability in response to perturbations will be measured, the strengths of all of
the synapses in STG circuits will be measured, and the regulation of multiple
neuromodulator receptors by single neurons will be studied. Additionally, self-tuning
models will be developed to find sets of neuronal parameters that allow neurons to
maintain stability in response to perturbations. This work will illuminate the extent to
which the same animal can potentially generate similar behavior by substantially
different (degenerate) circuit mechanisms at different times. If so, this can shed light on
how larger circuits may switch between a number of degenerate circuit mechanisms to
generate stable behaviors over time.

The overall goal of the NIGMS-funded research in my lab is to define the molecular and cellular mechanisms
underlying dynamic rearrangements of the actin cytoskeleton, and to explore how these mechanisms are
harnessed in vivo (in yeast and animal cells) to control diverse actin-based processes such as cell motility,
endocytosis, intracellular transport, and cell morphogenesis. Genetic and biochemical research has been
rapidly producing a ‘molecular parts list’ for the actin cytoskeleton, and many of the components have been
characterized individually for their biochemical effects on actin filaments and their genetic effects on cellular
actin organization and function. However, it is becoming clear that most of these proteins do not function alone,
but rather in groups to perform their biological roles, and thus, new approaches are needed to define how they
work in concert to perform their cellular functions. Our lab is tackling this problem using advanced single
molecule TIRF microscopy to directly observe multi-component actin regulatory mechanisms in real time, and
testing these mechanisms using genetic, cell biological, biochemical, and structural approaches. Through this
approach, we have made fundamental new insights into actin regulation. For instance, we defined the first
collaborative actin nucleation mechanisms of formins (with Bud6 & APC). We discovered that formins and
Capping Protein can bind simultaneously at filament ends to accelerate each other’s dissociation. We showed
that Cofilin, AIP1, and Coronin work together via an ordered mechanism to sever and disassemble F-actin. We
discovered that Srv2/CAP works in conjunction with Cofilin and Twinfilin to depolymerize filament ends. In
parallel, we have combined genetics, cellular imaging, and separation-of-function mutants to dissect the
contributions of these mechanisms to actin-based processes in yeast and mammalian cells.
Moving forward, we will ask the following questions: what are the complete regulatory cycles of the two yeast
formins (Bni1 and Bnr1)? How is Arp2/3 complex-mediated actin nucleation balanced by its inhibitors (Coronin
and GMF) and activators (Las17/WASP and Abp1)? How is actin nucleation at the leading edge of motile cells
controlled by interactions among IQGAP1, APC and formins? How do interactions at filament ends between
Capping Protein and formins (and their in vivo binding partners) control actin network growth? How do the
filament severing and depolymerization mechanisms (Cofilin, AIP1, Coronin, Twinfilin, and Srv2/CAP) drive net
disassembly of actin under the assembly-promoting conditions of the cytosol? Are there actin-associated
proteins that accelerate the nucleotide state transition on F-actin to promote disassembly? In addition, we will
introduce new technologies and directions to our research, including in vitro reconstitution of cellular actin
structures, cryo-EM to study protein structure, cell-free extracts to genetically-biochemically dissect actin
mechanisms, and a systems-level approach to determine how genetic disruptions in individual actin regulators
affect the cellular levels, localization, and functions of the remaining actin-associated proteins.

Mosquito-borne disease is a major source of human misery, sickening hundreds of millions and killing
hundreds of thousands of people annually. The yellow fever mosquito Aedes aegypti is a primary vector for the
viruses that cause dengue, Zika and chikungunya and other diseases. In addition to its medical importance, Ae.
aegypti is increasingly used for molecular genetic studies of mosquito vector biology. Understanding Ae.
aegypti biology will provide basic science insights into this mosquito vector’s development, physiology and
behavior, help inform implementation of control efforts and potentially suggest new control strategies.
Improving approaches for genetic investigations in Ae. aegypti will facilitate these efforts.
 To date, genetic investigations in Ae. aegypti often rely on CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene targeting to
create strains of homozygous mutant animals in which a gene of interest has been disrupted. While extremely
valuable, substantial effort is required to create each mutant and the mutants obtained lack cell-specificity. To
address these limitations, we propose to establish a cell-specific, modified CRISPR/Cas9 (CmC) toolkit for Ae.
aegypti. CmC is designed to decrease the effort required to examine the impact of disrupting a gene of interest,
allow the cells in which a gene is acting to be determined and aid the study of essential genes.
We propose to achieve these goals in two aims:
Aim #1: Introduce the tools for Cell-specific modified CRISPR/Cas9 (CmC) into Ae. aegypti
In aim 1a, we design a strategy and build tools for creating mosquito strains that express modified Cas9
transgenes designed to allow optimization of Cas9 levels. In aim 1a2, we use these tools to create mosquitoes
that express modified Cas9 transgenes in a specific subset of sensory neurons. In aim 1b, we create transgenes
that express multiple gRNAs in a cell-specific fashion to specify the genes targeted.
Aim 2: Implement CmC in a subset of sensory neurons as well as pan-neuronally
In aim 2a, we test the system, using the tools built to identify an optimal strain which promotes robust cell-
specific gene disruption in a subset of sensory neurons, without causing cell death. In aim 2b, we construct
mosquito strains that will enable broad neuron-specific gene disruption, which should be of wide utility.

Both inputs to the brain and outputs from the brain occur over a broad range of timescales and
in many cases repeat rhythmically. Rhythmic changes in gene expression have been studied
in the brain only in the context of circadian rhythms. Additionally, shorter-than-a-day (ultradian)
rhythms have been sparsely reported and it is unknown how these rhythms originate,
particularly at the molecular level and whether they interact and/or share part of the
timekeeping machinery utilized by the circadian clock. Understanding how these rhythms are
generated and maintained will illuminate new aspects of brain gene expression and physiology
and open unexplored areas of research.
In an effort to reveal RNA oscillations at different timescales in the fly brain, we profiled fly brains
by RNAseq every two hours for three days. By analyzing these data, we identified dozens of
RNAs oscillating with 6-, 12-, and 24-hour rhythms in the brain. Interestingly, enrichment
analysis shows that more than half of these genes are highly expressed in the glia, suggesting
this cell type has oscillators operating at different timescales. The importance and novelty
of these results are two-fold: a. they demonstrate, for the first time, the presence of ultradian
RNA oscillations in the fly brain; b. suggest the existence of oscillators operating at
different timescales (circadian and ultradian) in the glial cells. In this context, the present
proposal aims to comprehensively identify the mechanisms responsible for ultradian
rhythmic gene expression in the glial cells within the fly brain. Our work will shed light on
new mechanisms of ultradian expression in flies for the first time. In addition, we will identify
and characterize new timekeeping or timer-like mechanisms operating in glial cells that also
have a circadian clock. Last, our work will provide new information and lead to developing tools
to perturb and investigate these rhythms in the future.
In sum, we are convinced that this project will uncover new modes of timed regulation of
transcription and physiology within the brain, which might be of vast importance beyond
Drosophila and uncover potential connections between ultradian and circadian oscillators
within these cells. This pioneering study will set the stage for further studying the role of
oscillations in the glia, a key cell type in the brain, as well as to understand the mechanism and
role of ultradian rhythms in general. As circadian rhythms have been linked to numerous diseases
including depression and sleep disorders, the present proposal has obvious implications for
human health.

Control of RNA metabolism is emerging as a major hub for regulation in the brain. Therefore, it is not
surprising that there is a strong link between perturbation of RNA metabolism and a number of neurological
and neurodegenerative diseases. These include Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) in which Tau protein and Aß42
fragments have been shown to interact and/or modulate directly or indirectly RNA binding proteins and RNA
metabolism in general. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are highly abundant RNAs produced by circularization of
specific exons. Interestingly, circRNAs accumulate in an age-dependent manner in neural tissues suggesting
their relevance to age-related homeostasis and/or pathogenesis. Indeed, specific circRNAs accumulate in
the brains of individuals with Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s diseases. However, how these circRNAs are
involved in the pathogenesis of those and other neurodegenerative diseases is largely unknown.
We recently developed systems to down- or up-regulate circRNAs in Drosophila. Using these tools, we
demonstrated the functionality of these molecules in vivo. We generated a resource to knock down (KD) the
110 more abundant circRNAs and found that KD of particular circRNAs results in different brain-related
phenotypes. Interestingly, we identified 35 circRNAs that when knocked down alter lifespan. Further data
shows that expression of some circRNAs is toxic for the aging fly, with links to aging and potentially
neurodegeneration. In addition, we found that KD of some circRNAs lead to specific behavioral and motor
defects, many of which are age-dependent. In addition, we observed changes in the levels of circRNAs in
Drosophila models of AD or other neurogenerative diseases. Here we aim to uncover the functions and
mechanisms of action of circRNAs during AD. To do so, we will use Drosophila AD models and perform a
genomic screening to determine if modulation of individual circRNAs can alter the progression and outcome
of the disease. Moreover, we will also test potential mechanisms by which circRNAs could alter AD including
nucleation of aggregates, altering mitochondrial function, autophagy, apoptosis, and/or inflammation.
In sum, the present proposal will reveal new roles of circRNAs during AD. As we will perform the
experiments in a system that has high and functional levels of circRNAs (the fly CNS) the present results will
be meaningful and could be later extended to mammalian models. We are aware of the limitations of the AD
fly models but this is the only system in which the full extent of interaction with a large number of circRNAs
can be assessed. Moreover, as we have already found that some circRNAs alter aging, the chances of
success are high. This will be a pioneering work in this new and important area of research and we are
confident that our findings will open a new pathway for studying the roles of circRNAs in AD. Our project
builds on exciting preliminary results and the unique and constantly evolving expertise of our group.

Transcription dominates the gene expression landscape of circadian rhythms and a number of neuroscience
areas. Yet post-transcriptional regulation, including translational regulation and the role of RNA binding
proteins (RBPs), has become increasingly recognized as important in recent years. Moreover, understanding
the roles of RBPs in diverse cell types and diseases and ultimately therapeutic intervention requires identifying
the RNA targets of RBPs. The ribosome can be considered a RBP, so this focus on post-transcriptional
regulation and RBP targets includes identifying ribosome-associated transcripts, namely RNAs that change
their translational status under defined circumstances. RBP identification is particularly challenging from small
numbers of cells, e.g., cancer stem cells within a large, heterogeneous solid tumor or discrete neuronal
subtypes. These settings preclude traditional biochemistry and therefore require new approaches. Two new
methods recently appeared, TRIBE and STAMP, which exploit the RNA editing enzymes ADAR and APOBEC,
respectively. Their ribosome versions, Ribo-STAMP and Ribo-TRIBE, are even more recent and fuse a
ribosomal protein to the editing enzymes. This is so that the enzyme will be near RNAs that are being
translated and will “mark” them by changing their sequence. These edits are identified by mRNA sequencing
and straightforward computational methods, even from single cells. We propose to compare Ribo-STAMP and
Ribo-TRIBE side-by-side in mammalian cell culture systems, to assess their efficacy and to determine the
optimal configuration of ribosome-editing enzyme fusions. We also propose to develop Ribo-TRIBE for use in
Drosophila; we recently discovered that STAMP does not work in this organism, which limits us to TRIBE. We
will then extend these methods to the more biological context of neurons, from Drosophila as well as from
mouse brains. To complement these efforts, we will develop an extension of the TRIBE/STAMP theme called
Nanobody-editing. It consists of fusing the editing enzyme, ADAR or APOBEC, to a GFP-nanobody, which will
then deliver the editing enzyme to any GFP-tagged RNA binding protein or GFP-tagged ribosome. The
chimeric, recombinant protein will be used in vitro as a recombinant protein or expressed in vivo. Nanobody-
editing will facilitate identifying RBP and ribosome targets, because already existing GFP-tagged RBP or
ribosomes can serve as substrates. Moreover, in vitro editing will in many cases obviate the need to generate
new transgenes and transgenic animals. Lastly, TRIBE and as well as Ribo-TRIBE will be used to characterize
translational regulation “around the clock” within a few key Drosophila circadian neurons. These efforts will
deepen our understanding of circadian gene expression regulation as well as provide the community with new
tools with which to study translation in important but challenging biological systems.

Neurons have classically been defined by the neurotransmitter they release. This “identity” has
been considered to be both singular (i.e. one transmitter) and immutable (i.e. genetically
hardwired). While the astonishing prevalence of cotransmission has changed thinking about the
singularity of neurotransmitter identity there has been considerably less appreciation of the
ability of neurons to exhibit plasticity in their expression. Recently, we discovered that the
microRNA miR-190 is a potent regulator of adult sleep. Spatial and temporal mapping of its site
of action demonstrates that it is required during pupation in a population of cells that transcribes
both cholinergic and glutamatergic genes but differentiates to become a small subset of the
adult glutamatergic neurons. This subset includes components of the core sleep homeostasis
circuit. We will test the hypothesis that a neurotransmitter plasticity event is critical to function of
the mature circuit and that it provides a novel mechanism for establishing, and potentially
modifying, the sleep set-point of the homeostatic machinery.
Aim 1 will determine the role of neurotransmitter plasticity in the control of adult sleep, with a
focus on understanding the circuit-level changes.
Aim 2 will investigate the role of neuronal activity in transmitter switching and homeostat
plasticity, with a focus on understanding the molecular events.
In this proposal, we bring the power of Drosophila genetics to bear on this novel and important
type of plasticity. We demonstrate that programmed transmitter plasticity during pupal life is
crucial to adult function of the sleep circuitry. The genetic reagents we have developed will allow
us to address basic mechanisms underlying transmitter plasticity in the context of both the
developing and mature nervous systems and, for the first time, link this type of plasticity to
sleep.

The goal of this proposal is to understand how cellular membrane trafficking machinery controls the packaging
and release of extracellular vesicle (EV) cargoes from synapses in vivo. EVs are small membrane-bound
vesicles released by numerous cell types, including neurons, carrying cargoes critical for signaling and
disease. However, we understand very little about how EV cargo traffic is spatially and temporally regulated
within the polarized and complex morphology of neurons. We have developed tools to track and manipulate EV
traffic at Drosophila presynaptic terminals in vivo, and discovered that flux of cargoes through a plasma
membrane-recycling endosome route determines whether they are locally sorted for packaging and release in
EVs, rather than depleted from synapses by retrograde transport. Recycling endosomes have primarily been
studied in non-neuronal cells, and very little is known about their lifetime, functions, or dynamics at presynaptic
terminals. We do know that recycling endosomes play critical roles in signaling, neuronal morphogenesis, EV
traffic, and synaptic transmission. Understanding and therapeutically intervening in these important processes
will require a deeper knowledge of the mechanisms of neuronal recycling endosome function. In this proposal,
we will elucidate the mechanisms of synaptic EV cargo and recycling endosome traffic in vivo. To achieve
these goals, we will use Drosophila genetics, biochemistry, high-resolution microscopy, and live cell imaging.
1) We will determine the functions, dynamics, and regulation of different types of synaptic recycling
endosomes. To this end, we will develop new tools and approaches to define and control functionally distinct
recycling compartments at synapses. Using these tools, we will test novel mechanistic hypotheses for how
membrane traffic machinery sorts cargoes at synaptic recycling compartments. 2) We will determine how EV
cargo traffic depends on distinct modes of synaptic endocytosis: clathrin-mediated endocytosis, which operates
under low neuronal activity and activity-dependent bulk endocytosis, which operates during intense neuronal
activity. These experiments will ascertain if EV fate is determined by different modes of internalization, how
recycling endosomes contribute to these functions, and provide new mechanisms to link activity, endosomal
traffic, and EV release. Given the conserved nature of synaptic membrane trafficking machinery, our findings
and tools will lay the foundation for new insights into EV traffic in many aspects of nervous system function,
including in human neurological disease.

 Despite the progress in molecular therapy and immunotherapy, multiple underlying cellular mechanisms
cause resistance to cancer therapy. There are urgent needs to develop innovative approaches to meet these
challenges. The proposed study is to develop subcellular enzyme-instructed self-assembly (sEISA), which
includes mitochondrial EISA (mitoEISA) and cytoplasmic EISA (cytoEISA), for generating molecular nanofibers
to overcome drug resistance and immunosuppression in cancer therapy. Our preliminary studies have shown
that sEISA selectively targets the mitochondria of cancer cells and minimizes drug resistance. Most importantly,
our preliminary study shows that sEISA inhibits the growth of immunosuppressive tumors in vivo. Thus, we
propose to further develop sEISA against drug resistant cancer cells and tumors. The proposed research has
three specific aims: Aim 1, developing mitoEISA for selectively targeting cancer cells; Aim 2, developing
cytoEISA for minimizing drug resistance and immunosuppression; and Aim 3, evaluating sEISA in ovarian
cancer xenograft murine models. The central hypothesis is that sEISA spatiotemporally generates molecular
nanofibers, which interact with multiple cellular proteins and interrupt multiple cellular processes inside cancer
cells to minimize drug resistance. Our preliminary results support the central hypothesis. The innovation is that
the mechanisms of the action of the molecular nanofibers significantly depart from the ligand-receptor dogma of
the current anticancer drugs. The long-term goal of the proposed work is to develop sEISA to generate molecular
nanofibers for overcoming resistance in cancer therapy. We anticipate that this research will provide innovative
anticancer approaches to address the problems of drug resistance and immunosuppression in cancer therapy,
thus ultimately will improve the survivorship of cancer patients.

The hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex (PFC) are both critical for learning and memory-guided behavior.
Coordination of neural activity between these regions is necessary for memory and cognitive processes,
however, the nature of these interactions and their roles are still unclear. We have established multiple timescale
neural representations in these regions for spatial learning and memory-guided behavior, with inter-regional
coordination during spatial firing and theta oscillations in exploratory behavior, and during sharp-wave ripple
(SWR) associated replay in sleep and awake immobility periods. Here, we will investigate the roles of these
physiological network patterns in learning and memory-guided navigation by combining behavioral methods in
rats, high-density recordings, and causal manipulation methods. (Aim 1) The influence of reward on mnemonic
representations is key to understanding the role of hippocampal-prefrontal activity patterns in memory-guided
behavior. In particular, it is known that reward changes influence hippocampal replay, and replay is thought to
play a role in linking actions to reward for reinforcement learning. To address this question directly, we have
developed methods in TH-Cre rats for optogenetic tagging and identification of dopaminergic ventral tegmental
area (VTA) neurons which encode reward prediction error, simultaneously with recordings from hippocampal
and prefrontal ensembles. We will record and manipulate VTA dopamine neuron firing to examine the influence
on replay and task representations in the hippocampal-prefrontal network during learning of new spatial rules.
(Aim 2) The hippocampus and prefrontal cortex are both known to be important for contextual encoding and
generalizing experiences across contexts, but the mechanisms are unclear. Our preliminary data show rule-
selective encoding by prefrontal neurons that is maintained across spatial contexts, whereas hippocampal CA1
neurons remap across contexts. Further, we have also found coordinated hippocampal-prefrontal ripples vs
independent cortical ripples with distinct reactivation patterns. We will examine whether hippocampal-prefrontal
ensembles underlie rule representations and contextual encoding, whether theta sequences maintain encoding
of current context, and test the hypothesis that replay during coordinated ripples enables associations across
contexts. (Aim 3) Goal representations are considered central to navigation, but the mechanisms for goal coding
and hippocampal-prefrontal representations for memory-guided navigation are still unclear. Our preliminary data
using a complex 2-d maze with flexible goal locations and barriers supports goal representations and replay by
hippocampal and prefrontal ensembles during navigation. We will test the hypotheses that hippocampal and
prefrontal replay events during immobility support planning of upcoming trajectories, and goal representations
impact theta sequences for online maintenance during trajectory execution. Overall, our results will provide novel
insight into fundamental learning and memory mechanisms that are affected in aging and memory disorders
such as Alzheimer’s disease.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Black Americans demonstrably suffer from a range of health disparities rising from a long history of
structural inequities and racism. Although Black Americans are slightly less likely to drink alcohol than the
general population, the rate of Black drinkers with alcohol use disorders (AUD) is comparable, representing 1.5
million Black Americans with AUD. Blacks suffer more negative consequences due to alcohol use such as
illnesses, injuries, criminal-legal involvement, and social problems. Recovery is a dynamic process of behavior
change leading to stable improvements in functioning, purpose and well-being. NIAAA further highlights
recovery as remission from AUD symptoms as well as cessation of heavy drinking. Recovery support services
and recovery community organizations aim to build recovery capital. Yet, to date little effort has been made to
consider recovery within population groups rather than across groups. A “centering in the margins” approach
emphasizes the need to examine experiences of racialized and minoritized populations. This proposed study to
advance recovery pathways and support services for Black men and women heeds that call. It is directly
responsive to RFA-AA-21-001 in its emphasis on health disparities in AUD populations, intersecting with the
RFA goals to advance culturally-informed measures and interventions, increase access to AUD services, make
services more appealing, and evaluate evidence-based practices. We do this with a focus on Black men and
women in AUD recovery. We thus aim to iteratively use quantitative and qualitative methods to capture and
assess questions related to AUD recovery in a heterogenous Black population, in partnership with a Black-
majority recovery community organization in Detroit. Specifically: (1) Use qualitative methods with a Black
population to (a) define AUD recovery pathways; (b) assess and refine a measure of recovery domains (e.g.,
relationships, living environment); and (c) identify and map community indicators that may facilitate or interfere
with AUD recovery. (2) Use quantitative methods to describe and assess the provision of AUD recovery
support services provided by the recovery community organization in terms of matching to needs, stage of
recovery and other client and community characteristics, by race/ethnicity. (3) Conduct a pragmatic
randomized controlled trial that builds on Aims 1 and 2 with a Black AUD recovery population, compared to a
treatment as usual group with in-person recovery support services, to determine the effectiveness of an added
phone+digital recovery support service intervention (i.e., provision of smartphones and guidance/support for
online recovery activities). The proposed study will enable a deep understanding of what recovery means to
Black men and women, how it can be measured, and how we can advance recovery journeys of Black
Americans with AUD. The results will be meaningful to Black individuals themselves, providers who treat
Blacks who have AUD, and to researchers and policymakers who need to better understand the meaning and
needs of a heterogenous US population.

 It is essential for the fate of an organism that key morphogenetic processes occur reproducibly even
under tissue damage or environmental perturbations. While much is known about how genetic redundancy and
regulation achieves robust development, less is understood about how a tissue mechanically ensures
reproducible shape change when perturbed. This project uncovers how populations of physically interacting
cells mechanically respond to challenging conditions and modify their collective behavior to still sculpt the
correct final shape.
 One way for cells to coordinate tissue-scale forces and movements is through direct mechanical
connections. In fact, many developing tissues exhibit supracellular networks of actomyosin connections that
link hundreds of cells. A large roadblock has been with the challenges of imaging and quantifying subcellular
protein at the tissue scale. I adapted a topological smoothing algorithm originally used to trace high-noise
filamentous structure of galaxies in the Universe to data to trace high-noise filamentous myosin structure in
confocal images. This allowed for the first quantification of a supracellular myosin network across an entire
tissue over developmental time. Subsequent analysis adopting techniques from network theory allowed me to
identify that the robust folding of the Drosophila fruit fly embryo during ventral furrow formation is mechanically
ensured by patterns in the supracellular network spanning its ventral cells.
 This newly discovered importance of supracellular networks in coordinating robust shape change
highlights the need for a comprehensive understanding of how supracellular networks form, and how their
patterns impact the function and robustness of a population of cells. Deciphering robustness at the tissue-level,
where the displacement and fate of hundreds of cells must be considered, requires techniques at the interface
of cell and developmental biology, biophysics and computer science. The proposed project will take a highly
interdisciplinary approach to identify how supracellular network patterns are controlled molecularly, at the cell
level, and via tissue constraints. As well, how heterogeneity in tissue-level patterns impacts morphogenetic
robustness will be addressed. Together this comprehensive study of the structure and function of supracellular
networks will represent a new way to interpret mechanical robustness across diverse developing tissues. As
well, a generalized description of mechanical robustness has the potential to uncover new paths to predict and
control tissue malformation, which would represent a significant advance for both developmental biology and
fetal medicine.

We like to think of taste as working relatively simply—a sweet taste is recognized as sweet by
virtue of activating certain cells on the tongue, and that information is used to drive neurons that
cause us to eat more of whatever food is in our mouths. The truth, however, is much more
interesting: a taste hits the tongue, and complex circuits in the brain go into action, passing
food-related information back and forth as the system as a whole decides whether the morsel is
palatable enough to swallow. My lab studies this process by recording from multiple parts of the
taste system while active rats are sampling various tastes. We have observed this decision-
making process in action in taste cortex, where neural ensembles report, in turn, that a taste is
on the tongue, that the taste is (say) sugar, and that it (the rat) currently likes the taste; this last
step appears to be one arrived at suddenly, in a moment of insight—the food rolls around in the
rat’s mouth for 0.5-1.5 seconds, and then the decision is made. This process clearly involves
and requires cortex, but it is just as clear that cortex doesn’t work alone. Here, we will do
rigorous tests of where that information in cortex comes from (specifically examining the roles
played by amygdala and hypothalamus), in the process revealing novel systems-level
mechanisms of taste processing. As a whole, this research project has the potential to
completely change the way we think about taste, and to usher in new thinking about perception
in general—thinking that makes a great deal more biological sense, given the complexity of
brain circuitry.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
Regulation of RNA metabolism is emerging as a major regulatory hub for gene expression control in tissues
like the brain and the muscle, which don’t undergo cell division. Therefore, it is not surprising that there is a
strong link between perturbation of RNA metabolism and a number of muscular and neurodegenerative
diseases including myotonic dystrophy (MD) and amyotrophic lateral dystrophy (ALS). For example, MD- 1
is provoked by the sequestration of the splicing factor MBNL1 encoded by the gene muscleblind-1. MBNL1
and another member of the MBL family (MBNL2) have important and overlapping functions in RNA
processing and transport, in particular in muscle and neurons.
Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a highly abundant, not well-characterized type of non-coding RNA. These
RNAs are generated by circularization of specific exons, and their functionality is still controversial. Recent
work from my laboratory has demonstrated that circRNA production competes with pre-mRNA splicing,
suggesting that circRNAs are general cis regulators of gene expression. We found by studying of MBL, the
Drosophila homolog of MBNL1, that this protein regulates the production of a subset of circRNAs, including
one generated from its own locus (circMbl). Work from the previous period demonstrated that circRNAs
generated from the mbl locus regulate gene expression, physiology and behavior. We found that these
circRNAs act in cis and are part of a self-regulatory loop that limits MBL expression. In addition, we found
that circMbl has functions in trans as knockdown (KD) of circMbl provokes several developmental,
physiological and behavioral phenotypes which are distinct but related to the ones observed upon MBL KD.
Together, our data demonstrates that circMbl and MBL work in related pathways but have distinct functions.
Here we aim to unravel the molecular and physiological implications of circMbl production and
function. This work will result in pioneering functional characterization of circRNAs in vivo and will be key for
understanding how MBL production and function are regulated in vivo. For doing so we will: identify MBL-
dependent and MBL-independent mechanisms of action of circMbl. We will follow by determining the
physiological and neural roles of mbl and circMbl isoforms. This project will illuminate essential
regulatory mechanisms of mbl expression and function. As or more importantly, this project is both technically
and intellectually innovative in its analysis of the roles of circRNAs in central aspects of physiology, and
behavior. Our project builds on strong preliminary results and the unique and constantly evolving expertise
of our group.

This proposal aims to determine how the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is regulated in neurons at rest and during
neuronal activity. The ER is a contiguous membrane-bound compartment, which forms a network of tubules that
extends to the periphery of neurons and forms contacts with other organelles, controlling processes such as lipid
transfer, organelle scission, and calcium signaling. Patients with neurodegenerative disorders, such as
Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia (HSP), often have mutations in genes that disrupt ER structure and ER contacts.
However, our understanding of ER function in neurons primarily comes from studies of non-neuronal cells. The
complex morphologies and elongated structures of neurons impose unique challenges for secretory and
endosomal membrane trafficking pathways. In particular, endosomes are vital for conveying long-distance
signals within neurons and packaging cargoes for intercellular signaling through extracellular vesicles. We
currently know very little about how ER contacts regulate neuronal endosomal compartments, or how the
structure of the neuronal ER is modified by activity. This project will use Drosophila and mammalian neuronal
systems to examine ER-endosome contacts in neurons and to study how neuronal activity regulates the ER.
The Drosophila neuromuscular junction is an excellent system to study the ER because it is genetically tractable,
and easily accessible for live imaging and electrophysiology. On the other hand, mammalian neuronal cultures
provide homogeneous material for biochemical studies, and can show if findings in Drosophila are evolutionarily
conserved. First, this proposal will determine how the HSP-linked gene Atlastin, which controls the assembly of
the ER into a reticular network, affects ER-endosome contacts in Drosophila and mammalian neurons (Aim1a,c).
Atlastin mutant synapses will be examined to uncover the mechanistic basis of the observed structural and
dynamic defects in the ER, as well as the accumulation of endosomal and extracellular vesicle cargoes (Aim1b).
Next, this study will examine how different neuronal activity paradigms (e.g. spontaneous vs. mild vs strong
stimulation) regulate the dynamics of the ER and ER-endosome contacts in Drosophila (Aim2a). Finally,
proximity labeling approaches will also be used in hippocampal neurons to identify candidate proteins at ER
contacts that are regulated by neuronal activity, to lay the foundation for future functional studies in Drosophila
(Aim2b). To achieve these research goals, the proposed training plan will expand the PI’s experimental skillsets
in various microscopy techniques, construction of genetic sensors, mammalian neuronal culture, and new coding
skills for image analysis such as image restoration and particle tracking. The career development plan focuses
on strengthening the PI's publication record, transitioning to an independent research position, and promoting
diversity, equity, and inclusion in science. Overall, the MOSAIC K99/R00 will allow the PI to gain necessary skills
to become an independent researcher in the field of neuronal cell biology and membrane trafficking.

Frailty is a state of depleted physiologic reserve that is common in older adults. To date there are no proven
therapies to prevent frailty beyond recommendations to adhere to a healthy lifestyle. Frailty is associated with
chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease (CVD), through shared pathophysiology mediated in part by
inflammation. Statins are the mainstay of CVD prevention and have effects beyond lipid lowering, including
reducing inflammation. Yet, many adults aged 75 and older are not taking statins due to a lack of evidence in
this age group. The ongoing PREVENTABLE trial will test the effect of atorvastatin 40mg vs placebo in 20,000
adults aged 75 and older free of CVD for the primary outcomes of survival free of dementia and disability, and
secondarily for incident CVD. However, whether statins can slow frailty has not been previously tested and is
not in the parent trial’s protocol. Thus, the proposed study is critical to establish whether statins may prevent or
slow the progression of frailty. PREVENTABLE provides a unique opportunity to test the effect of statins on
frailty using the two leading prevalent conceptual frameworks for quantifying frailty: the Rockwood cumulative
deficit frailty index (Rockwood FI) and Fried physical phenotype. As part of the parent trial, participants will
have a Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) performed at baseline and assessment of weight loss. A
funded Physical Performance ancillary study will support the administration of the SPPB at annual follow-up in
2500 participants and annual questionnaires will quantify other domains of frailty, including fatigue and physical
activity. The proposed PREVENTABLE Frailty Ancillary Study will complement the main trial by cleaning and
harmonizing EHR, claims, and trial data to calculate a Rockwood FI for all trial participants (n=20,000), and in
the Physical Performance subset (n=2,000), add annual grip strength and weight loss assessments to
complete the Fried phenotype. Finally, an annual blood sample will be collected in the same 2,000 participants
to measure markers of inflammation, neurodegeneration, and other measures to augment the Rockwood FI
with systematically collected routine labs, calculate a lab-FI, and examine Geroscience pathways to determine
the effect of statins on markers of inflammation and biologic aging. The frailty ancillary study will augment the
parent trial and existing ancillary study to determine whether statins: 1) lower the risk of incident frailty defined
according to the Rockwood FI in the entire trial population and Fried physical phenotype in a subset, and 2)
slow the progression of frailty over time according to the Rockwood FI in the entire trial population and Fried
phenotype in a subset. Finally, in the subset with annual blood samples, we will determine the effect of statins
on an FI augmented with labs and a lab-only FI. We will also explore the effect of statins on inflammation and
other hallmarks of aging. Leveraging the infrastructure of the PREVENTABLE trial and its Physical
Performance ancillary study, this timely and cost-effective proposal represents an exceptional opportunity to
test the possibility of statins as a treatment for frailty and biologic aging in a randomized setting.

Violence and humanitarian crises are common in the lives of children around the world, particularly in low- and
middle-income countries. Exposure to war-related violence is detrimental to the mental health of parents and
children, but research exploring mechanisms by which emotional and behavioral disruptions are transmitted to
subsequent generations remains nascent, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa. To help address this gap, a study
of war-affected youth has been underway since 2002 following a cohort of war-affected children—many, both
male and female, former child soldiers—in Sierra Leone into young adulthood, and now parenthood. A prior
NICHD-funded R01 (R01HD073349) demonstrated how childhood war-related trauma and loss contributed to
mental health problems in adulthood. In 2017, a cross-sectional sample of intimate partners and biological
offspring was added to the sample to examine linkages between early trauma exposure and both intimate
partner and parent-child relationships. Knowledge to date of how war-related stressors “get under the skin,” to
become heritable biophysical traits and the implications for the mental health of the next generation remain
limited. Of relevance are the Research Domain Criteria-related constructs of self-regulation and stress
reactivity and how they influence emotional, cognitive and social functioning of children. The proposed
research comprises a significant advance in the 20-year history of this study by advancing understanding of
potential biological embedding of stress responses intergenerationally. Building on four prior waves of data
collection, biological measures of stress reactivity and self-regulation (autonomic nervous system reactivity,
inflammation, telomere length) will be collected in a sample of parents exposed to significant trauma in
childhood and extended also to intimate partners and offspring. Strong capacity-building collaborations with
Sierra Leone’s University of Makeni (UNIMAK) and Kenema Government Hospital (KGH) will support the
ethical collection of new stress biomarker data and clinical assessments of parent-child synchrony, health, and
anthropometric data in biological offspring aged 7–24. Key study innovations are (a) rare prospective data on
parental trauma exposure and longitudinal information on risk and protective factors operating across the
social ecology; (b) data on biological embedding of stress responses related to parental trauma; and (c) the
opportunity to examine both mental health and physiological outcomes in biological offspring in war-affected
families over time. Advanced statistical techniques (e.g., latent class growth models, structural equation
models, lagged effects models) will articulate mechanistic pathways and priority targets for intervention.
Collaborations between investigators, UNIMAK, KGH, as well as community advisory boards will inform study
implementation, ensure strong retention of participants, and provide channels for dissemination. Analyses will
inform screening tools to identify families for preventive interventions. Intervention targets identified have
implications not just for war-affected settings, but also for assisting diverse populations affected by violence
and trauma, including migrants and refugees.

Polarized cells in retain their shape in every cell cycle and this is essential to their proper function. Anomalies
in polarized cell shape can result in cancer, metabolic disorders, and loss of tissue integrity. Here, we will
investigate a long-standing question of how cells consistently regain their polarity after each round of division.
This investigation will be conducted using the fission yeast, Schizosaccharomyces pombe model system that
provides many well characterized genetic tools to manipulate conserved proteins that influence cell shape
following division. Cdc42 is the major regulator of polarized growth. In fission yeast, cells halt polarized Cdc42
activation and consequent growth at the cell ends during mitosis. After completion of division, these cell ends
resume Cdc42 activation and cell growth. After division, Cdc42 activation and polarized growth always
resumes in a monopolar manner from the old end that pre-exists from the previous generation. The cell
transitions to bipolar growth when Cdc42 activation also resumes at the newly formed cell end in the G2 phase
of the cell cycle. Our preliminary data indicate that resumption of Cdc42 activation at the old end after division
and transition to bipolar activation in G2 are cell cycle dependent. Our central hypothesis is that Cdc42 is
differentially regulated at the cell ends by distinct cell-cycle-dependent cues to establish the cell polarization
pattern. We will test this hypothesis by pursuing the following specific aims, [1] Determine how Cdc42
activation resumes at the cell ends in the G1/S phase; [2] Elucidate how a memory of growth from the previous
cell cycle enables the pre-existing old end to initiate Cdc42 activation first; [3] Explain how the transition from
monopolar to bipolar growth occur in G2 phase. With this project we expect to mechanistically understand how
Cdc42 activation and associated growth patterns are modulated in different cell cycle stages. We will examine
how signals from one cell cycle inform the growth pattern in the next generation. This will provide much needed
insights into the principles that preserve polarized cell shape in complex systems. Due to the conserved nature
of the proteins involved in this investigation, we expect that our findings will be relevant cell shape control in
higher eukaryotes and provide potential therapeutic or diagnostic targets for diseases such as cancer.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) currently affects 1 in 59 children in the United States, 80% of whom are male,
and is characterized primarily by impaired social interaction/communication. Prenatal exposure to air pollution
has been implicated in the etiology of ASD, as well as many other neuropsychiatric disorders. However, the
mechanisms by which air pollution alters the development of social circuits in the brain remains unknown.
Importantly, there are large social disparities in environmental toxin exposure whereby marginalized communities
bear the greatest burden of exposure. Using a novel mouse model that combines an environmental toxin (diesel
exhaust particles; DEP) with an ethologically relevant maternal stressor (resource deprivation; MS), our
preliminary data show that these exposures in combination, but neither alone, induce robust deficits in social
interaction in male, but not female offspring. This is line with a model in which maternal psychosocial stress
unmasks vulnerability to environmental toxins in offspring. ASD is increasingly recognized as a whole-body
disorder. Gastrointestinal symptoms and changes in the composition of the gut microbiome are present in more
than 50% of individuals with ASD. Studies using animal models suggest a causal link between the gut
microbiome and social behavior, but this has not been studied in the context of environmental toxins. During the
K99 phase of this proposal, in Aim 1, I propose to further my training in the analysis of the gut microbiome to
ask whether cross-fostering of DEP/MS pups at birth can prevent shifts in the gut microbiome (assessed using
metagenomic sequencing). The dopamine system supports social interaction, is sensitive to microbial signaling,
and my preliminary data suggests is down-regulated following DEP/MS exposure. Thus, in Aim 2, I propose to
learn in vivo optogenetic techniques to test whether activation of the mesolimbic dopamine reward pathway is
sufficient to restore social behavior following DEP/MS. During the R00 phase, in Aim 3, I will use the techniques
acquired during the K99 phase to determine whether changes in the gut microbiome are responsible for changes
in social behavior and dopamine signaling in DEP/MS offspring. Moreover, I will use the preliminary data
gathered in Aim 1 to ask what potential metabolites or molecular mechanisms might be altered following
DEP/MS. Finally, I will ask whether microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain, play a key role in mediating
these microbiome-driven changes. Together, these experiments will elucidate the ways in which pollutants and
stress synergize to produce dysregulation of the gut-brain axis and deficits in social behavior.
 This proposal will significantly advance my career development by providing me with new training in
cutting-edge techniques such as in vivo optogenetics and metagenomic sequencing. Thus, it will help me to
establish my own independent line of work and the preliminary data obtained herein will serve as a foundation
for future R01 funding.

There is a widespread recognition that mental health is often neglected, under-resourced, and
underfunded, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) 1, 2. Experiencing traumatic
events as a child is often linked to mental health problems and higher levels of stress reactivity and
impact one's entire ecology with long-term intergenerational consequences 3. The treatment gap, is
more than 50% in all countries and can be as high as 90% in the least resourced countries 4. Sierra
Leone is one of many low and middle-income countries (LMICs) that have encountered challenges in
providing mental health services to their population, particularly children and adolescents 5-6. This has
been compounded by the country's experiences of war and the Ebola outbreak. The parent grant for
the proposed supplement is a mixed-method, longitudinal study evaluating the long-term effects of
war and trauma on parents and their relationships with their children, families, and communities.
Previous studies have noted the limitations of relying on self-reported family dynamics in post-
conflict settings, including Sierra Leone 7. There is a need for observational techniques and
instruments that are context-specific, current, biologically based, and tailored to fathers to supplement
self-report methods. The findings from this study will inform the development of decision-support
tools for lay-worker-delivered prevention models to support family interventions to address specific
needs, based on the family's distinct pattern of risk and protective factors.
 Specific Aims of the parent grant: The primary aims of the parent grant are as follows:
 (1) Investigate the biological embedding and long-term mental health consequences of war-related
trauma in a longitudinal sample of war-affected youth who have become parents (N=394).
(2) Examine associations between parental war-related trauma exposure, mental health, and biological
and physiological indicators of emotion, cognition, and social functioning in offspring aged 7–24
(N=410). (3) Identify and examine how modifiable risk and protective factors operate to identify
priority intervention targets to improve the physical and mental health of war-affected children and to
develop screening tools to identify families at risk.

Project Summary
Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are increasingly recognized as rewarding targets against which powerful
therapeutic drugs can be devised. This is perhaps best demonstrated by the remarkable success of the series
of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibody drugs developed to treat cancer. Despite the excitement, antibody-based drugs do
have a few limitations, including modest stability, lack of oral availability, poor tissue penetration and inability to
reach intracellular targets. Nevertheless, small molecule based PPI inhibitors remain scarce as large PPI
interfaces cannot be efficiently blocked by small molecule drugs. The shortcomings of these two major drug
modalities towards PPI inhibition rekindled people’s interest in peptides as an alternative modality. Peptides, as
a quintessential example of medium-sized molecules, would be able to forge large enough molecular contact to
block a PPI interface. On the other hand, they hold promise to overcome the limitations of antibody drugs,
particularly in terms of oral availability. The enthusiasm in peptide drugs was further fueled by the advent of
genetically encoded screening platforms such as phage display, which enables rapid screening of peptide
libraries. However, phage display often fails to reveal PPI inhibitors of desired potency, presumably due to the
overly simplistic structures of natural peptides in contrast to peptide natural product-based drugs. Over the past
few years, our group have made a number of exciting advances towards expanding the chemical space of phage
display libraries. First, we have developed novel warheads that elicit reversible covalent binding of amines such
as a lysine side chain. Second, we have successfully constructed covalent binding phage libraries and
demonstrated their utility in PPI inhibitor discovery. Third, we have developed highly efficient chemistries for
phage modification to give backbone rigidified peptide macrocycle libraries. These advances pave the road for
the further exploration of phage libraries of complex structured peptides. With this MIRA application, we seek to
develop novel phage libraries that display various covalent warheads and/or backbone rigidifying elements.
These phage libraries will be assessed for PPI inhibitor discovery against a panel of model proteins as well as
proteins that enable bacterial immune evasion or confer antibiotic resistance. Our proposed research will allow,
for the first time, pharmacologic interrogation of host-pathogen PPIs as potential targets of novel antibacterials.
Importantly, the proposed work will yield a powerful platform for discovering non-antibody based PPI inhibitors,
which will have broad impact far beyond the scope of this proposal.

Streptococcus pneumoniae is a leading cause of pneumonia, acute otitis media (ear infection), and
meningitis in the United States. S. pneumoniae remains an important pathogen despite a vaccine and
effective antibiotic treatments due to increasing levels of antibiotic resistance and vaccine evasion
through serotype switching. Virulence in S. pneumoniae is mediated by a complex gene regulatory
program that is only partially understood. In many bacteria, trans-acting small non-coding RNAs
(sRNAs) play key roles in regulating stress and virulence responses. While many sRNAs have been
identified in S. pneumoniae via high-throughput sequencing studies, biological function has been
assigned to only a few. The goal of this exploratory proposal is to identify the mRNA targets for sRNA
candidates in S. pneumoniae, focusing specifically on those implicated in mediating virulence. We have
two aims to reach this goal: First, we will determine the mRNA targets for a set of prioritized sRNA
candidates implicated in S. pneumoniae virulence during mouse infections. Second, we will
characterize the entire S. pneumoniae sRNA:mRNA interaction network. To achieve the first aim, we
will use MS2-afinity purification coupled with RNA sequencing (MAPS) to identify mRNA targets for a
set of prioritized sRNAs associated with fitness defects in mouse infections. MAPS tags each sRNA
individually to allow specific capture of sRNA targets, but allows unbiased identification of potential
mRNA partners via high-throughput sequencing of the captured RNAs. This approach will be combined
with computational tools that predict the targets of sRNAs using thermodynamic properties. A set of 5-
10 of the most promising mRNA targets identified from the combined approaches will be assessed
using reporter gene assays to validate the sRNA impact on gene expression. To achieve the second
aim, we will use RIL-seq, a technique which captures mRNA:sRNA pairing through crosslinking
followed by ligation. Subsequent sequencing identifies chimeric reads corresponding two interacting
RNAs. To enrich for sRNA:mRNA pairs, a FLAG-tagged RNA-binding protein partner to
immunoprecipitated the sRNAs. In S. pneumoniae, which lacks an RNA chaperone, we will use Cbf1,
an exonuclease shown to process sRNAs, to enrich our population. Taken together, our two aims will
identify mRNA targets for sRNA candidates associated with virulence, and move the field from
cataloging sRNA presence toward identification of sRNA biological function, and thus therapeutic
intervention.

Major challenges facing nephrology today are declining interest in the field and lack of innovation and novel
drug and device development. These factors may be related. Students who perceive nephrology as stagnant
may be attracted to other specialties, thereby robbing the nephrology workforce of talented students who could
innovate and advance the field. The R25 Funding Opportunity Announcement by NIDDK to spark interest in
nephrology is therefore timely and an exciting opportunity to address a major need in the evolution of
nephrology and the care of patients with kidney diseases. We propose the development of the Boston
University Kidney and Medical Engineering Program (BU-KIDMEP). Our ultimate goal is to inspire talented
young scholars to improve the lives of individuals with kidney disease through innovative technology solutions.
To accomplish this, we have designed a program that: 1) Identifies students interested in technology and
engineering across Boston University, with an emphasis on undergraduates; 2) Pairs students with a
mentoring team comprised of a research/technology expert and a nephrology expert; 3) Fosters a 6- to 24-
month long education program that includes didactic training, clinical immersion, and technology development;
4) Showcases research at capstone symposia; and 5) Tracks metrics to improve the program's success in
attracting students to technology and kidney disease.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
In mammals, insulin primarily regulates metabolism while insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) stimulates growth,
proliferation and differentiation. Aberrant production of IGF-1 is connected with different human diseases
including growth disorders such as Laron syndrome, acromegaly and Graves' orbitopathy as well as thyroid
eye disease (TED) and the early stages of diabetic nephropathy. In addition, circulating levels of IGF-1 are
increased in cancer patients and IGF-1 receptor (IGF1R) expression is upregulated in various tumor types.
Although the IGF1R system plays a key role in tumor progression and has been one of the most intensively
investigated molecular targets in cancer research, previous clinical attempts to develop IGF1R inhibitors have
largely failed. Thus, there is a critical knowledge gap regarding the underlying mechanisms of IGF1R inhibition
and an urgent need to develop novel IGF1R inhibitors. The data generated through my K01 grant has
expanded the family of insulin/IGF-like hormones and provided us a new tool to probe this complex system:
viral insulin/IGF-1-like peptides (VILPs). Previously, we chemically synthesized these VILPs and characterized
their function on the insulin receptor (IR)/IGF1R system using in vitro and in vivo assays. While most of the
VILPs are natural agonists of the IR and IGF1R, we showed that two VILPs in Mandarin fish ranavirus (MFRV)
and Lymphocystis disease virus-1 (LCDV1) are highly specific and potent antagonists of the IGF1R. This
discovery has opened up new avenues for understanding and studying IGF1R inhibition. The overarching goal
of this proposal is to examine unique antagonist effects of MFRV and LCDV VILPs on the IGF1R to elucidate
the underlying structural and molecular mechanisms of the IGF1R inhibition. Our central hypothesis is that the
VILPs will inhibit IGF1R signaling and IGF-1 related proliferation function via their unique interaction with the
IGF1R, differentially regulating post-receptor signaling pathways and IGF1R gene expression. We will test this
hypothesis based on two independent Aims. In Aim 1, we will test the hypothesis that VILPs engage with
human IGF1R in a unique way, recruit different substrates to the receptor and modify post-receptor signaling
while directly regulating IGF1R gene expression. We expect to determine the molecular and structural
mechanisms of the hIGF1R antagonism in vitro. In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that VILPs will specifically
inhibit IGF1R signaling in vivo without affecting IR signaling and decrease IGF-1 mediated growth without
affecting glucose metabolism. These findings will define the effects of VILP-mediated IGF1R inhibition using
two in vivo models of IGF-1 mediated growth and IGF-1 mediated tumor progression. This proposal is built on
the conceptual innovation based on our exciting discovery of the VILPs and their unique effects on IGF1R. We
propose using cutting-edge techniques and if proven right, these studies will transform our understanding of
the IGF1R inhibition and function as a proof-of-principle for the introduction of peptide-based inhibitors of the
IGF1R into the framework of human disease research.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Increased glomerular filtration rate (GFR), also known as glomerular hyperfiltration, is a common observation in
the early stage of diabetes and is considered a key risk factor for the later development of diabetic kidney disease
(DKD). Although the pathophysiological mechanisms of glomerular hyperfiltration in diabetes have not been fully
understood, the tubuloglomerular feedback (TGF) has been implicated. In particular, the “tubular hypothesis” is
now widely recognized. It describes that proximal tubular reabsorption of sodium and glucose via the sodium-
glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) is upregulated in the diabetic kidney, thereby reducing the NaCl delivery to the
macula densa, which decreases the TGF activity and increases the single-nephron GFR in an effort to normalize
NaCl excretion (SGLT2-NaCl-TGF pathway). We have recently identified a new and complementing mechanism
that increases GFR in the diabetic kidney: the increased tubular glucose load at the macula densa is sensed
through the apical sodium-glucose cotransporter 1 (SGLT1) and enhances the neuronal nitric oxide synthase
(NOS1)-derived nitric oxide (NO) generation, which blunts TGF responsiveness and likewise increases the
single-nephron GFR (SGLT1-NOS1-TGF pathway). SGLT2 inhibition is currently changing the perspectives of
antidiabetic therapy with significant renoprotective effects. The benefits of SGLT2 inhibition in the diabetic kidney
have been proposed to be largely independent of its blood glucose-lowering effect and mainly based on the
central role of this transporter in the “tubular hypothesis” of diabetic glomerular hyperfiltration and nephropathy.
In accordance with the “tubular hypothesis”, inhibition of SGLT2 increases the macula densa NaCl delivery and
reduces diabetic hyperfiltration and thereby protects the diabetic kidney. However, inhibition of SGLT2 also
increases glucose delivery to the macula densa, which is expected to decrease the TGF responsiveness through
the macula densa SGLT1-NOS1-TGF pathway, and thereby limit both the GFR-lowering effect of SGLT2
inhibition and its protective effects on kidney. Therefore, in the present proposal, we will examine the effects of
SGLT2 inhibition on the tubular glucose load at the macula densa, the macula densa NOS1/NO levels, and TGF
responsiveness in diabetic mice, and then determine the significance of the macula densa SGLT1-NOS1
pathway in the SGLT2 inhibition-induced alterations in TGF and GFR by using mouse models with SGLT1
knockout or macula densa-specific NOS1 knockout; moreover, we will compare the effects of dual
SGLT1/SGLT2 inhibition and selective SGLT2 inhibition on TGF activity, GFR and kidney injury in diabetic mice,
and further determine the significance of the TGF mechanism in these effects by using a mouse model that lacks
TGF due to macula densa-specific NKCC2 knockout. Successful completion of this proposal will establish the
opposing role of the macula densa SGLT1-NOS1-TGF pathway in the protective effects of SGLT2 inhibition on
diabetic glomerular hyperfiltration and kidney injury, and thus provide supportive and mechanistic evidence for
the use of dual SGLT1/SGLT2 inhibition in the treatment of DKD.

This proposal focuses on the fundamental question of how neuronal growth cones are guided to their targets. It
has long been established that growth cone navigation depends on regulated changes in both F-actin and
microtubule (MT) dynamics in response to guidance cues. However, the mechanisms by which these cues
bring about specific changes in growth cone MT dynamics are unresolved. This proposal takes aim at that
void, by investigating the function of the MT polymerase and ‘plus-end tracking protein’ (+TIP), XMAP215,
along with its regulatory mechanisms. Our recently published data identified an ability for XMAP215 to bind
directly to F-actin and promote MT extension into the growth cone. This is complemented by unpublished data
that kinase signaling modulates the ability of XMAP215 to promote MT-F-actin interaction. Our data support a
model in which XMAP215 mediates MT-F-actin coupling through structural domains distinct from those
regulating MT polymerization, and that XMAP215 converts signals from upstream guidance cues into changes
in cytoskeletal coordination, ultimately directing growth cone motility. We will test this in Xenopus laevis using
an array of complementary cell-based and biochemical approaches. The specific aims are: Aim 1 – Identify the
mechanism by which XMAP215 interacts with F-actin in vitro. We will determine the specific domain of
XMAP215 that binds to F-actin as well as identify how the binding is regulated. We will produce a variety of
deletion and phosphomutant XMAP215 proteins, and we will use a series of biochemical techniques including
F-actin/MT co-sedimentation binding assays, multi-wavelength TIRF microscopy with in vitro cytoskeletal
reconstitution assays, mass spectrometry, as well as EM experiments, to dissect the mechanism by which
XMAP215 binds to F-actin in vitro. Aim 2 - Determine how regulation of XMAP215 interaction with F-actin
modulates cytoskeletal dynamics and growth cone behaviors in cultured neurons. We will use structured
illumination microscopy (SIM), spinning disk confocal microscopy, and quantitative imaging analysis of +TIP
dynamics in cultured neurons, after expressing various XMAP215 mutants, to uncover new mechanistic
insights into how XMAP215 regulates MT-F-actin interactions in growth cones during axon outgrowth. Aim 3 -
Define how XMAP215 interaction with F-actin contributes to accurate axon guidance. We have discovered that
normal XMAP215 levels are required for cultured growth cones to be repelled from the axon guidance cue,
Slit2. We will use a combination of ex vivo and in vivo axon guidance assays to determine how growth cone
steering is impacted by the ability of XMAP215 to facilitate MT-F-actin interactions. The results of these Aims
will reveal the direct links between guidance cue signaling, kinase regulation of the only well-characterized MT
polymerase (XMAP215), and cytoskeletal coordination, within the context of growth cone steering. As such,
this proposed work has the potential to bring a long-needed mechanistic understanding to the question of how
extracellular cues govern cytoskeletal dynamics to effectively steer growth cones during neurodevelopment.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
Individuals with serious mental illness (SMI) are three times more likely to die prematurely than the general
population. Sixty percent of this premature death is attributable to inadequate care of chronic, co-morbid
medical conditions. A growing proportion of patients with SMI receive care in accountable care organizations
(ACOs) – health care delivery and finance systems, in which global payments and quality benchmarks are
used to incentivize quality care and lower spending. An increasing number of states are implementing ACO
models in their Medicaid programs, the primary source of health insurance for low-income Americans with SMI.
Medicaid ACOs exist in 12 states, caring for over 6% of the Medicaid population. Medicaid ACOs have the
potential to both improve and worsen access to, and quality of, care for low-income adults with SMI. While
financial structures that incentivize care coordination and programs that address health-related social needs
likely benefit those with SMI, inadequate global payments that fail to account fully for social adversities such as
homelessness could result in lower quality care. Certain features of Medicaid ACOs, e.g. leadership structure
or ACO size, may amplify the benefits or drawbacks of the ACO model for patients with SMI. Evidence from
Medicare ACOs has shown that smaller, provider-led ACOs and those serving a lower proportion of socially-
vulnerable patients perform better in terms of quality. However, no evidence exists on how Medicaid ACO
characteristics affect quality of care or the care experience of SMI adults. Since Medicaid ACOs are rapidly
proliferating, filling this evidence gap is critical and can inform the evolution of the ACO model to better achieve
the goal of mental health parity. In this K23 research plan, we propose to identify features of Medicaid ACOs
(e.g. provider-led vs. hospital-led ACOs) that produce the highest quality ACO care for adults with SMI. We
will undertake this research objective in three critical domains. First, we will study whether certain ACO types
tend to drop patients with SMI, a practice known as favorable risk selection (or “cherry-picking”). This
phenomenon can cause instability of ACO enrollment for patients, itself a marker of lower quality care.
Second, we will compare care access and quality among adults receiving care in different ACO types. Lastly,
we will use mixed methods to examine the care experiences of adults with SMI receiving care in different ACO
types, through in-depth interviews and subsequent integration of qualitative and quantitative findings. For the
first two aims, we will use Massachusetts All-Payer Claims Data and leverage the state’s unique auto-
assignment mechanism as a natural experiment to study favorable risk selection, access, and quality. Auto-
assignment refers to Medicaid randomly assigning individuals to ACOs, allowing us to compare outcomes
across ACO types without selection bias caused by patients self-selecting their ACO affiliation. The goal of my
K23 research is to guide policymakers and hospital administrators in shaping the Medicaid ACO model to
produce more stable, higher-quality ACO care for patients with SMI.

Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) that are clinically and pathologically similar display significant differences in
disease progression, therapeutic response, and overall survival. The limited accuracy of current prognostic
biomarkers is a major unmet clinical need, particularly in a tumor type rapidly rising in prevalence and incidence.
While genetic drivers have been identified, these genetic alterations are limited to cancer cells and do not provide
a systematic assessment of information encoded within the intact tumor microenvironment (TME), including the
role of the tumor architecture and the spatially organized immunological processes. For example, while emerging
evidence proposes a key role for tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in orchestrating an
immunosuppressive TME, patient-specific factors that mediate cell-to-cell interactions and localized chemokine
and cytokine signaling in NETs are currently unknown. To address this knowledge gap, work from our group on
single-cell transcriptomic profiling of NETs has established that TAMs display an adverse continuum of cell states
(i.e. not separated into the historical M1 or M2 groupings), while expressing tumor-specific chemokines and
cytokines involved in regulating key immune pathways. Our findings highlight the significant heterogeneity within
the myeloid compartments of NETs, particularly TAMs, and may offer potential promising targets for prognosis
and therapy. However, unlocking this potential requires the systematic understanding of the spatial distributions
and interactions of these different macrophage cell populations with both the cancer cell and lymphoid cell
populations, which together - as a multi-cellular system - dictate immunosuppression or activation. These
intricate spatial insights are still majorly lacking and obtaining them is only recently possible with the advent of
new spatial technologies. To understand the underlying processes that drive NET progression, as well as reveal
potential therapeutic vulnerabilities, we will test our hypothesis across two mutually reinforcing aims. In Aim 1,
we will identify the exact spatial composition, architecture and cellular crosstalk of the tumor and TME of archival
NETs and connect the obtained information with macrophage-centric signaling and processes. In Aim 2, we will
determine if systematic spatial distributions and interactions of the macrophage cell populations and NET-
specific chemokine profiles are associated with disease outcomes in NETs. The successful implementation of
the proposed studies could provide innovative and data-driven insights into complex macrophage biology and
concurrently establish high-dimensional profiling of the TME as clinical biomarkers, thereby transforming
prognostic stratification and clinical management for patients with NETs and potentially identifying novel
druggable targets within the tumor as a whole.

Children with severe respiratory and cardiopulmonary illness who need out-of-hospital (prehospital) emergency
care are vulnerable to error and preventable harm. Improving prehospital patient safety for children is a national
research priority. Video-consultation with pediatric experts on telemedicine platforms (expert teleconsultation) is
a promising intervention that has produced safer care for children in hospitals and narrowed gaps in access for
underserved communities. However, the potential safety benefits of expert teleconsultation remain largely
untapped by Emergency Medical Service (EMS) systems. Studies demonstrating efficacy of pediatric
applications are urgently needed to improve EMS technology adoption. This R03 application builds on skills,
experience, and pilot data from Dr. Boyle’s K23 award to compete for a future R01 award to support her transition
to research independence as a clinician scientist conducting prehospital trials. To prepare for a future efficacy
trial, Dr. Boyle worked with EMS providers to design a low-cost mobile platform for use in ambulances and adapt
a simulation model to assess the technical performance of prehospital teams in high-risk pediatric transports and
measure the effects of interventions on patient safety outcomes. She conducted a pilot simulation-based
randomized controlled trial (RCT) to test intervention acceptability, feasibility and estimate statistical parameters
for the future R01 efficacy trial. This work identified two gaps that must be addressed before progressing to the
larger trial. First, the primary assessment tool lacked accuracy as it measured harm indirectly via performance,
so needed further adaptation. Second, teleconsultants had relevant expertise but used unstructured
communication which lessened intervention fidelity. This R03 application leverages existing K23 pilot RCT video-
recordings and qualitative data to (1) adapt and validate the simulation performance checklist to measure serious
safety events, a clinically important patient centered outcome, and (2) refine intervention training to standardize
communication processes in prehospital teleconsultation encounters. In Aim 1, the study team will use a modified
Delphi process with expert consensus to develop a safety event checklist and apply it to K23 video-recordings
to gather validity evidence to support its use in the future trial. In Aim 2, the team will test the feasibility of using
a tool to measure intervention fidelity and combine this with qualitative K23 stakeholder feedback to refine the
intervention training protocol to standardize communication processes. This R03 will produce the necessary
measurement tools and standardized intervention training to compete for a future R01 award that tests the
efficacy of teleconsultation to reduce harm in children who require prehospital emergency care, a national
research priority.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT ABSTRACT
Hypoxic-ischemic brain injury in cardiac arrest survivors ranges in severity from mild cognitive impairment to per-
sistent vegetative state. Precise estimation of neurologic outcome (neuroprognostication) in this setting is crucial
to guide families and physicians in goals-of-care decisions and to improve allocation of critical care resources.
Outcome prediction tools include neurologic examination, neuroimaging, biochemical markers, and electrophysi-
ologic studies. Accurate neuroprognostication remains challenging, as previous studies assessing the prognostic
accuracy of these tools have been affected by withdrawal of life support due to perceived poor neurologic prog-
nosis (WLS-N), and thus subject to self-fulfilling prophecy bias. This bias, along with early pessimistic prognosti-
cation, most often leads to premature death of those dependent on life support, including some with potential for
good neurologic recovery. Consequently, the natural history of hypoxic-ischemic brain injury unbiased by the
effect of WLS-N has not been adequately investigated. In Brazil, the severity of hypoxic-ischemic brain injury is
assessed by prognostic tools similar to those used in the US; however, life-sustaining therapies are maintained
for prolonged periods due to cultural norms. This difference in practice, unbiased by WLS-N, allows for a unique
opportunity to observe the natural history of hypoxic-ischemic brain injury, and to identify true predictors of poor
outcome. The elucidation of the impact of WLS-N on the performance of neuroprognostic tools is a vital step
toward more accurate outcome prediction. This will be the first study to combine the advanced expertise from
leading international sites analyzing neuroimaging and electrophysiologic data applied to a population unbiased
by WLS-N, and to unveil the impact of self-fulfilling prophecy bias on the natural history of hypoxic-ischemic brain
injury and on the prediction performance of guideline-recommended neuroprognostic tools. We will prospectively
collect data on demographics, premorbid characteristics, details of cardiac arrest and resuscitation, post-cardiac
arrest care, detailed neurological examination findings, electrophysiologic studies and neuroimaging at standard-
ized time points, and assess functional outcomes at discharge and at 3, 6 and 12 months. Our goals are to: 1)
Determine the independent effect of WLS-N on mortality and overall outcomes, and 2) Demonstrate the
prognostic accuracy of current guideline-recommended tools in an uncensored population. As an ex-
ploratory aim, we will also develop independent, blinded multimodal neuroprognostic models for the US
and Brazil cohorts, and compare their performance. By completing this innovative project, we will understand
the impact of WLS-N on the natural history of hypoxic-ischemic brain injury and better characterize the timing of
recovery after cardiac arrest. These data will influence future neuroprognostication studies and trials of neuro-
therapeutics, as well as optimize the use of critical care resources. This study is the stepping stone to strength-
ening data on neuroprognostication by improving their reliability, thereby ultimately easing undue patient and
family suffering from prognostic uncertainty, and directing medical resources most efficiently.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
Juxtaglomerular (JG) cells are a cluster of specialized vascular smooth muscle (VSM) cells located in the wall of
each afferent arteriole (Af-Art) at the entrance to the glomerulus. On one hand, JG cells preserve most of the
characteristics of VSM cells, but on the other hand, they are distinguished from VSM cells by their unique
endocrine characteristics, specifically the synthesis and secretion of renin. Renin released from JG cells into the
circulation catalyzes the conversion of angiotensinogen to angiotensin I, the first and rate-limiting step of the
renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) cascade. Commensurate with the central role of RAAS in fluid
and electrolyte homeostasis, renin synthesis and secretion by JG cells is regulated by multiple inputs that
generally reflect the status of extracellular fluid volume. The most important among the control mechanisms of
renin release is a pressure-sensing mechanism, denominated as the intrarenal baroreceptor. It is believed that
JG cells can detect slight changes in perfusion pressure through the Af-Art and respond with precise amounts
of renin synthesized and secreted to the circulation in sync, therefore functioning as a mechano-sensitive
rheostat to maintain a steady-state level of Af-Art perfusion pressure and thus systemic blood pressure. However,
the nature of the intrarenal baroreceptor and in particular, the central questions about this pressure-sensing
mechanism: what the exact mechano-sensor is in JG cells and how it controls renin synthesis and secretion,
remain elusive. A novel technique, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), provides a new tool to further
understand the genetic and molecular basis of the intrarenal baroreceptor in JG cells. Our preliminary studies of
scRNA-seq analysis have revealed that a gene Sdc1 is not only highly and differentially expressed in JG cells
vs. VSM cells, but also positively correlated with Ren1 expression. Sdc1 encodes syndecan-1, a transmembrane
proteoglycan, which allows for the transfer of information about extracellular environment changes into the cell
that consequently affects intracellular activities. Thus, in this project, we aim to determine whether syndecan-1
is a key mechano-sensor of the intrarenal baroreceptor mechanism in JG cells that controls renin synthesis and
secretion, regulates the circulating RAAS, and thus contributes to the maintenance of fluid and electrolyte
homeostasis and blood pressure. Specifically, in Aim 1, we will determine the expression of syndecan-1 in the
kidney, especially in JG cells; moreover, we will examine the effects of different perfusion pressures on the renin
mRNA and protein expression levels in JG cells with the in vitro model of isolated/perfused juxtaglomerular
apparatus and in vivo model of aortic coarctation in wild-type (WT), global Sdc1 knockout (KO), and JG cell-
specific Sdc1KO mice. In Aim 2, we will examine the volume depletion (low perfusion pressure) or volume
expansion (high perfusion pressure)-induced changes in the renin expression levels in JG cells, circulating levels
of RAAS, renal vascular resistance, urinary sodium excretion, and blood pressure in WT, global Sdc1KO, and
JG cell-specific Sdc1KO mice.

Minoritized individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1D) have approximately 2% higher average A1c levels and twice
the rate of hospitalizations, complications, and mortality as their white counterparts. However, the efficacy trials
establishing the benefits of hybrid closed loop (HCL) pump therapy in T1D have been in more socially
advantaged and predominantly non-Hispanic white patients. Use of this transformative technology by individuals
with T1D from underserved communities remains very low. We plan to conduct a randomized effectiveness trial
- with broader eligibility criteria (including markedly elevated A1c) and longer (9 month) follow up than the pivotal
HCL efficacy trials - to evaluate the benefits, safety risks and treatment complications of HCL use in underserved
adults with T1D (Specific Aim 1). Primary outcome will be % time-in-range 70-180 mg/dL, and secondary
outcomes will include % time < 70 mg/dL, DKA events and body weight. The HCL arm in the trial will include
three HCL systems (BetaBionics iLet, Insulet OP 5, Tandem Control IQ) that vary in degree of automation and
user input required for operation. More automated systems could potentially better match the needs of
underserved individuals with competing life demands that limit diabetes self-care; however, the potential benefits
of automation are at the cost of less personal control of the system, including adjustments for work-shift changes
and activity. Specific Aim 2 incorporates the novel application of Ecological Momentary Assessment to examine
the lived experience with HCL (including benefits and burdens, the impact of life stressors impact on HCL use,
and how the match between HCL system functionality and the individual’s needs and expectations impacts on
user experience). In Specific Aim 3, in collaboration with a user-centered designer, we will apply the learnings
from the study to develop: 1) Improved HCL patient education and clinician support tools; and 2) Decision-aids
to guide patient selection of the HCL system that is most aligned with personal preferences and needs. These
optimized training materials and decision-aids will set the stage for the translation of our research findings into
increased adoption of HCL in underserved communities and improved shared decision-making by patients and
clinicians in the selection of HCL systems.

Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDPs) affect 10% of pregnancies in the United States and are associated with
future cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk, with significantly higher prevalence and worse outcomes among Black women
and women with low incomes. Timely identification and management of CVD risk factors (e.g., blood pressure control)
after HDPs leads to substantial and sustained improvements in cardiovascular health. Yet only 25-50% of patients receive
recommended care in the year after HDPs, with further inequities by race and income. Therefore, inadequate care after
HDPs is a critical missed opportunity to promote cardiovascular health and health equity among women. Unfortunately,
efforts to improve cardiovascular health after HDPs are limited by key gaps in evidence and approach. First, there is a
general need for more data on CVD risk and cardiovascular health in diverse populations. Second, such data must be
followed rigorous implementation of evidence-based interventions that address social and structural factors, with
stakeholder engagement. In response, Dr. Murray Horwitz has developed a plan to address large knowledge gaps, work
with diverse stakeholders to adapt an evidence-based intervention and prepare for its successful implementation, and
pilot-test the intervention, to improve cardiovascular health equity after HDPs. Her 3 specific aims are to: (1) Examine the
distribution of cardiovascular health (measured by Life’s Essential 8) in a diverse nationwide sample of patients with prior
HDPs (n~40,000), then identify key care gaps along the pathway from HDPs to cardiovascular health (e.g., access to
outpatient care, CVD risk assessment), and finally identify multi-level predictors of a key point of drop-off (e.g., access to
outpatient care). These findings will inform adaptations to a postpartum patient navigation intervention, to ensure that it
addresses priority populations and modifiable barriers to cardiovascular health after HDPs. (2) Conduct stakeholder-
engaged qualitative research in 2 health care settings, to contextualize care pathways in the year after HDPs, then identify
potential implementation barriers for the planned patient navigation intervention. Findings will be used to refine the
implementation strategy for the intervention, prior to pilot testing. (3) Conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial to test the
feasibility and acceptability of a postpartum patient navigation intervention, adapted to improve cardiovascular health after
HDPs, in a large safety net hospital (n=30/group, 60 total). Trial results will inform further improvements to the intervention
and implementation strategy, to be followed by multi-site effectiveness testing. Her research aims reflect the NHLBI’s
Strategic Vision, to, “Reduce health disparities and inequities […] by leveraging epidemiology […] to understand and solve
complex health problems.” They also serve as vehicles for her training goals, as follows: (1) Develop expertise in
advanced modeling techniques, specifically multi-level modeling and risk prediction; (2) Establish competency in learning
health system science, specifically in the areas of community engagement, equity & justice, improvement &
implementation science frameworks, and research methods; and (3) Gain skills in pragmatic clinical trial design &
conduct. This award will facilitate Dr. Murray Horwitz’s long-term goal of becoming an independent investigator who
develops and disseminates interventions that improve cardiovascular health and health equity among women.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Alternative splicing (AS) of precursor mRNA provides an important means of genetic control and is a crucial
step in the expression of most genes. AS gives rise to multiple isoforms that can exhibit differential stabilities,
molecular binding capabilities, and phenotypic effects, thereby greatly expanding the functional capacity of
genes. These functions are frequently deregulated in human disease, leading to aberrantly expressed isoforms
that can act as drivers and “rewirers” of cellular pathways. Given the intrinsic role of AS in nearly every aspect
of biology, tools and technologies for the functional understanding of isoforms are desperately needed.
Unfortunately, prediction of isoform functions are notoriously difficult, due to our only crude understanding of
the molecular determinants of isoform activities as well as a paucity of experimental datasets annotated at
isoform resolution. The experiments, in turn, are challenging in their own right, due to a lack of robust methods
for the detection, mapping, and phenotyping at isoform-resolution in vivo. As a consequence, one of the
biggest gaps in the genomics and proteomics fields is an understanding the functional and evolutionary
implications of the astonishing complexity of the human proteome.
To make progress towards this gap, we must reformulate existing approaches. Here, we propose to build
computational and experimental methodologies that are intertwined across the entire development and
evaluation lifecycle. Computational approaches, capitalizing on ever-improving machine learning algorithms,
can predict the effect of AS at high coverage. Experimental validation, on the other hand, is critical to
benchmark the predictions as well as shed light on heretofore uncharacterized features of isoform functionality.
The goals of this project are to develop (i) a predictor of protein isoform stability, a “first line of evidence” and
prerequisite of isoform functionality, (ii) a novel bioinformatics approach to study the “rewiring” effects of AS
isoforms on protein interactions, and (iii) a novel measure, the alternative splicing impact factor, that predicts
the functional role of an isoform based on metrics such as the loss of interaction and expression patterns, and
apply this concept to determine AS-induced phenotypes in-silico and in vitro/vivo (cell-based assay). Each
computational stage will be closely complemented with a highly customized and novel experimental approach–
large-scale isoform proteogenomics, interactomics, and functional assays experiments–to validate and
benchmark the predictors, as well as feed into an iterative computation-experimental “virtuous cycle”.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：The corticospinal tract (CST) is a critical circuit underlying skilled voluntary movements. Damage to this circuit
during development can cause permanent, long-term movement disability in humans. Recognizing and treating
such developmental CST damage is challenging, largely because immediately after the lesion, there are limited
or almost no functional deficits. However, early recognition and intervention with the appropriate treatment
measures is key to reducing long-term disability. The use of preclinical mouse models, which have otherwise
proven to be highly useful in functional investigations of nervous system development, has been limited in this
regard. Since the CST is known to control skilled movements, established behavioral tests in mice that
investigate CST function require training mice in skilled tasks. This precludes their application in neonatal mice.
Further, mouse models used to investigate developmental CST damage, e.g. neonatal hypoxia or spinal injuries,
do not only damage the CST; rather they disrupt multiple neural pathways. It therefore remains completely
unknown whether the CST contributes only to skilled movements in adult mice, or whether it also contributes to
the development of natural, innate motor ability during development, beginning in neonatal mice. This latter
possibility would suggest that there are early, albeit subtle, behavioral correlates of developmental CST injury in
mice. We recently developed a new microsurgical approach to specifically disrupt the developing CST in
neonatal mice. In addition, we have also established the use of Motion Sequencing (MoSeq), a new machine
learning and artificial intelligence platform, to longitudinally investigate the development of natural movements
in neonatal mice. Our preliminary results using MoSeq suggest that developmental damage to the CST results
in specific changes to movement structures in mice, as early as P12; these extend into maturity at P35. Further,
analysis of these P35 mice using conventional metrics of locomotion such as the Catwalk, did not identify any
deficits, highlighting the sensitivity of MoSeq in identifying changes in mouse movements. This proposal
investigates the hypothesis that the CST controls development of natural mouse movements, and not only skilled
movements at maturity. We will use MoSeq to analyze Fezf2 knock out (Fezf2 KO) mice in which the CST is
never established during development (Aim1), as well as mice that undergo microsurgical lesions to disrupt
spinal connectivity of the CST at distinct developmental times (Aim2). Together, our work will identify novel
functional readouts of developmental damage to the CST using natural mouse movements. This new unbiased
quantitative approach toward investigating the earliest behavioral signs of corticospinal dysfunction in mice which
will have eventual application in investigations of descending circuits of motor control, as well as multiple
preclinical models of developmental damage such as neonatal hypoxia or spinal injuries.

High-risk Neuroblastoma (HRNB) is an extracranial pediatric cancer in which up to 65% of patients are
resistant to therapies. Recent biomedical advances have improved treatment options for cancer patients. Yet,
there are no effective treatment for relapsed HRNB patients who have undergone treatment and experienced
tumor recurrence. Our long-term goal is to develop more effective treatments that target relapsed HRNB.
A key feature of HRNB that drives disease progression is aberrant calcium (Ca2+) signaling. This offers
targeted therapeutic potential for Ca2+ channel inhibitors. Other groups have made progress in creating and
identifying Ca2+ channel inhibitors that may be used for cancer treatment. Our group is taking an alternative
approach by targeting Ca2+ signals that promote NB progression that are unique to relapsed HRNB. The
proposed project will leverage the elevated levels of cytosolic Ca2+ in relapsed HRNB driven by enhanced
store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) to promote mitochondrial Ca2+ overload and apoptosis. The hypothesis is
that the activation of autophagy prevents mitochondrial Ca2+ overload and apoptosis in relapsed HRNB that
otherwise might be prone to apoptosis due to the elevated SOCE. Therefore, combination treatment composed
of a novel drug 249 and an autophagy inhibitor will effectively kill relapsed HRNB.
Targeting the mitochondrial Ca2+ transporters to regulate apoptosis may offer a new therapeutic approach for
treating relapsed HRNB and a variety of cancers. A detailed understanding of mtCa2+ signaling will allow
targeting of the diseased tissue without deleterious effects on healthy tissue.
In addition, this work includes undergraduate and graduate student researchers, including those from
underrepresented minority groups. Therefore, this work will train the next generation of researchers and
increase diversity in the biomedical workforce.

This R21 proposal tests the hypothesis that environmental chemicals target microglia, the resident
immune cells in the brain and alterations in microglial function contributes to the risk of development
of neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders. Microglia play an important role in responding
to inflammation and immune challenge in the brain. They also have been shown to have a number of
important roles beyond immune response, including synaptic pruning during development and adult
neurogenesis. Microglial activation has been shown to be involved in the progression of different
neurodegenerative diseases as well as in several neuropsychiatric conditions. Accumulating evidence
suggests that environmental chemical exposure increases the susceptibility to the development of
various neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders. A majority of the studies investigating the
impacts of environmental chemical exposure on microglia have been conducted using in vitro cell
culture systems and very little is known about in vivo effects, especially during early life.
The proposed research is aimed at understanding the role of environmental chemical exposure on
microglial dysfunction in vivo in a well-established developmental model system using imaging,
molecular and behavioral approaches. It has two specific aims. In specific aim 1, we test the
hypothesis that exposure of zebrafish to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) causes microglial
activation. These studies will be conducted using a range of environmentally relevant concentrations
of PCB126, a dioxin-like PCB that is ubiquitously distributed in the environment. Using transgenic
zebrafish expressing cell-specific fluorescent markers and time-lapse confocal imaging, we will
measure microglial morphology in response to exposure. In addition, the potential effects of microglial
activation on neuronal network as well as neurobehaviors will be quantified. In specific aim 2, we will
test the hypothesis that PCB-induced microglia dysfunction is AHR dependent. Using AHR null
zebrafish, we will characterize the role of AHR in microglial activation. Wild type and AHR null
zebrafish will be exposed to a concentration of PCB126 that affected microglia and characterize the
effects both immediately after exposure and later in life. We will characterize the brain specific
transcriptional and epigenetic profiles associated with these changes using single cell RNA
sequencing and single cell DNA methylation profiling. The results from the proposed studies will
provide fundamental knowledge about the role of environmental chemicals on immune cells in the
brain.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Subcerebral projection neurons (SCPN) reside in the neocortex, and extend axons to subcerebral targets in the
brainstem and spinal cord. Corticospinal neurons (CSN), a subclass of SCPN, project to the spinal cord and their
axons form the corticospinal tract (CST), a critical circuit for voluntary motor control. In addition, projections from
the neocortex to brainstem targets function in parallel with CSN to exert motor control. Degeneration of these
projection neurons in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), along with degeneration of spinal motor neurons,
causes spasticity and paralysis. In humans, damage to the CST after spinal cord injury is a principal cause of
loss of voluntary motor control. Further, integrity of corticospinal connectivity is centrally linked to recovery from
stroke and cerebral palsy. There have been multiple investigations detailing the role of cortico-brainstem vs.
corticospinal projections in both motor control, as well as their distinct contributions to functional recovery in
these distinct causes of paralysis. However, it remains unclear when and how these distinct projections are
established during development. Understanding the molecular basis of this specification and differentiation
during development therefore holds significant promise in establishing approaches that are tailored to enhancing
plasticity of these related, yet distinct circuits. A necessary first step toward this ultimate goal is to identify the
molecular mechanisms directing SCPN axons to brainstem (cortico-brainstem neurons) versus spinal cord
(CSN). Ongoing work in our lab has identified that such projections are initially specified during the process of
axon extension during development. We have identified that cortico-brainstem and corticospinal neurons express
distinct genes and can be molecularly distinguished in mice by birth. Further our data suggest that the
transcriptional regulator Satb2 acts, in part, to specify cortico-brainstem neurons. This proposal investigates the
hypothesis that transcriptional regulation controls the development of cortico-brainstem vs. corticospinal
projections by late embryonic development in mice. Building on this foundation, we will first identify the time point
in development when these projections are specified using knock-in Cre reporter mice (Aim 1). This will be tested
using intracerebral injections of AAV-reporters at distinct developmental times in utero with adult analysis of
axonal projections. In Aim 2, we will investigate the transcriptional targets of Satb2 in SCPN at later
developmental times by profiling all SCPN in Satb2 WT and conditional KO mice, as well as by Satb2
overexpression, at single cell resolution. Finally, in Aim 3 using subpopulation-specific transgenic Cre lines, we
will investigate SCPN axon targeting in both Satb2 loss- and gain-of-function. In addition, we will investigate
whether misexpression of Satb2 target genes can alter SCPN targeting to the brainstem vs. spinal targets.
Together, our work will discern in-depth, the mechanisms of when and how transcriptional regulation controls
SCPN segmental “identity” thereby providing a mechanistic framework for subsequent identification of molecules
controlling segmentally appropriate SCPN connectivity with subcerebral targets.

Extracellular ATP and ADP are mediators of purinergic signaling in cell-to-cell communication in virtually every
tissue. Autocrine and paracrine purinergic signaling contributes to normal cellular functions such as immune cell
chemotaxis and cell volume regulation, and purinergic signaling also contributes to pathology in injury, infection,
sepsis, and a number of diseases. Notably, extracellular ATP and ADP mediate purinergic signaling between
cells with both short-term and long-term effects. However, it has been a challenge to study the cellular and
molecular mechanisms by which ATP and ADP control distinct signaling events because their levels are spatially
heterogeneous and purinergic signaling can vary significantly from cell-to-cell. Clearly, direct measurements of
extracellular nucleotides are needed, but current methods are not well adapted to measuring fluctuations in the
low extracellular nucleotide concentrations expected in live specimens. To overcome this barrier, we will use
protein engineering to develop high affinity cell-surface sensors that can be used to resolve the complex spatial
and temporal dynamics of ATP and ADP release, clearance, and purinergic receptor activation. To demonstrate
the application of our sensors and also guide their optimization, we will study neuron-glia purinergic signaling in
the brain. In particular, we will use our sensors to learn how metabolic state affects the function of microglia, the
resident immune cells in the brain, in regulating the regional purinergic dynamics that impact local neuronal
activity. The proposed series of multiplexed imaging studies that pair our purinergic sensors with sensors of
downstream signaling should directly visualize core elements of neuron-glia purinergic communication in an
integrated manner. This should provide valuable insight into novel mechanisms responsible for the coupling
between brain energy metabolism and excitability. Furthermore, the genetically-encoded tools developed
through this proposal should be broadly applicable to deeper study of any purinergic system.

High-throughput sequencing technology enables, among other things, experiments that produce
massive amounts of data about RNA transcripts in bacteria. These high-throughput sequencing
experiments continue to advance our understanding of bacterial transcriptomes, including
regulatory RNA genes, which pervade bacteria. However, processing the large resulting data
sets from high-throughput sequencing experiments can be a bottleneck in biological and
medical research studies, partly because existing methods are insufficient for analyzing these
data sets from bacteria.
 This project aims to develop new methods for processing high-throughput bacterial
sequencing data. A robust and user-friendly computational system will be implemented for end-
to-end analysis of high-throughput bacterial sequencing data. As part of this system, a novel
algorithm will be implemented to significantly reduce the time it takes for the most
computationally expensive stage of processing bacterial sequencing data, which is aligning
reads from sequencing experiments to a bacterial genome. While high-throughput bacterial
sequencing experiments commonly are performed on large sets of cells in bulk, recent
advances have made possible the effective use of these experiments on individual cells,
enabling greater resolution of bacterial transcriptome studies. New methods will be developed to
process high-throughput bacterial sequencing data from single-cell experiments. Further, a
computational system will be designed for systematic annotation of transcripts evinced from
bacterial sequencing data to aid biological and medical researchers in efficient and reliable
interpretation of the massive data sets. Finally, since many RNA genes in bacteria act as
regulators of other transcripts, novel approaches will be developed to identify the interactions
between these noncoding RNAs and their regulatory targets. The methods developed will be
applied and evaluated in different bacterial systems.

recover from opioid use disorder (OUD), but only a fraction access specialty treatment or receive an
FDA-approved medication. Community Reinforcement and Family Training (CRAFT) works with family
members to get treatment resistant individuals (Identified Persons; IPs) into treatment, and 68% of families
coached in CRAFT achieve treatment entry for their IP; about twice as many as comparison groups. However,
most addiction professionals (counselors) are not trained in CRAFT or deliver it with questionable fidelity. The
goal of this project is to develop and evaluate the technical feasibility and commercial viability of a
scalable digital counselor training program for CRAFT. The Counselor product would be tailored to
prepare counselors to work with family members of individuals with OUD. It will allow counselors to deliver
high-fidelity CRAFT and significantly benefit IPs and their families affected by OUD by addressing the critical
barrier of access to a leading evidence-based approach to family involvement in addiction recovery. Current
methods for training counselors and disseminating ESTs, including CRAFT, rely on brief online or in-person
workshops. However, research shows this format is minimally effective in facilitating adoption and
implementation of ESTs. A more efficacious model includes ongoing counselor training with feedback and
coaching. This project will develop an enhanced training model for CRAFT and digitize it to maximize
scalability. In this project, we will: Produce the digital counselor training prototype and coaching process,
tailored to OUD - with stakeholder input (Aim 1); Conduct a pilot study of 3 levels of digital training (Level 1
-Digital tutorial only [T]; Level 2 -Tutorial & digital training materials for self-study [TM]; Level 3 – Tutorial, digital
materials, feedback and coaching [TMC]) to establish feasibility, acceptability, and examine the effects of
training on CRAFT knowledge, fidelity, and treatment entry and retention (Aim 2). Validation of feasibility and
commercial merit in the Phase I pilot study will provide substantiation to advance to Phase II. In addition to
optimizing the product based on Phase I learnings and stakeholder input, Phase II goals will include
completing development of a supervised machine learning (SML) automated coding system that will score
counselor-submitted digital audiotapes of CRAFT sessions and generate written feedback including
suggestions for improvement. This will allow us to demonstrate digital training efficacy at scale and commercial
readiness (Aim 3). We will conduct a fully-powered randomized control trial comparing all piloted outcomes for
the 3 training level conditions (Aim 4). These studies form the basis to demonstrate commercial readiness and
value to purchasers.

Chronic Toxoplasma gondii infections are widespread and their reactivation can cause life-threatening disease in
immunocompromised individuals and recurrent ocular lesions in the immunocompetent. The recently identified
master regulator of chronic differentiation, BFD1, provides an unprecedented opportunity to investigate the
molecular events that establish and maintain chronic T. gondii infections. BFD1 is necessary for chronic
differentiation in cell culture and in mouse models of infection, and its expression is sufficient to induce chronic
differentiation. Consistent with a sustained requirement for BFD1 during chronic stage maintenance, the
differentiation program is reversed upon conditional down-regulation of BFD1. Preliminary results indicate that BFD1
is post-transcriptionally controlled through its 5′ UTR, leading to the hypothesis that translational regulation of BFD1
is fundamental to the development and maintenance of chronic T. gondii stages. This proposal seeks to integrate
BFD1 into a broader regulatory network through three complementary aims. Aim 1 will examine the sequence
elements, secondary RNA structures, and ribosomal occupancy dynamics that mediate BFD1 translational
regulation. Aim 2 will use conditional depletion of BFD1 to characterize transcriptional and proteomic changes that
mediate reactivation, and the molecular circuits that maintain the differentiated state. Finally, Aim 3 will extend the
regulatory pathways that control differentiation by screening for genes involved in the translational regulation of BFD1
and further examining the function of transcription factors directly regulated by BFD1. The overarching goal of this
comprehensive analysis is to understand the conditions that promote chronic differentiation and license the
development of curative therapies against toxoplasmosis.

Apicomplexan parasites include the etiologic agents of many widespread infections of humans and livestock,
such as malaria and toxoplasmosis. These diseases are caused by destruction of the host tissues in which the
parasites replicate. Because apicomplexans only replicate inside host cells, the process of invasion is critical to
their survival and pathogenesis. Invasion is mediated by the release of proteins from specialized secretory
organelles at the apical end of the parasite, the micronemes and rhoptries. Microneme proteins include
adhesins that support parasite motility and are therefore secreted as soon as parasites emerge from replication
and start migrating towards new host cells to infect. Rhoptries, by contrast, secrete their contents only upon
host cell recognition once parasites have committed to invasion. Evidence suggests that the release of rhoptry
contents depends on the prior secretion of microneme proteins; however, the molecular events that link these
two processes are unknown. Based on a genome-wide screen in the model apicomplexan Toxoplasma gondii,
our lab recently identified a conserved microneme protein necessary for invasion of human cells, which we
named CLAMP. Our preliminary studies show that CLAMP is necessary for rhoptry secretion and stably
associates with two microneme proteins: SPATR, which was previously implicated in invasion, and an
uncharacterized protein we call CLIP. We hypothesize that these interactions represent a novel invasion
complex necessary for rhoptry protein secretion. Our first aim is to compare the functions of CLAMP,
SPATR, and CLIP; investigate how they oligomerize; and elucidate the relationship between complex
formation and rhoptry secretion. In our second aim, we will identify and characterize host and parasite proteins
that interact with the CLAMP invasion complex. Finally, our third aim will take an unbiased look at the host cell
factors that stimulate rhoptry protein secretion, which may intersect with the CLAMP complex to regulate this
key step in apicomplexan invasion. Based on the conservation of the parasite proteins involved, we expect that
the principles uncovered will be generalizable to the phylum and broadly inform our understanding of these
infectious agents.

Organelles engage in homeostatic processes to improve cellular health. However, some organelle proteins in
the soma can survive many months, making them susceptible to damage during aging. In the germline, gametes
can be arrested for a prolonged period before they pass down their organelle content to the next generation.
Having damage-prone proteins perdure in the germline would therefore be problematic and challenge the ability
of germ cells to pass down healthy material from generation to generation. Upon oocyte maturation and
fertilization, certain maternal products are degraded to initiate the maternal to zygotic transition in the developing
embryo, though little is known how maternally derived organelles are turned over and replaced with zygotic
organelles. Intriguingly, quality control events have been shown to take place in single cell organisms and during
asymmetric divisions to ensure the elimination of organelle long-lived proteins (LLPs). However, whether
specialized organelle quality control takes places to remove maternally derived LLPs in developing progeny, and
how such a process would take place in a multi-cellular organism remains poorly understood. Through molecular
and genetic analysis, the research proposed in this fellowship will investigate how maternal organelle input
derived from Drosophila oocytes influences germline health of their offspring. First, I will endogenously tag well
characterized LLPs to visualize the zygotic pool of proteins along with the maternally derived long-lived pool of
the same protein across embryonic, larval and adult progeny. By differentially tagging the maternal and zygotic
pool, I will compare protein levels in the progeny germline to assess if it selectively prevents maternally deposited
organelle LLPs to be transgenerationally inherited. Next, I will perturb oocyte health to investigate how maternally
damaged LLPs contributes to offspring viability. Finally, I will identify additional long-lived proteins that are
derived from maternal organelles using a biorthogonal amino acid labeling approach and compare their fates in
the progeny germline with well characterized LLPs. The proposed experiments will highlight how maternally
derived LLPs impact organelle function in the germline of ensuing progeny. In addition, these studies will shed
light on how organelle continuity is maintained between generations and aim to reveal specialized quality control
pathways in the germline.

Mycophenolic acid (MPA) is a crucial immunosuppressive medication that prevents kidney transplant rejection
and prolongs the survival of the transplanted organ. MPA, however, is associated with dose-limiting side effects
of diarrhea and leukopenia. Recent animal studies have shown that MPA-related toxicities are dependent on the
gut microbiota, but our understanding of MPA reactivation in the gut and its contribution to associated toxicities
is incomplete. Understanding the impact of gut-mediated MPA reactivation is critical because transplant
physicians frequently encounter MPA-associated toxicities in clinical practice. Transplant physicians routinely
decrease the dosage of MPA during episodes of post-transplant diarrhea and leukopenia, but large studies have
shown that such actions are associated with acute organ rejection. Thus, it is imperative that we define the roles
played by gut bacterial beta-glucuronidase (GUS) enzymes in MPA reactivation, enterohepatic recirculation, and
associated toxicities.
The overall goals of this proposal are to identify the microbial GUS enzymes involved in reactivation of
MPA and to define the relationship between fecal GUS activity, MPA enterohepatic recirculation, and
MPA-associated toxicities in kidney transplant recipients. We hypothesize that specific microbial GUS
enzymes drive the reactivation and enterohepatic recirculation of MPA, and that quantitative fecal GUS enzyme
assays will serve as a biomarker for MPA-associated toxicities. Here we will study a cohort of 210 kidney
transplant recipients with and without MPA-associated toxicities. Our center at Weill Cornell routinely performs
approximately 250 kidney transplant recipients per year, supporting the feasibility of recruiting this number of
patients that will sufficiently power the study to successfully test our hypothesis. In Aim 1, we will define the gut
microbial GUS enzymes that reactivate MPA and the drugs that may disrupt them. In Aim 2, we will define the
relationship among quantitative fecal GUS activities, MPA enterohepatic recirculation, and MPA-associated
toxicities.
This project will reveal fundamental data about the gut microbiota's ability to reactivate MPA, influence
enterohepatic recirculation, and impact therapeutic tolerance. Importantly, it will assess fecal GUS enzyme
activity as a novel biomarker for MPA-associated toxicities, allowing for the development of more personalized
approaches to optimize MPA efficacy and minimize MPA-associated toxicities in kidney transplant recipients.

Genome-wide association studies have identified numerous genetic variants associated with type 1 and type 2
diabetes mellitus (T1DM and T2DM), many of which might affect genes that are involved in pancreatic β cell
function and survival. However, the exact biological functions and the mechanistic nature of these genetic
variants remain unclear. Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), provide, in theory, unlimited resources to
generate differentiated cells to study the role of genetic factors in human diseases. Of the diabetes-associated
genes identified so far, GLIS3 is the only one (other than insulin) associated with both T1DM and T2DM, and
neonatal diabetes mellitus (NDM). Recently, we reported an optimized strategy to efficiently derive GLIS3+
pancreatic β-like cells. Using this platform, we found that loss of GLIS3 causes impaired differentiation toward β
cells and increases β cell death.
Here, we propose to test the hypothesis that genetic and environmental factors caused loss or reduction of
GLIS3 impairs human pancreatic β cell generation, survival, and proliferation in both healthy and disease
conditions. In preliminary studies, we have created 2 isogenic T2DM-SNP-hESCs, 2 isogenic NDM-M-hESCs,
and 2 isogenic KO (knockout)-hESC lines. In addition, we identified a TGFβ inhibitor that rescues the increased
death rate in GLIS3-/- β-like cells. In this proposal, we will systematically study the differentiation of isogenic
T2DM-SNP-hESCs, NDM-M-hESCs, and GLIS3-KO-hESCs, exploring the generation, function, and survival of
the endocrine cells in the disease conditions. Additionally, we will explore the downstream mechanism of GLIS3.
Finally, we will develop approaches to improve β cell survival in T2DM conditions by targeting GLIS3 and its
downstream pathways. Toward these goals, the following aims are proposed: Aim 1. Evaluate the impact of
GLIS3-associated genetic variants in the generation and survival of human pancreatic β cells both in vitro and
in vivo. Aim 2. Decode the molecular mechanism of GLIS3 controlling human pancreatic β cell survival. Aim 3.
Rescue T2DM islets survival by targeting GLIS3 and its downstream mechanisms.
This proposal will systematically analyze the biological function of GLIS3 and associated variants in human β
cell's generation, survival, and proliferation. It will significantly enhance our knowledge of β cell biology, which
will pave the road for developing novel therapies for T2DM patients.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：SUMMARY
The textbook view of bacterial genomes shows a set of discrete genes, transcribed individually or as operons.
Transcription initiates at promoters upstream of these genes/operons, producing mostly protein-coding mRNAs
along with a smaller number of stable, functional RNAs (tRNAs, rRNAs, sRNAs). Transcription factors bind close
to promoters and regulate transcription from those promoters. Transcription terminates downstream of genes, in
3’ UTRs. This view has been the basis for decades of work on gene expression and gene regulation, with
enormous advances in our understanding of these processes. However, work from my group and others has
shown that bacterial genomes are far more complex. We will leverage my expertise in genetics, genomics, and
molecular biology, to continue productive lines of research on four overlapping topics that relate to the major
research focus of my group: the unexpected complexity of bacterial genomes. My lab has been very
productive on this topic, with 19 papers since 2016 directly relevant to the four themes described in this proposal.
Topic #1. Pervasive transcription. We and others have shown that most bacterial promoters are not in
intergenic regions, upstream of genes. Rather, they are located within genes, in sense or antisense orientations,
and are involved in “pervasive transcription”, whereby short, non-coding RNAs are transcribed before being
rapidly terminated by Rho and degraded. The majority of these RNAs are believed to be non-functional, and
suppression of pervasive transcription is required to maintain cell fitness.
Topic #2. Non-canonical transcription factor (TF) binding. We have mapped the direct and indirect regulatory
targets of hundreds of TFs across a wide range of bacterial species. Most TF binding sites are located within
genes, not intergenic regions. Moreover, most TF binding events are not associated with detectable regulation
of a nearby gene. Our data also show that in vivo binding profiles are often not well explained by a DNA sequence
motif, suggesting a role for other factors in determining the genomic sites of TF binding.
Topic #3. Widespread gene regulation by attenuation. We have shown that transcription of many Escherichia
coli genes is prematurely terminated by the conserved termination factor Rho, either in the 5’ UTR or ORF, a
process commonly referred to as “attenuation”. Attenuation has been described previously, but our data indicate
that it happens on a much larger scale than previously appreciated. We are interested in the mechanisms of
attenuation involving Rho termination, with a particular focus on the role of upstream ORFs (uORFs) that function
as cis-acting regulators, since we have identified large numbers of these ORFs in diverse bacterial species.
Topic #4. Processive antitermination. RNA polymerase can be protected from the action of the Rho
termination factor in a process known as “processive antitermination”. We will identify new regulatory targets of
known antiterminator proteins, we will determine the mechanisms of antitermination, and we will discover new
antiterminator proteins.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
 Quorum sensing (QS) is a mechanism of cell-cell communication that bacteria use to orchestrate
collective behaviors, including virulence and biofilm formation. QS relies on the production, release, and group-
wide detection of extracellular signal molecules called autoinducers (AI). QS allows bacteria to synchronously
alter gene expression patterns that underpin collective behaviors, for example, biofilm formation. Some receptors
bind and respond exclusively to one AI, while others bind and respond to multiple AIs. QS is responsible for
releasing public goods that are beneficial to kin and, potentially, non-kin, and as a result, it plays an important
role in shaping microbial community architecture. QS is now understood to be the norm in the bacterial world.
Nonetheless, how different bacterial QS receptors initiate signal transduction is not understood. Defining the
mechanisms that regulate QS-mediated production of public goods will be key for generally understanding how
organisms coordinate community level changes in gene expression. This is particularly important in light of our
findings that P. aeruginosa QS can be activated by signals produced by non-kin. Thus, determining the
mechanisms that regulate QS progression after signal recognition will allow us to understand the respective
benefits and drawbacks of strict versus relaxed ligand detection in QS-mediated communication. Bacteria live in
heterogeneous communities and encounter mixtures of AIs produced by themselves, their kin, and their non-kin
neighbors. Upon signal recognition, LasR and RhlR activate hundreds of genes, many of which are involved in
pathogenesis and biofilm formation. While some signal transduction pathways follow a linear circuit, the QS
system in P. aeruginosa is best described as a dense network of receptors and regulators with interconnecting
regulatory systems and outputs. Canonically, the LasR-AI complex activates expression of rhlR and rhlI, thus
launching the second QS system, enabling the two QS systems to function in tandem. Surprisingly, rhlR can be
upregulated in clinical isolates containing lasR inactivating mutations. RhlR can also function without its partner
synthase to regulate certain genes. This is achieved via a metallo-hydrolase known as PqsE. We discovered
that PqsE and RhlR interact to form a complex. We will explore the role of PqsE in regulating RhlR function and
describe their tandem role in transcriptional regulation and pathogenesis in AIM 1. The progression into QS
corresponds to a downregulation of certain regulatory elements that function at low cell density to potentially
mitigate early entry into QS. We have discovered that Fis, which is expressed during log phase, regulates the
production of rhlA, a gene responsible for the synthesis of rhamnolipids, which are a bacterial surfactant
important for infections. We will explore the mechanism Fis uses to achieve this regulation, in addition to what
role it might play in regulating other QS genes and behaviors in AIM 2.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：The proposed study will develop a mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) manual to address both
functional impairment and suicide risk (MBCT-S/P). We will examine the feasibility of the study design and ask
participants if the found the treatment to be acceptable. We expect this smaller study will provide critical
information for a larger trial.
 Suicide is the 10th leading cause of death. Chronic pain is a leading cause of functional impairment in the
United States and is a risk factor of suicide even after accounting for psychiatric disorders. Veterans are a
vulnerable population for both suicide and chronic pain; however, there is little research examining ways to
reduce functional impairment and suicide risk in a combined treatment. Therefore, this proposal examines the
use of MBCT as a novel way to simultaneously address functional impairment and suicide risk. Research on
patients at risk of suicide and on patients experiencing chronic pain supports the utility of MBCT separately.
However, there is limited evidence investigating a combined treatment that addresses both functional
impairment and suicide risk. Application of MBCT on veterans at risk for suicide who are experiencing
functionally-impairing chronic pain provides a unique opportunity to simultaneously address these interactive
factors.
 The overall goal of the broader program is to enhance functioning and to reduce veteran suicide, and the
proposed project will provide data to guide the development of a larger trial. The objectives of the current
proposal are to (1) combine existing MBCT intervention protocols to develop an MBCT manual aimed at
addressing the unique needs of veterans experiencing functional impairment from chronic pain who are at risk
for suicide, (2) examine if the recruitment, retention, and treatment delivery is feasible and if MBCT-S/P
acceptable to participants, and (3) assess parameters of key outcomes among participants randomized to
receive MBCT-S/P versus an Education control to inform a subsequent larger clinical trial.
 To achieve these objectives, we will develop a manual through an evidence-based, iterative process then
conduct a randomized clinical trial in Veterans with chronic pain reporting suicidal ideation. We will randomize
a total of 76 participants to receive either MBCT-S/P or Education. We will assess pain and suicide risk
outcomes such as suicidal ideation, depression, and interpersonal factors at baseline and after the treatment
period. We will also track participant flow, therapist adherence to the manual, participant homework completion

While vaccines are an integral component of disease management, vaccine technologies remain inadequate for
addressing malaria. Malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum remains a global public health concern, with
more than 229 million cases and 409,000 malaria-related deaths annually. The spread of drug-resistant parasites
and insecticide-resistant mosquitoes has exacerbated the problem of controlling malaria in many developing
countries in recent years. Current control measures such as bed nets, diagnostics, and drug treatment are
helpful, however, together with more effective vaccines that reduce infection and transmission, cases of
severe malaria may be eliminated. While an RTS,S virus-like particle vaccine targeting the sporozoite stage
of P. falciparum is available, it remains only 30% protective in children that receive the vaccine, leaving children
highly vulnerable. Versatope aims to address the unmet need for an effective malaria vaccine by
leveraging their powerful, flexible, and thermostable vaccine adjuvant platform. The power of the
technology platform is based on molecular engineering of recombinant outer membrane vesicles (rOMVs)
derived from a probiotic E. coli Nissle 1917 strain (BSL-1) engineered with a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and
reduced endotoxicity. The resulting rOMVs are nano-sized particles that not only display foreign antigens of
interest but also serve as potent adjuvants for long-term immunological memory and the induction of neutralizing
and effector antibodies that protect against lethal pathogen challenge. rOMVs are stable under refrigerated
conditions and can also be lyophilized and formulated for increased stability at room temperature, facilitating
worldwide deployment. Using this platform, Versatope aims to deliver a malaria vaccine that acts as both a pre-
erythrocytic and transmission blocking vaccine, protecting against both infection and transmission. The
anticipated result of this Direct to Phase II proposal is selection and advancement of a malaria vaccine candidate
that prevents liver-stage infection and reduces mosquito-borne-transmission. The success of Versatope’s
malaria vaccine would represent a breakthrough in malaria reduction worldwide as an improved pre-erythrocytic
vaccine(s) with substantially improved properties over the pre-erythrocytic RTS,S vaccine currently in use.
Specifically, Versatope’s malaria vaccine would feature improved efficacy, longevity of immunity, reduced
number of vaccinations, thermostability, and a lower cost of goods. The new pre-erythrocytic rOMV vaccine will
target 70% efficacy in preventing new infections in infants and children. Together with a 70% reduction in
infections provided by bed nets, this could reduce the R by a factor 10. The combined reduction in
transmission of malaria provided by the pre-erythrocytic vaccine and current control measures (bed nets,
access to health care, early diagnosis, and chemotherapeutic treatment) may not only allow global health
programs to eliminate malaria from low transmission areas but may provide the potential for global
eradication. This non-clinical development and toxicology program will advance the readiness of Versatope’s
malaria vaccine for clinical evaluation and implementation in malaria endemic regions.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
Warmer temperatures have been associated with increased virus transmission and emergence of novel
pathogens and vectors in new locations. Temperature is well documented to have a significant effect on viral
fitness and replication, which is particularly relevant in ectothermic vectors of enzootic viruses such as
mosquitoes. Temperature also impacts numerous aspects of invertebrate biology and therefore is a critical
factor influencing the transmission potential of vector populations. Studies to date which aim to model
environmental effects on population level viral dynamics assume static biological systems. Given the strong
effects of temperature on viral replication rates (and consequently evolutionary rates), the variability of vector
species and population responses to temperature, and the documented role of interactions among viral
genotype and environment in governing transmission, this assumption is flawed. This represents a clear gap in
our understanding of pathogen transmission theory and a barrier to developing accurate predictive models.
West Nile virus (WNV; Flavivirus, Flaviviridae) is the most prevalent arbovirus in the U.S. and the ideal
candidate for modeling how temperature and viral genotype interact to influence transmission and evolution of
arboviruses in dynamic vector populations. There is large variability in prevalence in mosquitoes over both fine
and broad temporal and geographic scales, and this variability has been well-documented in the U.S. Variation
in temperature and viral genotypes have also been documented over similar scales. We will utilize novel
laboratory data to refine predictions of arbovirus transmission under various evolutionary and climate
scenarios, and ultimately to create more informed predictive models that should have broader implications for
vector-borne pathogens.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Distributive Conjugal Transfer (DCT) is a unique conjugation process, first described in Mycobacterium
smegmatis, which is so robust that it emulates the genome mixing capacity of sexual reproduction:
transconjugant genomes are mosaic blends of each parent. Thus, DCT is a new paradigm of conjugation,
evolution, and horizontal gene transfer (HGT)-mediated gene flow within a bacterial gene pool. Our long-
term goals are to elucidate the mechanism of DCT and understand its role in driving mycobacterial
evolution.
We recently defined a three-gene mating identity locus (mid) as critical for donor-recipient compatibility.
Remarkably, one gene within the locus, midA, confers mycobacterial self-identity (kin). If the identical
midA gene is expressed in both donor and recipient, DCT is prevented as the cells sense kin. The focus
of this proposal is to characterize this novel form of kin recognition in mycobacteria, and to determine
how it triggers/blocks DCT. Sequence comparisons of the three mid proteins in other mycobacteria shows
that they are highly polymorphic. We hypothesize that this sequence diversity is driven by the need to
express self-identity. MidA is predicted to have a small N-terminal cytoplasmic domain and a large
extracellular C-terminal domain. We propose a model in which direct cell contact between donor and
recipient would allow the interaction of the surface exposed MidA proteins to sense kin. The N-terminal
cytoplasmic domain would trigger a transcriptional response in the recipient that either activates (non-
kin) or prevents (kin) progression to conjugation.
The two Aims are designed to characterize the mycobacterial kin recognition protein(s), determine how
mid discriminates between contacting mycobacteria, and elucidate the molecular genetic pathways
triggered by mid.
Aim1. Define and characterize the mid locus and the encoded kin functions.
Aim 2. Identify and characterize the genes responsible for kin recognition in donor and recipient strains
by transcriptional profiling wild-type and mutant strains in co-culture.
These objectives will be achieved by employing a combination of molecular genetic, genomic, and
biochemical approaches to dissect the mid locus, and transcriptional profiling of donor and recipient
strains in coculture to determine the transcriptional responses to kin recognition and DCT. Together,
these studies will elucidate the molecular basis of kin recognition in mycobacteria and provide further
mechanistic insights on this novel mechanism of HGT.

Cancer is among the leading causes of death worldwide and host-bacterial microbiota interactions
profoundly influence tumorigenesis, cancer progression and response to therapies. Nevertheless, the
role of fungi (mycobiota) in these processes remain largely unexplored, missing a potential opportunity
for developing novel diagnostic, preventative, and therapeutic strategies. Across the population,
colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer type. In addition to bacteria, we recently
described the presence of live, transcriptionally active fungi in colorectal cancers. Here, we preset
further evidence for the presence of active mycobiota in colorectal tumors and experimental data
supporting a hypothesis that fungi play an important role in colon cancer growth and response to
therapies through the interaction of fungal metabolites and virulence factors in the tumor macro- and
micro-environment. We will use novel methodologies and in vivo modeling allowing to determine fungal
species and factors that influence CRC. We will determine specific immune mediators and cells of the
immune system that interact with fungi in the tumors, and pinpoint mechanisms by which specific fungal
strains influence the tumor microenvironment and impact tumor growth. We will further characterize
fungi in tumors of patient and mice to determine the utility of the mycobiome as a predictor of cancer
progression, survival, and response to therapies. The results of these studies will contribute towards
better understanding of host-mycobiota interactions in cancer and might provide a basis for novel
diagnostic, therapeutic and co-therapeutic anticancer approaches in CRC by targeting the fungal arm
of the microbiome.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
Background: Mammalian models of cancer have been instrumental in the development of many targeted
therapies. It is, however, difficult to establish these models, such as patient-derived cell cultures (PDCC) and
xenografts (PDX). As a result, most cancer types have only a limited number of models available, which do not
accurately reflect the diversity of human cancer in real life.
Innovation: The majority of the patient-derived models were developed using untreated primary samples with
plenty of tumor tissue. The next challenge in tumor modeling will require much more difficult samples, such as
minute residual tumor foci in a patient with a partial chemotherapy response. Even though cancer is a disease
of unchecked cell growth in the body, normal cells paradoxically proliferate faster than malignant cells in cell
culture. As a result, in the majority of PDCC models, the cancer cells eventually disappear. To address the issue
of normal cell overgrowth, we are creating a tumor-specific medium (TSM) that suppresses normal cell
proliferation.
Preliminary data: As a proof-of-concept, we published twenty-five new ovarian cancer cell (OvCa) lines that
retained the molecular, histologic, and outcome features of the patient tumors.
Objectives: Our goal is to create innovative and simple culture methods that enable the creation of patient-
derived cell cultures and PDX models and develop best practices for validating these models.
Specific Aims: We are working on five major solid tumor types (lung, breast, prostate, kidney, and ovary) and
a liquid tumor (leukemia) to illustrate that our system can be adapted to culture the full spectrum of tumor types.
Aim 1: Patient-Derived Culture of Solid Tumors: We will establish patient-derived lung, breast, prostate,
kidney, and ovary adenocarcinoma cultures and compare their molecular profiles with the original patient tumor.
Aim 2) Patient-Derived Culture of Solid Tumors: We will establish patient-derived AML cultures and compare
their molecular and phenotypic profiles with the original patient tumor.
Research Strategy: We will compare the genome, transcriptome, and proteome of each cell line with the original
patient tumor, existing cell lines, and tumor datasets.
Innovation: By suppressing the expansion of normal stromal cells and normal epithelium, the TSM culture
system can maintain cancer cell lines long-term without feeder layers, drugs, or extracts.
Impact: Predicting drug activity in the clinic has always been difficult using traditional cultural models. Therefore,
having access to biologically relevant lung, breast, prostate, kidney, ovary, and AML cell lines could revolutionize
cancer drug development.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
Telomeres are specialized protein-DNA structures that protect the ends of linear chromosomes and
maintain genomic stability. Maintenance of adequate telomere length is thus essential for cellular
immortalization and tumorigenesis. While most human cancers achieve this through telomerase
activation, ~ 5% - 10% of them adopt a recombination-based mechanism termed alternative lengthening
of telomeres (ALT) to elongate their telomeres. Although the ALT-driven cancers are generally aggressive
with poor prognosis, there are currently no targeted therapies. In human cancers, ALT is strongly
associated with genetic alterations that affect histone H3.3 chaperone ATRX-DAXX complex. We and
others previously demonstrated that the ATRX-DAXX complex is essential for normal telomere
maintenance. We showed that ATRX or DAXX loss, while promoting tumorigenesis by potentiating the
ALT-driven immortalization, also creates a persistent telomere replication dysfunction. We therefore
hypothesize that ALT-immortalized cancers must have adopted special mechanism(s) to offset their
innate telomere DNA replication defects, and thus would be selectively vulnerable to the inhibition of
those compensatory pathways. By combining our unique isogenic ALT-immortalization model system
and customized domain-focused CRISPR screen platform, we have uncovered a list of selective
molecular vulnerabilities including histone lysine demethylase KDM2A for ALT-dependent cells. We
demonstrate that KDM2A-mediated H3K36me2 demethylation is required for ALT-directed telomere
maintenance. Inactivation of KDM2A impairs ALT-specific multitelomere cluster dissolution, leading to
chromosome missegregation and mitotic cell death. The objectives of this proposal are to delineate the
molecular mechanism underlying ALT-directed telomere maintenance and to identify mechanism-based
therapeutic targets against ALT-driven human cancers. To meet those goals, we will pursue the following
three specific aims. In Aim 1, we will investigate the molecular functions of KDM2A in ALT-directed
telomere maintenance. In Aim 2, we will define the potential adverse effects and off-tumor toxicities of
future KDM2A-targeted therapies. In Aim 3, we will establish an in vivo platform to explore the synthetic-
lethal interactions of ALT-driven ATRX-mutant malignant gliomas. Completion of the proposed studies
will uncover the molecular mechanisms and critical dependencies underlying ALT-directed telomere
maintenance and thus drive the development of novel mechanism-based therapeutics against ALT-
dependent cancers including the ATRX mutant malignant gliomas.

Proteasome inhibitor (PI) drugs turned untreatable multiple myeloma treatable, significantly improve the
quality of life for multiple myeloma patients. There are three FDA-approved PI drugs. In additional to
multiple myeloma (MM), PI drugs are also approved to treat mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), amyloid light
chain (AL) amyloidosis and Waldenström macroglobulinemia, the latter two are noncurable rare
disorders related to plasma cells. Nevertheless, resistance inevitably occurs. All three drugs have
serious toxicities. A high percentage of patients suffer from neuropathy, a debilitating adverse effect
from two peptide boronate based PI drugs, bortezomib and ixazomib. Another PI drug carfilzomib also
has cardiovascular and renal toxicity. Notably, none of the PI drugs showed little clinical benefits in
treating patients with solid tumors in numerous clinical trials. Studies have shown that upon treatment
with PIs, a transcription factor NRF1 will be activated to express more proteasomes that renders PI
drugs less or non-effective. Recent studies show that when chymotryptic β5 and tryptic β2 of the
proteasomes are simultaneously inhibited, NRF1, instead of activation, forms aggregated, disarming the
ability of tumor cells to resist apoptotic stress induced from proteasome inhibition. Because of the
striking difference between the “chymotryptic” proteolytic preference of β5 to cleave after hydrophobic
residues and the “tryptic” preference of β2 to cleave after basic residues, it is challenging to develop
inhibitors that can target both β2 and β5 with similar potency. Besides, such β5β2 targeting inhibitors
would also have to spare the “acidic” β1 active subunit to avoid nonspecific cytotoxicity. No such
inhibitors have been reported in peptide boronate and peptide epoxyketone classes. There are three
known β5β2-inhibitors in other classes, all of them irreversible, carrying unpredictable toxicities. We
have now designed and characterized a group of macrocyclic peptide boronates that simultaneously
inhibit β5 and β2, but not β1. These compounds elicit markedly less NRF1 activation in triple negative
breast cancer cells (TNBC) than BTZ. We now aim to continue our team approach to advance the
structure-guided development of β5β2 inhibitors for cancer treatment by improving their specificity and
pharmaceutical properties and evaluate their in vitro anticancer activity and in vivo efficacy in animal
models of TNBC. In Aim 1 of this proposal, we will conduct structure-guided lead optimization to improve
β5β2-inhibitors’ potency, specificity and pharmacokinetic properties. In Aim 2, we will test β5β2-
inhibitors' cytotoxicity against breast cancer line cells. Aim 3 will test the efficacy of β5β2-inhibitors in in
animal models of TNBC.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is the third leading cause of death worldwide at 3.23 million
(2019), while nearly 400 million suffer its effects. COPD is a heterogeneous, multi-phenotypic disease with lung
damage derived from smoking, vaping, cooking, forest fires, pollution, chemical exposure, and numerous
occupational hazards (e.g., 1st responders, military, agricultural and industrial workers). The most common form
of COPD is chronic bronchitis, which is associated with mucus hypersecretion that results in greatly reduced
lung function leading to a decreased quality of life.
Current treatments for COPD largely treat symptoms without meaningfully altering the course of the disease.
There are currently no truly disease-modifying treatments available for COPD patients. Different families
of proteases have been implicated in COPD. Recently, a specific protease has been shown to be upregulated
in lung epithelial cells and macrophages, and its expression in these cells correlates directly with disease severity
in human COPD patients. The target is a pleiotropic membrane bound protein that processes cytokines, growth
factors, receptors, and receptor ligands on the cell surface. Verra Therapeutics has developed a soluble protein
inhibitor, VTH245, that selectively inhibits the proteolytic activity and blocks deleterious activities in models of
COPD. This innovative protein inhibitor has significant advantages in specificity (compared to small molecule
inhibitors), penetration (smaller than monoclonal antibodies), and immunogenicity (based on a naturally
occurring protein sequence). Data generated in our Phase I project have demonstrated that VTH245 treatment
in a gold-standard mouse model of cigarette smoke-induced COPD 1) significantly reduced biomarkers of lung
inflammation and destruction; 2) reduced inflammatory cell counts in the lung lavage to near-air levels; and 3)
reduced mucus hypersecretion. Further, these results matched or exceeded performance of the marketed drug,
roflumilast. While roflumilast treatment is commonly associated with a range of toxicities that limit its use, VTH245
was well tolerated and displayed the highest survival rate over 6-months (20/20 animals). This Phase II SBIR
project will extend our findings from Phase I and provide key IND-enabling safety data to inform future first-in-
human studies through the execution of the following Specific Aims: Aim 1: To identify the preferred route of
administration for VTH245 for treating COPD by comparing the efficacy provided by two clinically relevant
routes of administration, subcutaneous and inhaled, determining a single route for use in toxicity studies in Aim
3; Aim 2: To perform critical CMC activities for VTH245 process development and generate high quality
VT245 for use in toxicity evaluations in Aim 3; and Aim 3: To generate a preliminary safety profile of VTH245
to support IND approval. Successful completion of the Phase II program will further define the target product
profile for VTH245 and provide critical data for an IND submission to support a clinical development program.

Eradicating HIV from infected individuals is obstructed by the formation of a reservoir of persistent infected cells;
eliminating this reservoir could allow a cure for HIV infection. Recent research provides clues to approaches for
reservoir eradication. Rare, infected individuals, termed elite controllers (EC), control HIV without treatment with
antiretroviral medications. Analysis of HIV reservoirs in these individuals supports a model in which most
efficiently expressed HIV proviruses have been eliminated. Thus, integration sites of proviruses from ECs are
found enriched in genomic regions associated with heterochromatin and transcriptional repression. This overall
pattern is, however, violated by some clonally expanded infected cells with genic integrations that show ongoing
viral transcription. It has been suggested that these clones may have pro-survival and/or immune resistance
characteristics, but this remains poorly understood. Our team has shown that the above features can be
recapitulated by the application of CD8+ T-cell pressure in a novel mouse model of long-term infection, termed
the Participant Derived Xenograft (PDX) model. For this, T-cells are obtained from ECs and separated into
fractions. Naïve T cells are removed, which eliminates graft-versus-host disease upon transplantation into mice.
CD4+ memory T cells are transplanted into immunodeficient mice, then HIV is introduced. Autologous CD8+ T-
cells are introduced or not in controls, allowing experimental assessment of CD8+ T-cell pressure. In preliminary
data, in the presence of CD8+ T-cells, the selected proviral population is smaller and viral loads lower. Advanced
sequencing of integration site distributions shows larger clone sizes in the presence of CD8+ T-cell pressure,
and multiple features paralleling results in ECs, such as favored integration outside transcription units, integration
in reverse orientation relative to host transcription, and favored integration in more heterochromatic nuclear
compartments to name a few. Thus, we propose to use the PDX model, advanced integration site analysis, and
further tools to address the following Specific Aims: Aim 1. To define in high resolution the integration site
features that enable the persistence of HIV proviruses under extended in vivo selection by CD8+ T-cells and
compare the effects of diverse approach to enhancing this pressure. We will test multiple interventions in the
PDX model to increase CD8+ T-cell pressure, reverse latency or block its establishment, and characterize in
detail the molecular correlates. Aim 2. To train and validate multivariate statistical models to quantify the degree
of CD8+ T-cell selection on a given pro-viral landscape and use the models to infer selection in interventional
clinical trials. Completion of this study will thus provide advanced tools for quantifying CD8+ T-cell pressure on
populations of integrated HIV proviruses, rich information on the functions of latency and immune modulators in
the PDX model and in human trials, and an evaluation of the novel hypothesis that HIV insertional mutagenesis
can confer resistance to CD8+ T-cell-mediated killing.

 The human intestinal tract supports a complex microbial environment consisting of bacterial (or
microbiota) and fungal (or mycobiota) constituents. Although the role of each of these communities has been a
subject of multiple studies, the role of transkingdom interactions between fungi and bacteria in shaping host
immunity and physiology has been much less explored. The chemical basis for such interactions, critical for the
rational design of mechanistic studies with regards to host immunity and disease development, remain
completely uncharted territory in the literature. We have established a genetic manipulation pipeline to identify
gene transfer methodology and build a genetic tool for nonmodel human gut bacteria on a large scale. Via a
multifactorial optimization of their conjugation/transformation conditions and targeting bacterial conserved 16s
rRNA genes, this pipeline efficiently identified the gene transfer methods for multiple nonmodel gut bacterial
commensals and set up CRISPR-based or gene insertion tools in multiple of them. This library of genetically
targetable microbes comes from 5 different phyla. This genetic manipulation pipeline and this library of tractable
commensals will facilitate our investigation of trans-kingdom microbiota-mycobiota interactions at the molecular
level. A high throughput screening of bacterial metabolite libraries from gut bacteria identified metabolites with
direct effect on intestinal mycobiota. We identified bacterial species and corresponding gene clusters responsible
for the production of these metabolites. Our preliminary data suggest strong ties and specific molecular
interactions between fungi and bacteria in the gut that have previously unappreciated role in microbial dynamics,
metabolite production and immunity. We will utilize such bacterial strains and isogenic mutants in key
biosynthetic pathways to target metabolites with mycobiota modulatory properties. We will use several mouse
models and synthetic microbial communities to define the role of trans kingdom interaction between bacteria and
fungi in modulating host immunity and colonization resistance in the gut. We hypothesize that metabolites from
the human bacterial microbiota modulate the fungal communities in the gut to affect microbial composition, the
microbiome function and immunity. In addition to revealing novel mechanisms of fungal-bacterial interaction at
an unprecedented small molecule level, the results of this proposed investigation will illuminate potential new
strategies for targeting of fungal pathogens

Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is the second most common adult muscular dystrophy in the
world with a global prevalence of ~4:100,000. Clinically, patients with FSHD experience progressive
weakness, muscle wasting, and varied symptomatic burden. As adult patients with FSHD age, they frequently
develop difficulty walking or lose the ability to ambulate due to profound weakness and muscle atrophy.
Currently, there are no therapies that have been demonstrated to reverse or even slow the progressive
symptoms associated with FSHD. A treatment that limits disease progression and/or reverses functional
decline would be beneficial to this population. In 2022, we successfully completed a single center (University
of Rochester), single-arm, proof-of-concept study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of daily rHGH
(Genotropin®) combined with testosterone enanthate injections every 2 weeks in men with FSHD. Participants
received study drugs for 24 weeks followed by a 12-week washout period. Participants received serial safety
testing, laboratory testing, functional assessments, and disease burden monitoring during the study with no
participants experiencing a serious adverse event. After 24 weeks, the six-minute walk distance increased by
37.3 meters (p=0.001), lean body mass improved by 2.2 kg (p<0.0001), body fat reduced by 1.3 kg (p=0.044),
overall strength (standardized QMT, average % of predicted normal) increased by 3% (p=0.033), clinical
function (FSHD-COM) improved by 12% (2.4 points; p=0.006), and total disease burden (FSHD-HI) reduced by
19% (6 points; p=0.043) from baseline. While this approach generated one of the largest gains of function in
response to a therapy in FSHD, a larger placebo-controlled efficacy study is needed to further validate these
results. The proposed one-year planning award allows for the completion of all of the preliminary steps
needed to successfully initiate and eventually conduct such a study. Planning award activities will include but
will not be limited to: 1) finalizing the study protocol, statistical analysis plan, data and safety monitoring plan,
and all required study materials; 2) securing pharmaceutical contracts for study drugs; 3) identifying and
securing partnerships with external collaborators and clinical sites; 3) initiating the IRB approval process; and,
4) applying for a NIAMS U01 clinical trial award to support the implementation and conduct of a multicenter
phase 3 study. Ultimately, this phase 3 study will evaluate an extremely promising therapeutic approach for
improving ambulation, strength, lean body mass, and symptomatic burden in a well-defined cohort of patients
with FSHD and will pave the way for FDA approval of a potentially life-improving therapy for patients with this
muscular dystrophy.

For terrestrial mammals, social interaction is heavily reliant on chemosensory information processed by the
accessory olfactory system (AOS), which is specialized for detecting non-volatile odorants, such as kairomones
(interspecific social cues) and pheromones (conspecific social cues). In the AOS, the initial processing of
chemosensory information takes place in the vomeronasal organ (VNO), where natural AOS ligands activate
vomeronasal sensory neurons (VSNs) through the expression of vomeronasal receptors (VRs). Despite
extensive research, many unknowns exist regarding the natural AOS ligand-receptor pairs, elicited behavior,
and the downstream neural circuitries. My preliminary data revealed that various types of molecules, such as
bile acids, dipeptides, and fatty acids, had distinct levels of abundance in the feces of mouse-fed snakes
compared with those from insect-fed lizards and salad-fed turtles. In addition, the AOS was selectively activated
by fecal extracts from reptiles fed different diets. To explore how mice respond to snake fecal chemosignals, I
developed a layered, hybrid machine learning (ML)-based behavior analysis workflow. This workflow revealed
that snake feces increased risk assessment behaviors in mice that were distinct from other threatening odors,
such as 2,4,5-Trimethylthiazole (TMT). Based on these preliminary data and analytic tools, this proposal seeks
to identify the chemosensory mechanism and associated behaviors elicited by threatening chemosignals from
the snake, a known mouse predator. To do this, I will use liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) to
determine the natural fecal ligands that activate VSNs. Then, I will implement volumetric VNO Ca2+ imaging via
objective-coupled planar illumination (OCPI) microscopy to identify responsive VSN populations to natural fecal
ligands. I will also leverage novel ML-based analytic workflow to comprehensively quantify mouse behavior from
2D/3D video monitoring as animals respond to fecal chemosignals from predatory species. Furthermore, I will
employ whole-brain serial two-photon tomography (STPT) imaging to determine brain-wide activity patterns
elicited by threatening predatory chemosignals. Collectively, this proposal will significantly advance the field by
(1) identifying new kairomone ligands, (2) broadening the range of analytical techniques for studying
chemosensory behavior, and (3) deepening our understanding of chemosensory information processing along
the behaviorally relevant AOS pathway. The successful completion of the proposed experiments will provide a
strong foundation for a R01 grant, including uncovering AOS ligand-receptor interactions at the single-cell level
(Aim 1), examining associated behaviors in high resolution (Aim 2), and exploring the activity patterns triggered
on a brain-wide scale (Aim 3).

 Wnt signaling is an evolutionarily conserved pathway that regulates several cellular behaviors such as
cell proliferation, survival, differentiation, and migration to promote tissue homeostasis. Of note, the Wg/Wnt
signaling pathway is important for tissue patterning and is often deregulated in epithelial cancers. Secreted Wnt
ligands are distributed in the extracellular space to promote paracrine and long-range signaling in target cells.
These paracrine and long-range functions of Wnts are dependent on extracellular Wnt availability, which in part
is dictated by cell-surface glypican, Dally-like protein (Dlp). In this proposal, I will focus on molecular mechanisms
that dictate Dlp-mediated regulation of Wnt availability and signaling.
 Dlp’s role in regulating Wnt signaling has been described as ‘biphasic’: By continual binding and release,
Dlp simultaneously promotes long-range signaling and restricts paracrine signaling, ensuring proper ligand
availability at both ranges. The Page-McCaw lab established Drosophila germarium, a tissue where oogenesis
occurs, as a model to study mechanisms that define Wnt signaling ranges, and identified a novel Dlp/Mmp2
(Matrix Metalloprotease 2) module that modulates paracrine and long-range Wnt signaling in the germarium.
Specifically, I found that proteolytic cleavage of Dlp by Mmp2 alters its subcellular localization and function to
modulate Wnt availability. Additionally, my preliminary data suggest that Dlp/Mmp2 may regulate Wnt signaling
in epithelial tumors to promote tumor growth. In Aim 1, I will investigate the molecular events that occur
downstream of proteolytic cleavage of Dlp to modulate Wg/Wnt availability and signaling in the germarium and
tumors.
 The extracellular Wnt distribution is tightly linked with its production and secretion. I found that Dlp can
modulate Wg (Wnt-1) production in source cells in the germarium. Wg production in source cells in germaria is
tightly regulated and this regulation is crucial for proper oogenesis. Additionally, I found that Dlp interacts with
non-ligand proteins (a finding that has not been previously reported) that communicate with intracellular
cytoskeletal machinery, potentially to modulate cell adhesion and/or shape. In Aim 2, I will investigate novel
mechanisms of how Dlp regulates Wnt ligand production and long-range Wg distribution to facilitate long-range
Wg signaling. These investigations will uncover previously unappreciated roles of cell-surface glypicans in
regulating Wnt signaling and elucidate novel paradigms of developmental strategies employed in multicellular
organisms to maintain tissue homeostasis.

Doxorubicin is routinely prescribed in treatment of various cancers because of its extremely high efficacy.
However, its use is severely limited because of its potential to cause irreversible cardiotoxicity. Since cessation
of therapy is not viable in cancer patients, there is a need to explore the molecular mechanisms underlying
cardiotoxicity to accurately identify risk factors as well as therapeutic targets for effective adjuncts. The primary
mechanism by which doxorubicin exerts its cardiotoxic effects is due to preferential accumulation of excess iron
in cardiac mitochondria, which generates cytotoxic free radicals, and disruption of cellular and subcellular iron
utilization. Thus, chelating excess mitochondrial iron can prevent doxorubicin-induced cardiac dysfunction.
Indeed, the only drug approved to treat doxorubicin cardiomyopathy, dexrazoxane, has demonstrated
mitochondrial chelation potential. However, dexrazoxane alters topoisomerases, the enzymes responsible for
DNA replication and doxorubicin’s pharmacological target, which thereby impairs doxorubicin’s anticancer
activity. In addition, dexrazoxane has potential to induce fatal myelosuppression and acute leukemias, which
consequently limit its clinical utility. Cancer survivors who subsequently develop cardiomyopathies have the
worst survivals among all cardiomyopathies, and timely intervention results in a superior clinical outcome in those
survivors treated with cardiotoxic chemotherapy. Thus, there is a major unmet need for mitochondria-specific
iron chelators that do not impede doxorubicin’s antitumor activity. Earlier we have demonstrated that hinokitiol,
a small molecule with high iron binding affinity and cell permeability, corrects abnormal iron buildup across the
membrane caused by genetic deficiency in mitochondrial iron transporters. These findings prompted us to
question if hinokitiol could rescue doxorubicin-induced mitochondrial accumulation of iron. Our pilot study has
indicated a feasibility that hinokitiol corrects mitochondrial iron overload and improves survival in cardiac cells
treated with doxorubicin with no influence on tumor-killing effect of doxorubicin. Thus, we hypothesize that
hinokitiol mobilizes excess iron from the cardiac mitochondria and prevents oxidative damage, thereby reversing
doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy, while preserving doxorubicin’s anticancer activity. The specific aims are
to determine: i) mitochondrial iron export after hinokitiol administration, ii) the cardioprotective effect of hinokitiol
on doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity, and iii) the effect of hinokitiol on the antineoplastic efficacy of doxorubicin
using tumor-bearing mice. Our studies will provide a new therapeutic strategy to reverse abnormal accumulation
of mitochondrial iron and correct doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity without compromising its antineoplastic
effects. If successful, this drug can be safely co-administered with doxorubicin as a rescue factor to improve the
therapeutic index of doxorubicin along with better clinical outcome.
