Tuberculosis (TB) is a global health crisis. As the second leading cause of death due to infectious disease, it
claims roughly 1.5 million lives a year. Although TB can be treated, the curative regimen is complicated and
takes several months. Drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), including totally drug-resistant strains,
is steadily increasing in prevalence. Therefore, novel therapeutics with the potential to decrease treatment
duration and increase barriers to resistance are essential for disease eradication. Most TB drug discovery
programs have taken target-based approaches and largely ignored intrabacterial metabolism. However, several
first- and second- line antituberculars penetrate Mtb as prodrugs and are intrabacterially metabolized into their
active form. When faced with the markedly lipid-rich, hydrophobic environment of the Mtb cell envelope, prodrugs
have the ability to enter the cell and subsequently release more polar, Mtb-active moieties within the bacterium.
Most Mtb prodrugs are activated by non-essential enzymes, and, as a consequence, resistance develops
quickly. For example, pyrazinamide (PZA), a key first-line antitubercular that enables a shortened TB drug
regimen, is activated to pyrazinoic acid (POA) by the non-essential amidase PncA, and the vast majority of PZA
resistance is caused by mutations in this activating gene. Notably, several other Mtb amidases have also been
shown to metabolize amide antituberculars, thereby activating prodrugs and inactivating active drug compounds.
We hypothesize that we can harness Mtb amidases to design and activate amide prodrugs within Mtb that are
active in drug-resistant disease and that have increased barriers to resistance. Our proposal aims to 1) study
the amide-amidase interactions to identify amide prodrugs that are activated by more than one amidase and 2)
link POA to amine metabolites from parent compounds that demonstrate amide hydrolysis within Mtb to generate
potential POA-releasing conjugates that are activated by non-PncA amidases. The majority of amidases are
non-essential and likely have overlapping functions, enabling the discovery of amide-containing antituberculars
that are activated by multiple amidases. Furthermore, the release of POA by amidases other than PncA would
retain PZA-like activity in PZA-resistant strains, restoring the activity of a first-line antitubercular critical for shorter
TB regimens. This approach will introduce a novel framework for TB prodrug discovery that can be applied to
other classes of small molecules and their activating enzymes. In all, the proposed project and training plan will
greatly further my development as a researcher and independent scientific thinker by introducing me to new
scientific concepts and techniques and providing ample opportunity for me the integrate my research and clinical
experiences. Together, Rutgers New Jersey Medical School, the Public Health Research Institute, and the
Global TB Institute create a highly collaborative and highly translational environment that uniquely benefit my
training as an infectious disease physician-scientist.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：PROJECT SUMMARY
Powassan virus (family Flaviviridae) is a reemerging tickborne virus endemic in North America and Russia. In
1997, a POWV-like agent was isolated from Ixodes scapularis in New England and determined to be genetically
distinct from the original human isolate. This revealed the existence of two lineages: lineage I, POWV (POWV
L1) and lineage II, deer tick virus (POWV L2). POWV L1 is maintained between I. cookei and woodchucks and
I. marxi and arboreal squirrels, while POWV L2 is maintained in I. scapularis and small mammalian hosts. This
distinction suggests an evolutionary progression of either POWV L1 or L2 into unique transmission cycles and
subsequent adaption to these new hosts. Tick, mammalian, and human isolates from New York State (NYS) are
typically identified as POWV L2, but for the first time in 45 years three POWV L1 isolates were detected including
isolations from I. cookei and the first known isolation of POWV L1 from I. scapularis. Additionally, within the same
timeframe in NYS, POWV L1 was identified in Dermacentor variabilis and POWV L2 in Amblyomma
americanum. With few available isolates, especially POWV L1, little work has been done to elucidate genetic
correlates that confer tick host specificity or the role of tick host responses in driving host-specific adaptation.
Therefore, the goal of this study is to utilize our emergent POWV isolates to understand genetic
correlates of tick host specificity and to investigate the potential for further adaptation to distinct tick
hosts. My previous work suggests introduction of POWV L1 into new tick hosts like I. scapularis facilitates viral
diversification and emergence of host-driven adaptations in proteins involved in immune evasion and replication.
Therefore, I hypothesize introduction of POWV L1 into distinct tick species leads to emergence of tick-specific
substitutions that contribute to increased viral fitness. Additionally, I hypothesize these changes will be tick
specific with distinct adaptation of POWV occurring dependent on tick species. To test this, I propose to:
AIM 1: Investigate the role of tick-driven, emergent substitutions in NS4b on viral fitness using a novel
POWV L1 infectious clone
AIM 2: perform experimental evolution of POWV in distinct tick species: Ixodes scapularis, Dermacentor
variabilis, and Amblyomma americanum to assess changes in viral diversity and describe tick antiviral
responses to POWV
These studies will help further our understanding of POWV adaptation to novel hosts and host-specific, genetic
correlates that influence viral fitness. Additionally, these studies will contribute to the poorly understood tick
antiviral responses to POWV infection. Overall, this work may act as a model for tickborne virus spread and
establishment in new transmission cycles.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：COVID-19 has resulted in a significant burden on the human population following the emergence of SARS-
CoV-2. Since the discovery of SARS-CoV-2 in 2019, millions have succumbed to infection due to an imbalanced
host response orchestrated by the biology of the virus. Characterization of the interactions between SARS-CoV-
2 and the infected host have revealed that the virus manipulates a small subset of signaling pathways culminating
in an overproduction of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines juxtaposed to an underproduction of type I
interferons, the central antiviral defense of vertebrates. An effort to identify kinase drug targets for the treatment
of COVID-19, as kinases represent ideal druggable targets, found that the p38 family of mitogen-activated protein
kinases (MAPKs) are among the most highly active kinases during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover,
perturbation of p38 kinases inhibited both virus replication and cytokine production. Thus, p38 kinases are
promising drug targets to block both virus replication and the excessive inflammation that is a hallmark of severe
COVID-19.
 In a subsequent study, a genetic perturbation approach was used to explore the p38/MAPK-SARS-CoV-2
interface and it was determined that the β isoform of the p38 kinase is an essential host factor for virus replication.
Additionally, inhibition of p38β reduces the abundance of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (N), but not viral
mRNA during infection. Contrary to the assumed pro-inflammatory activity of p38 kinases, findings suggested
p38β negatively regulates the expression of inflammatory cytokines. Lastly, p38-dependent phosphosites on
SARS-CoV-2 N were identified and mutation of these sites resulted in attenuated virus replication. Based on
these data, the overarching goal of the research proposed here is to test the hypothesize that p38β
phosphorylates both viral and host proteins to cumulatively promote SARS-CoV-2 replication and
modulate the host response.
 To further characterize the SARS-CoV-2-p38β interface, Aim 1 will explore the mechanism(s) responsible
for p38β's proviral activity and ascertain the contribution of this biology to the inflammatory response observed
in the context of COVID-19. To this end, viral protein stability will be assessed with translation inhibitors and
affinity-purification mass spectrometry to establish how p38β promotes the steady-state level of viral protein
during infection. In parallel, different immune agonists and genetic perturbations will be tested in Aim 2 to assess
the specificity of p38β-mediated downregulation of inflammatory cytokines and determine if altered expression
of these cytokines contributes to the proviral activity of p38β.
 By characterizing these p38β-SARS-CoV-2 interactions, the research proposed here will enhance the
understanding of SARS-CoV-2 biology, virus-host interactions, and p38β biology in order to inform the
development of novel drug therapies critically needed for the treatment of COVID-19.

promotes aberrant cell proliferation, tissue overgrowth and tumor development. Elucidating how the mTOR and
Hippo signaling pathways coordinate their activities is therefore a vitally important, yet poorly understood, area
of cell cancer biology. Our lab previously demonstrated that STK25, a serine/threonine kinase, functions as an
upstream activator of Hippo signaling to limit cell growth. Using unbiased approaches, we have now generated
strong preliminary data suggesting that the STK25 kinase also functions to impair mTORC1 signaling. We have
found that that genetic depletion of STK25 leads to both mTORC1 pathway activation and Hippo pathway
inactivation. These data suggest that STK25 may play a critical role in regulating cell proliferation and tumor
suppression by coordinating the activities of both the mTORC1 and Hippo signaling pathways. However, the
mechanism by which STK25 regulates mTORC1 is unknown. In this proposal, we hypothesize that STK25
directly regulates and phosphorylates key regulatory components of the mTORC1 signaling pathway, ultimately
attenuating mTOR signaling. Further, our preliminary studies of STK25 knockout in mice demonstrate that
conditional depletion of STK25 is sufficient to induce tumorigenesis, which is congruent with bioinformatic
evidence that STK25 is significantly focally deleted in a variety of human cancers. Combining this with our in
vitro findings, we also hypothesize that STK25 deficient tumors are dependent on YAP/TAZ and/or mTORC1
activity for growth and survival. These hypotheses will be tested in two specific aims. In Aim 1, we will use cell
biological and biochemical approaches to mechanistically define the role of STK25 kinase in regulating mTORC1
activity by characterizing its direct phosphorylated substrates. In Aim 2, we will use a conditional STK25 knockout
mouse that we have already generated to determine if STK25 loss facilitates tumorigenesis through increased
YAP/TAZ and/or mTORC1 activity. Successful completion of these aims will advance our understanding of
mTORC1 and Hippo signaling, and reveal significant new insights into the underlying mechanisms driving tumor
development. Moreover, the proposed training plan will greatly enhance my repertoire of skills in microscopy and
imaging techniques, molecular cell biology, mouse cancer studies and liquid chromatography mass spectrometry
(LC-MS/MS) analysis. Altogether, this will facilitate the development of my scientific expertise in the fields of
mTOR and Hippo signaling in cancer biology required for success as an independent scientist.

 Reading comprehension is supported by a hierarchy of cognitive-linguistic processes such as
recognizing words, mapping semantics onto words and phrases, and integrating information across units. In
bilingual individuals, successful reading comprehension must also include some mechanism of language
selection to enable reading in the target language given that both languages are active during linguistic
processing. Due to stroke, bilinguals with aphasia (BWA) routinely demonstrate impairments in reading
comprehension and language selection—in addition to other cognitive-linguistic deficits—which may severely
compromise their ability to access and select appropriate lexical representations in one or both languages
while reading. Previous studies in healthy bilinguals have used eye-tracking-while-reading to determine the
effect of contextual information on real-time sentence comprehension; however, it is currently unknown
whether BWA are sensitive to the same types of information or whether they demonstrate similar patterns of
language co-activation post-stroke.
 The overall goal of this proposal is to address this gap in the literature through a series of eye-tracking-
while-reading experiments to measure the effects of semantic and lexical variables on real-time sentence
processing in BWA. Eye-tracking-while-reading designs are ideal for examining real-time reading because they
permit subjects to i) view all words in a sentence throughout the trial (i.e., without pressing a button to uncover
them) and ii) return to earlier words or phrases for rereading which is especially important for BWA who will
require more time to retrieve lexical representations and process the meaning of a sentence. In the current
proposal, Aim 1 will examine the effects of reading cognates, which share overlapping orthographic and
semantic representations (e.g., piano in English and Spanish), and semantically constrained sentences on
real-time sentence processing. Aim 2 will examine the effects of reading interlingual homograph words, which
overlap in orthography but diverge in meaning (e.g., fin, animal part in English, end in Spanish), and
semantically constrained sentences on real-time sentence processing. Aim 3 will examine the relationship
between eye tracking outcomes and offline measures of language proficiency, linguistic impairment, and
nonlinguistic cognition to investigate the effects of individual variability in BWA reading behaviors post-stroke.
 By achieving these aims, this project will advance our understanding of reading comprehension
impairment in BWA. Ultimately, such findings can be used to enhance clinical outcomes for this population and
will represent an important first step in improving quality of life and access to literacy post-stroke.

Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a poorly understood cutaneous malignancy with viral etiology. Most MCC tumors
feature monoclonal integration of Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCV), which expresses viral T-Antigens (T-Ags).
Small T-antigen (sT-Ag) acts as a transcriptional co-regulator, while Large T (LT-Ag) principally functions to
sequester retinoblastoma protein (RB1) to de-regulate the cell cycle. The T-Ags are responsible for driving
tumorigenesis in T-Ag expressing (T-Ag+) MCC tumors: few mutations are present in T-Ag+ MCC tumors,
including in tumor suppressors RB1 and TP53, whose activities are instead repressed by the functions of the T-
Ags. Latent MCV infection that doesn’t result in T-Ag production is found in a substantial portion of the human
population, however MCC occurs only rarely. Much of what occurs between latent infection and the appearance
of a full-blown T-Ag+ MCC tumor has not been explored due to the lack of in vivo MCC tumorigenesis models.
Among the unanswered questions is how the MCV T-Ags induce a tumor transcriptional program that features
markers of multiple cell lineages, including both epidermal stem cell and neuroendocrine fates.
Previous research in our laboratory determined that SOX9-expressing (SOX9+) hair follicle cells, which give rise
to mechanosensory Merkel cells during fetal development, are also Merkel cell progenitors in adult skin.
Hypothesizing that T-Ags reprogram cells in the Merkel cell lineage to cause MCC, I generated transgenic mice
that express sT-Ag and ablate RB1 to mimic LT-Ag in SOX9+ cells. These mice developed tumors that were not
bona-fide MCC but expressed neuroendocrine markers, making these mice a valuable model in which to study
mechanisms of T-Ag mediated reprogramming. Analysis of tumors at early time points revealed that re-
programming occurred only in specific sub-populations of SOX9+ cells and that reprogrammed cells were highly
apoptotic. Therefore, I hypothesized that specific landscapes of gene accessibility are required for T-Ags to
induce reprogramming from an origin cell and that suppressing p53 mediated apoptosis is required for MCC.
I propose to leverage the model of SOX9-derived, T-Ag driven neuroendocrine tumors to generate novel insights
into the mechanisms of T-Ag mediated reprogramming. I will use integrated epigenetic and transcriptomic
sequencing analyses to characterize the gene accessibility and transcriptional landscape required for T-Ag
mediated reprogramming to occur and identify a native cell type that is competent to undergo reprogramming.
Furthermore, I will study how p53 suppression, which is commonly observed in MCC tumors, contributes to
advancing reprogramming. Altogether, the proposed studies will establish a model of T-Ag mediated
reprogramming in vivo and discover factors that enable T-Ags to reprogram cells. This research will not only
make valuable contributions to the field of MCC research but also to my training by exposing me to molecular
techniques and genomic and epigenomic analyses that are foundational to an independent research career.

 Filoviruses are prime examples of zoonotic viruses that cause fulminant hemorrhagic diseases in humans
and nonhuman primates (NHP), resulting in death in up to 90% of human case. The filoviridae family contains
six genera in which several species are known to have high fatality rates, all of which are within
the Marburgvirus or Ebolavirus genera and will therefore be the focus of this proposal. The largest ever 2014
Ebola virus (EBOV) disease outbreak in West Africa underscored the development and regulatory approval of
antiviral countermeasures, including an emergency-use vaccine and therapeutic monoclonal antibodies. While
these countermeasures are highly beneficial to block EBOV infection and interfere with disease progression at
early stages, they are less suitable for the treatment of late-stage EBOV disease (EVD), which is less studied.
Late-stage disease is characterized by gastrointestinal manifestations including diarrhea. At present, no
available animal models, including the classical NHP model, can recapitulate the gastrointestinal symptoms of
EVD patients. To elucidate the role of the intestinal epithelium in disease initiation and progression, we propose
to establish an intestinal filovirus infection model using human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC)-derived
human intestinal organoids (HIOs).
 We hypothesize that infection with EBOV and MARV compromises barrier integrity of the intestinal
epithelium and causes abnormal ion flux as the basis for gastrointestinal dysfunction and diarrhea. This
project proposes the establishment of a polarized 2-dimentional HIO transwell system that will be used to study
the pathophysiological effects of filovirus infection on intestinal epithelial integrity. In Aim 1, we will characterize
filovirus-mediated injury by analyzing (1) intestinal barrier and (2) tight junction integrity. We hypothesize that the
sepsis-like syndrome that occurs in some patients with severe disease may be due to loss of epithelial barrier
integrity in the intestine. In Aim 2, we intend to validate the role of individual genes by genetic ablation and test
potential drug candidates as modulators of intestinal epithelial function. We hypothesize that if tight junctions are
compromised in infected HIOs, then treatment with small molecule inhibitors targeted at ion exchanger would
reverse the leaky junctions by blocking the receptor responsible for the disassemble of the junction. The aims
proposed in this study will result in an improved model which more closely recapitulates in vivo intestinal epithelial
phenotypes, and thus can be used to inform novel therapeutics targeted at late-stage filovirus infection.
 The successful, longstanding mentorship of Drs. Mostoslavsky and Mühlberger, the collaborative support of
the CReM, the availability of the NEIDL research facilities and the rigorous MTM training program will provide
me with the tools and support needed to successfully complete my dissertation work. These departments instill
important values about the rigorous approach to academic science by supporting technical training, writing
workshops and seminar and lecture series.

Plasmodium falciparum is a pathogenic eukaryote in the phylum Apicomplexa with a complex life cycle that
alternates between Anopheles mosquitoes and humans. During the blood stages of the P. falciparum life cycle,
a single merozoite invades a human red blood cell (RBC). Over the course of 48 hours, the parasite multiplies
its genetic material and organelles via schizogony to form 20-36 merozoites. During infection, a small subset of
these parasites (~0.2-1.0%) commit and differentiate into transmissible male and female gametocytes via staged
process called gametocytogenesis. These two processes require elaborate, controlled cytoskeletal remodeling
to occur. The Plasmodium cytoskeleton comprises the pellicle, which includes the parasite plasma membrane
and a specialized organelle referred to as the inner membrane complex, and the subpellicular network that
constitutes microtubules and a family of intermediate filament-like proteins called alveolins. These structures
together serve to partition cytoplasmic contents during segmentation, confer cell shape and rigidity for daughter
merozoites and developing gametocytes, and provide essential structure support during gliding motility and RBC
invasion. We have recently discovered a novel Plasmodium cytoskeletal protein, PfFIG (Found In Gametocytes)
during our study the basal complex during blood stage P. falciparum infection. My preliminary data demonstrate
that PfFIG is important for asexual replication and is associated with microtubule dynamics in segmenting
schizonts and maturing gametocytes. We do not know, however, the functional role of PfFIG during the
Plasmodium blood stages of human malaria infection. Using inducible knockout (iKO) systems together with
super-resolution and cell viability assays, I will characterize the role of PfFIG (PF3D7_1435600) in P. falciparum
daughter cell segmentation and gametocyte maturation. This will elucidate its unique role in Plasmodium
microtubule dynamics, specifically as it contributes to cell shape and facilitates life stage transitions. Additionally,
I will perform immunoprecipitation and proximity-labeling experiments to map the PfFIG interactome, identifying
proteins of interest for future study and characterization. This research will broaden our understandings of the
core cellular machinery utilized by Plasmodium to carry out its unique life cycle. Specifically, study of
Plasmodium-specific cytoskeletal proteins and their role across parasite life stages will bring us closer to
targeting these proteins with antimalarial drugs.

Concurrent increase in life expectancy and the prevalence of age-related metabolic diseases
highlights how the biology of aging and metabolic dysfunction are intertwined. Dietary restriction
(DR) promotes healthy aging and disease resistance through the manipulation of canonical
nutrient sensing pathways, like TORC1 (target of rapamycin complex I) signaling. However,
manipulation of such critical metabolic pathways results in pleiotropic effects, making it critical to
understand their distinct downstream mechanisms. Previous studies in C. elegans suggest a
critical role for the spliceosome component REPO-1 (reverse polarity 1) in modulating lipid
accumulation and longevity downstream of DR and TORC1 specifically. Knockdown of REPO-1
causes an increase in lipid accumulation in genetic models of DR and reduced TORC1 signaling.
We have identified specific lipid species such as the C18:1 fatty acid as targets of REPO-1
modulation. Additionally, REPO-1 binds pod-2 (polarity and osmotic sensitivity defect 1) Pre-
mRNA and pod-2 is similarly and specifically required for DR and TORC1 lifespan extension.
Further, knockdown of pod-2 phenotypically mimics knockdown of repo-1 causing increased lipid
accumulation. However, it remains to be determined whether this constitutes a causal pathway.
Therefore, the overarching aim of this proposal is to uncover the contribution of pre-mRNA
splicing and lipid metabolism in TORC1 lifespan extension. My central hypothesis is that
REPO-1 regulates TORC1 lifespan extension by modulating alternative splicing and specific lipid
species through POD-2. In aim 1, we will use Crispr/Cas9 mediated tagging of endogenous
REPO-1 to assess tissue-specific effects of REPO-1 on alternative splicing, modulation of lipid
accumulation and longevity downstream of TORC1 signaling. In aim 2, we will achieve tissue-
specific degradation of POD-2 to determine the tissue where it modulates longevity and fat
reserves in TORC1 signaling. We will also define the changes to the lipidome of TORC1 regulated
by POD-2, compare them to REPO-1 dependent changes, and test their contribution to longevity.
Altogether this work will broaden our mechanistic understanding of RNA homeostasis as a
novel paradigm of aging and physiology and expand our knowledge of target pathways to
promote healthy aging.

Certain viruses in the picornaviridae family, specifically enterovirus-D68 (EV68), have emerged as global health
concerns over the last decade with severe symptomatic infections with EV68 able to result in long lasting
neurological deficits and death. There are currently no US Food and Drug Administration approved drugs for any
non-polio enterovirus, highlighting the need to develop strategies against these lethal enteroviral strains. One
particularly attractive class of potential drugs are small molecules inhibitors, which can act as direct-acting
antiviral (DAA) inhibitors towards the conserved active site of EV68 3C protease. This main viral protease is a
cysteine protease conserved in the 3C family, responsible for cleaving eight sites along the viral polyprotein,
which is essential for viral propagation. DAAs designed to target 3C proteases can potentially achieve robust
inhibition across enterovirus species. However, as drug resistance in viruses can be prevalent, it is paramount
to design inhibitors less susceptible to resistance mutations. It was demonstrated previously in the Schiffer Lab
that when bound to protease, viral substrates occupy a conserved three-dimensional volume called the substrate
envelope. It was also demonstrated that inhibitors that extend beyond the substrate envelope are more
susceptible to drug resistance mutations. By utilizing the substrate envelope and cocrystal structures of the
proteases, DAAs designed to fit within the three-dimensional consensus volume as naturally occurring substrates
will interact primarily with functionally important residues and be less susceptible to drug resistance mutations.
The central hypothesis of this proposal is that cocrystallization of EV68 3C protease with its natural substrates
will enable the calculation of the substrate envelope to inform on substrate specificity, which will also aid in the
design of robust pan-3C-protease inhibitors. In Aim 1, I will determine the cocrystal structures of EV68 3C
protease bound to viral substrates. I will then use these structures to elucidate the molecular mechanism of
substrate specificity for EV68 3C protease and calculate the substrate envelope. These data will aid in small-
molecule design to create DAAs with improved resilience to mutations that can confer drug resistance. In Aim 2,
I will design and test novel DAAs that target EV68 3C protease. I will first characterize previously designed
inhibitors for other 3C and 3C-like proteases with the substrate envelope to establish a starting compound based
on potency. Inhibitors based on the scaffold will be designed, synthesized, and tested in a FRET-based enzyme
inhibition assay. Crystallization of novel potent compounds with EV68 3C and their characterization within the
substrate envelope will assess inhibitors’ susceptibility to drug resistance mutations. Overall, this study aims to
develop a robust, novel compounds with resistance-thwarting protease inhibition against the emerging pathogen
that is EV68.

Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are clonal blood disorders, whose pathogenesis is driven by a class of
oncogenic somatic mutations in RNA splicing factors (in the genes SRSF2, SF3B1, U2AF1, and ZRSR2) in up
to 80% of cases. Efforts to target these mutations in MDS with splicing modulatory drugs have been largely
unsuccessful, and there is a great need for improved therapy. To this end, our group previously demonstrated
that mis-spliced mRNAs induced by splicing modulatory drugs can serve as rich sources of immunogenic
tumor antigens. Based on this proof-of-concept work, we hypothesize that mis-spliced mRNA isoforms induced
by spliceosomal gene mutations can also generate meaningful tumor antigens that can be targeted by cognate
T-cell receptor (TCR) therapeutics. The long-term goal of this project is to develop novel antigen-based TCR
therapeutics for MDS with spliceosomal mutations. Spliceosomal mutations are also prevalent in clonal
hematopoiesis (CH) and associated with an increased risk of progression to MDS and acute myeloid leukemia,
and the project also aspires to develop safe and effective immunization strategies for these genomic subtypes
of CH.
The immediate objectives of the project are to identify mis-splicing-derived tumor antigens induced by
spliceosomal mutations as well as their cognate TCRs. In Aim 1, we will predict such tumor antigens by
analyzing RNA-Seq datasets of myeloid leukemia patient samples and performing immunopeptidomics. We will
then validate candidate peptides in vitro for their HLA binding affinity and ability to elicit CD8+ T cell responses.
In Aim 2, we will identify antigen-specific CD8+ T cells in MDS patient peripheral blood and bone marrow and
extract their TCR sequences using dextramer-based single-cell multiomics. We will validate the potency and
specificity of the identified TCRs both in vitro and in vivo.
Overall, the project will (1) corroborate our previously findings that mis-spliced mRNAs are viable
immunotherapeutic targets and (2) inspire novel immunotherapies such as TCR therapeutics for MDS patients
and vaccines for subjects with CH. Dr. Omar Abdel-Wahab, a clinician-scientist with expertise in spliceosomal
mutations in MDS and passion for mentoring future clinician-scientists, will sponsor the project. Dr. David
Scheinberg, also a clinician-scientist with expertise in TCR therapeutics as well as a track-record of training
multiple MD-PhD students, will co-sponsor the project. The research efforts will take place at the Sloan
Kettering Institute, where its researchers have made tremendous contributions to the understanding and
clinical implementation of immunotherapies into cancer medicine. Direct mentorship from Dr. Abdel-Wahab
and Dr. Scheinberg, combined with the guidance provided by the Tri-Institutional MD-PhD Program, will ensure
the successful completion of the proposed project and prepare the applicant for the future career path as an
independent investigator.

 Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are biologically and environmentally persistent anthropogenic
chemicals. Over 98% of the U.S. population has detectable levels of PFAS in their blood (serum). People may
be exposed to PFAS through contaminated drinking water and food, house dust, or consumer products. Some
populations may experience additional PFAS exposures from their jobs or hobbies. PFAS are of public health
concern because of their associations with numerous adverse health outcomes including dyslipidemia, an
imbalance of blood lipids such as high cholesterol. Dyslipidemia is a primary risk factor for ischemic heart disease
(IHD), the leading cause of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the U.S. and globally.
 Volunteer firefighters are community members who fill a critical public safety function, particularly in suburban
and rural areas. Firefighters can be exposed to PFAS through combustion products, firefighting foams, and
firefighter protective clothing. The association between PFAS exposure and dyslipidemia is of major concern in
this population because cardiac events are the primary cause of line-of-duty deaths among all firefighters.
However, the extent and pathways of volunteer firefighters’ PFAS exposures, and the ways these exposures
may affect their blood lipid levels, are unknown. While 65% of the over 1 million U.S. firefighters are volunteers,
they are understudied, creating critical knowledge gaps in evidence-based efforts to protect and improve the
health of volunteer firefighters and the communities they serve.
 To address these gaps, we will leverage existing data from the Rutgers Firefighter Cancer Assessment and
Prevention Study (CAPS), a cohort of volunteer firefighters from 8 U.S. states. This F31 fellowship builds upon
the applicant’s preliminary work with CAPS data using pilot funding. Two specific aims will be used to achieve
the objectives of identifying (a) predictors of serum PFAS concentrations including sociodemographic,
firefighting, and occupational characteristics, and (b) associations between PFAS and lipid concentrations in
volunteer firefighters. Aim 1: Assess the seroprevalence, predictors, and possible exposure sources of
PFAS among U.S. volunteer firefighters. We hypothesize that heterogeneous distributions and concentrations
of serum PFAS will be associated primarily with community-related exposure sources. Aim 2: Examine
associations between serum PFAS and dyslipidemia among U.S. volunteer firefighters. We hypothesize
that serum PFOA and PFOS (the most frequently detected and studied PFAS) will be positively associated with
total cholesterol and LDL. We will also assess associations between less commonly studied PFAS and seven
lipid measures. We will use single-pollutant and mixture models to characterize the effects of multiple
simultaneous PFAS exposures. This work will advance our understanding of the health impacts of this
environmental exposure in a critical population of community-based first responders.

Over the past several years, we have experienced the social and physical consequences of a viral pandemic;
however, the cellular and molecular mechanisms of repair following such infections are not fully understood. The
lung serves as the site of gas exchange. Due to this function, it is constantly exposed to noxious environmental
stimuli—including bacteria and viruses. Following viral respiratory infection, many of the epithelial cells lining the
airways are lost and must be reconstituted. The epithelial-intrinsic mechanisms underlying such recovery are
well understood, but the role of the immune system in this process is not well defined. In close contact with
epithelial cells in the distal lung are alveolar macrophages, innate immune cells capable of sensing diverse
stimuli and integrating these signals into effector responses. Our previous work has shown that macrophages
engage in reciprocal growth factor exchange with fibroblasts, a communication circuit we predict to be active in
other cell types and contexts. In the lung, macrophages have been observed to help mediate inflammation and
repair via communication with epithelial cells following injury, however, the role of these interactions in the context
of viral infection remains unknown. Using a mouse-adapted influenza A virus, we observe a marked loss of
epithelial cells followed by rapid recovery, all under a constant presence of macrophages. This study aims to
determine the role of macrophages in this repair process. We hypothesize that optimal epithelial repair
requires macrophages at specific time points and anatomical locations following viral-induced damage.
We also propose that bidirectional crosstalk between macrophages and epithelial cells promotes tissue
repair. The proposed work will serve to 1) define when and where macrophages are required for optimal repair
following viral injury and 2) provide mechanistic understanding of macrophage-epithelial communication
networks in the injured and regenerating lung. Completion of this project will allow us to identify molecular targets
whose modulation may improve patient outcomes following viral infection. The Franklin lab is the ideal research
environment to perform these studies. Dr. Franklin (sponsor) is an expert in macrophage biology and has
previously unraveled interactions between macrophages and non-immune cells. Our location at Harvard Medical
School also grants access to world-class experts and resources to complete our aims. For example, Dr. Carla
Kim (co-sponsor) is an expert on lung damage and repair and will provide guidance on lung biology and epithelial
progenitor cell function following damage. Together, my mentoring team and institutional resources will help me
achieve the goals outlined in this proposal and allow me to grow both as a scientist and an individual.

In 2020, U.S. electricity customers faced an average of 8 hours without power, the longest duration on record.
Climate change is expected to cause more severe weather events, which can damage electricity grids and dis-
tribution pathways. Outages may be particularly problematic for cardiovascular health, as they disrupt access to
temperature-controlling tools (e.g., air conditioners, fans). Climate change will also result in higher temperatures,
which can exacerbate cardiovascular disease (CVD). CVD affects 126.9 million American adults and is the lead-
ing cause of death and disability in the U.S., with communities color and socially marginalized communities
disproportionately affected. Understanding the impact of power outages on CVD and how this relationship varies
across community sociodemographic characteristics is central to climate and environmental justice. A critical
research gap remains about the health effects of power outages generally and the extent to which they affect
acute CVD risk. Partly due to the lack of high spatiotemporal resolution measures for outage exposure, most
prior studies have not measured neighborhood-level electricity availability. Additionally, previous studies did not
consider the potential dual threat when outages co-occur with anomalous temperatures or whether certain com-
munities may be particularly vulnerable to the effect of power outages. In particular, we will consider whether
individuals living in communities with higher social vulnerability or more racial/economic segregation experience
worse CVD outcomes after power outages. We will use 2017-2020 New York Statewide Planning and Research
Co-operative System (SPARCS) hospitalization data and 30-minute resolution power outage data within 1,831
power operating units statewide to fill this gap. Using diagnostic codes, we will identify hourly hospitalizations for
the acute cardiovascular outcomes, myocardial infarction and stroke. We plan to implement case-crossover
study designs with conditional logistic models, which inherently control for non-time-varying individual-level con-
founding variables. Our overarching hypothesis is that more outage hours are associated with increased risk of
CVD hospitalizations, particularly during anomalous temperature events, and that there will be disparities in this
exposure-response relationship across area-level vulnerability and segregation. We aim to (1) investigate the
association between power outages and CVD hospitalizations, (2) determine the impacts of exposure to power
outages during anomalously hot and anomalously cold temperature events separately on CVD hospitalizations,
and (3) identify communities vulnerable to the effects of outages on CVD. This research supports the NIEHS
Strategic Plan to evaluate co-exposures and considers issues of environmental justice. Collectively, we will pro-
vide crucial information that can inform future climate adaptation policies to reduce CVD-related morbidity in an
equitable manner.

{'abstract_text': 'SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\nIn 2020, U.S. electricity customers faced an average of 8 hours without power, the longest duration on record.\nClimate change is expected to cause more severe weather events, which can damage electricity grids and dis-\ntribution pathways. Outages may be particularly problematic for cardiovascular health, as they disrupt access to\ntemperature-controlling tools (e.g., air conditioners, fans). Climate change will also result in higher temperatures,\nwhich can exacerbate cardiovascular disease (CVD). CVD affects 126.9 million American adults and is the lead-\ning cause of death and disability in the U.S., with communities color and socially marginalized communities\ndisproportionately affected. Understanding the impact of power outages on CVD and how this relationship varies\nacross community sociodemographic characteristics is central to climate and environmental justice. A critical\nresearch gap remains about the health 
effects of power outages generally and the extent to which they affect\nacute CVD risk. Partly due to the lack of high spatiotemporal resolution measures for outage exposure, most\nprior studies have not measured neighborhood-level electricity availability. Additionally, previous studies did not\nconsider the potential dual threat when outages co-occur with anomalous temperatures or whether certain com-\nmunities may be particularly vulnerable to the effect of power outages. In particular, we will consider whether\nindividuals living in communities with higher social vulnerability or more racial/economic segregation experience\nworse CVD outcomes after power outages. We will use 2017-2020 New York Statewide Planning and Research\nCo-operative System (SPARCS) hospitalization data and 30-minute resolution power outage data within 1,831\npower operating units statewide to fill this gap. Using diagnostic codes, we will identify hourly hospitalizations for\nthe acute cardiovascular outcomes, myocardial infarction and stroke. We plan to implement case-crossover\nstudy designs with conditional logistic models, which inherently control for non-time-varying individual-level con-\nfounding variables. Our overarching hypothesis is that more outage hours are associated with increased risk of\nCVD hospitalizations, particularly during anomalous temperature events, and that there will be disparities in this\nexposure-response relationship across area-level vulnerability and segregation. We aim to (1) investigate the\nassociation between power outages and CVD hospitalizations, (2) determine the impacts of exposure to power\noutages during anomalously hot and anomalously cold temperature 
events separately on CVD hospitalizations,\nand (3) identify communities vulnerable to the effects of outages on CVD. This research supports the NIEHS\nStrategic Plan to evaluate co-exposures and considers issues of environmental justice. Collectively, we will pro-\nvide crucial information that can inform future climate adaptation policies to reduce CVD-related morbidity in an\nequitable manner.', 'link': 'https://reporter.nih.gov/services/Projects/ProjectInfo?projectId=10825178', 'orgin_link': 'https://reporter.nih.gov/project-details/10825178'}

Project Summary / Abstract
Heterochromatin plays a crucial role in the repression of transposons, genome stability, and cell differentiation
through its ability to silence DNA transcription. How heterochromatin represses transcription by RNA polymerase
II (Pol II) is an open question. In Schizosaccharomyces pombe, histone three lysine 9 di- and tri-methyl (H3K9me)
bearing heterochromatic loci accomplish transcriptional silencing by recruiting the Heterochromatin Protein 1
(HP1) homologs Swi6 and Chp2. Together, HP1swi6/chp2 proteins induce chromatin compaction, recruit
downstream factors such as histone deacetylases (HDAC) and chromatin remodelers, and promote nascent
RNA decay. Previous studies have unraveled the mechanisms responsible for processing and degrading
nascent RNA transcripts. However, the mechanism(s) by which heterochromatin inhibits Pol II activity, referred
to as transcriptional gene silencing (TGS), is not fully understood. In the proposed work, I explore the following
questions: Which HP1swi6/chp2 functions are sufficient for TGS and what is the mechanism of HP1swi6/chp2 mediated
TGS? I hypothesize that HP1swi6/chp2 mediates TGS through distinct activities: intrinsic nonspecific DNA binding,
liquid-liquid phase separation formation, and the downstream recruitment of histone deacetylase and remodeling
activities. To test this hypothesis, I will 1) identify which Swi6 functions are necessary for heterochromatic TGS
using HP1swi6/chp2 mutant strains, 2) identify activities downstream of HP1swi6/chp2 that are sufficient for
heterochromatic TGS by direct recruitment of proteins to H3K9me loci in cells lacking recruitment of downstream
factors, and 3) Identify the specific transcriptional stage inhibited by HP1swi6/chp2 by characterizing the proteome
of heterochromatic and euchromatic ectopic locus. Achieving these aims would contribute to understanding the
mechanisms of gene regulation and transposon repression. In addition, mechanistic knowledge of
heterochromatic TGS could help treat diseases associated with heterochromatin defects.

第三步：提取的 abstract_text 数据是：Abstract: Transcription is one of the first steps in gene expression, and the many protein factors involved must
be tightly regulated to correctly carry out cellular processes. The Integrator complex, a 15-subunit metazoan-
specific complex, was initially discovered to be crucial for the proper transcription of certain non-coding RNAs.
Recently, it has been found that Integrator is a broad transcriptional regulator with roles at many protein-coding
and non-coding genes. Integrator acts as a negative regulator of RNA Polymerase II (RNAPII) transcription
through promoter-proximal termination and can alter its functionality in response to stress, such as DNA damage
or reactive oxygen species. Despite its critical role in fine-tuning transcriptional regulation, it is not yet understood
how Integrator is assembled and regulated, presenting a knowledge gap in the field.
 Our preliminary experiments strikingly revealed that a key factor involved in DNA damage repair (DDR)
associates with a global regulator of RNAPII activity, thus providing a previously unknown connection between
these two processes. Specifically, the BRCA1-ATM activator 1 (BRAT1) associates with Integrator subunit 11
(INTS11), the endonuclease-containing subunit within the Integrator complex. BRAT1 is a cytoplasmic protein
that re-localizes to the nucleus upon DNA damage to act as a scaffold between the site of damage and repair
proteins. Our cryo-EM analysis of the INTS11-BRAT1 heterodimer reveals that BRAT1 forms a circular structure
around INTS11 and uses three conserved C-terminal residues to bind to the INTS11 active site, preventing its
cleavage of RNA. Additionally, the cryo-EM analysis showed that INTS9 can bind to form an INTS11-INTS9-
BRAT1 heterotrimer, suggesting interplay between BRAT1 as an inhibitor of INTS11 and other members of the
Integrator complex. The goal of this proposal is to examine the function and mechanism of action of these two
unique complexes. To examine the function, our lab generated BRAT1 null cell lines and a rapid depletion system
using the auxin-inducible degron (AID) tag to allow quick depletion of INTS11. Initial studies of these lines show
that BRAT1 loss results in an INTS11 depletion phenotype, presenting upregulation of genes negatively
regulated by Integrator. Overall, these data present a model where BRAT1 could regulate Integrator activity
through its association with INTS9/11. The hypothesis is that BRAT1 acts as a licensing factor, facilitating the
assembly of the Integrator complex and providing precise regulation, which is especially important during cellular
stress such as DNA damage. To test this hypothesis, three aims are proposed. First, the interaction between
BRAT1 and INTS9/11 will be biochemically defined to further probe the structure. Next, the impact of BRAT1 on
the canonical Integrator complex function will be determined. Finally, the impact of INTS11-INTS9-BRAT1 during
DNA damage repair will be elucidated. Successful completion of these aims will provide a more thorough
understanding of the regulation and assembly of the Integrator complex.

Vectors derived from adeno-associated virus (AAV) have been clinically validated for gene therapy to treat ocular
diseases. This was showcased in 2017 by the FDA approval of Luxturna, an AAV2-based gene therapy to treat
an inherited form of blindness. Luxturna made history by becoming the first FDA-approved therapy to treat a
genetic disease. Despite its clinical success, intraocular inflammation and toxicity has been reported for Luxturna
and other AAV-based therapies for retinal disease. Gene expression data from the literature has demonstrated
that double-stranded (dsRNA)-responsive pathways, such as the RIG-I and MDA5 signaling pathways, are
upregulated upon subretinal and systemic administration of AAV gene therapy vectors in mice and non-human
primates. AAV vectors have also been previously documented to exhibit intrinsic promoter activity within the
inverted terminal repeats (ITRs), which can produce sense and antisense transcripts in transduced cells.
Unpublished data from our lab has shown a slight (but not statistically significant) alleviation of toxicity upon
subretinal injection of a toxic AAV into mice lacking functional MAVS (a dsRNA signaling adaptor) relative to
wild-type controls. Taken together, these data suggest that there may be a role for dsRNA sensing pathways in
mediating AAV ocular toxicity, which we hope to test directly using the experiments in Aim 1. We hypothesize
that ITR-directed sense and antisense transcripts in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) hybridize to
produce dsRNA, which activates cellular dsRNA sensors like RIG-I, MDA5, or others leading to ocular
toxicity. Because MAVS KO data did not produce full rescue of cone toxicity, nor did any other single innate or
adaptive KO strain tested, we hypothesize there are multiple pathways, immune or non-immune related,
contributing to toxicity. We will therefore perform an unbiased search for other pathways that could be
mediating toxicity in Aim 2 using a spatial transcriptomics approach developed in our lab, Light-Seq. Light-Seq
enables us to read out gene expression in user-defined regions of the same sample (e.g., AAV-transduced vs.
untransduced regions) without requiring cellular dissociation. I will use immunofluorescence (IF) and RNA
fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH, e.g., SABER-FISH or HCR-FISH) coupled with confocal imaging
throughout my proposal to confirm AAV tissue transduction, validate pathway hits, and quantify ocular toxicity.
Additionally, I will use genetic and pharmacologic perturbations to validate pathway candidates. Completion of
this proposal will expand our knowledge of antiviral responses to AAV vectors in the eye and may help guide
development of safer, more effective AAV ocular therapeutics. Additionally, insights gained in this proposal may
inform the development of safer AAV vectors delivered to other organs of therapeutic relevance.

 Calcium (Ca2+) is a critical regulator of neurotransmission in both axons and dendrites of neurons. Ca2+
fluctuations during neuronal activation are usually attributed to influx through voltage gated Ca2+ channels, but
in vitro evidence suggests that intracellular Ca2+ handling, particularly by the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), could
shape cytosolic Ca2+ signals and therefore neurotransmission. Our preliminary data indicate that the ER in
neurons of the Drosophila visual system displays Ca2+ fluctuations in response to visual stimulus in vivo. Given
that altered ER Ca2+ signaling has been implicated in neurodegeneration and retinal degeneration, the objective
of this work is to determine the role of ER Ca2+ signaling in Drosophila visual system neurons and determine the
molecular basis of compartment specific ER Ca2+ signals in motion vision circuits. The first aim is to determine
the underlying mechanisms governing compartment specific ER Ca2+ signals using in vivo 2-photon microscopy.
Findings from this aim will help elucidate the functional roles of ER Ca2+ signals in axons and dendrites. The
second aim is to determine the role of ER Ca2+ handling neurotransmission and in motion vision circuit function,
leveraging genetic perturbations in well-defined circuits. These studies will determine if ER Ca2+ signaling shapes
cytosolic Ca2+ fluctuations, linking it to circuit function and neurotransmission in the visual system. The fellowship
training plan includes in vivo 2-photon imaging, Drosophila genetics, programming, and career guidance.
Through training opportunities during this project, I will develop the skills to complete this work, and continue in
a career in academic research.

Influenza remains a global health challenge. There is a pressing need for next-generation vaccines that can
protect against a broad range of influenza subtypes, particularly those of pandemic potential (e.g., H5, H7).
Hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) are two surface glycoproteins, which facilitate virion binding and
egress, respectively. While contemporary influenza vaccines are not standardized for NA, recent studies have
underscored the importance of NA-directed antibodies in influenza protection. However, relative to HA, the
immunodominance of NA and its evolutionary response to immune pressure remain largely uncharacterized.
Furthermore, whether an NA-based immunogen(s) can focus the humoral response to conserved sites on NA
has yet to be determined. The NA catalytic site (CS) cleaves sialic acid to enable viral egress and is conserved
amongst NA subtypes. Here, I hypothesize that structure-guided immunogen design can focus the immune
response to the conserved NA CS and augment anti-NA antibody breadth. To elicit a focused, CS-directed
immune response, I will pursue two approaches. 1) l will engineer glycans on the NA periphery to mask variable
epitopes, leaving the conserved CS exposed. 2) I will graft the conformationally complex CS onto antigenically
distinct scaffolds to enrich the CS epitope relative to other epitopes. To elicit broader anti-NA immunity and
augment CS-directed B cell activation, I will increase NA valency using protein linkers and nanoparticle platforms.
I will then test the effects of these NA immunogens in vivo and characterize the resulting serum, germinal center,
and memory B cell repertoires. I further hypothesize that focused anti-NA immunity will complement focused
anti-HA immunity to restrict influenza escape pathways. After passaging an influenza strain with anti-HA
antibodies, anti-NA antibodies, or both, I will characterize viral escape mutants and compare growth kinetics
relative to the wildtype strain. The data generated from this proposal will elucidate the effectiveness of the
proposed immune-focusing strategies as a general approach to vaccine design and particularly inform the
optimization of NA immunogens for next-generation influenza vaccines. These results will also advance our
understanding of NA antigenicity and evolvability.

Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB), remains the leading cause of death
amongst infectious causes. While we have made progress reducing TB mortality, disease burden has stagnated
due to our inability to reduce the incidence rate of TB. This can be attributed to our lack of transmission blocking
interventions and the highly infectious nature of Mtb’ s aerosol transmission. Aerosolization represents an
essential physiologic process for Mtb’ s transmission and infectious life cycle that can be targeted to reduce TB
transmission and incidence. Mtb has likely evolved an adaptive response to the dramatic microenvironment
changes it experiences as it transitions from the nutrient-rich lung to the desolate atmosphere. The specific
genes and metabolic pathways that Mtb employs to navigate these changes are poorly understood. In the aerosol
droplet environment, Mtb is deprived of CO2 and nitrogen sources which provide the carbon and nitrogen building
blocks on which Mtb relies for biosynthetic processes. My project seeks to understand metabolic mechanisms
underlying Mtb’ s response to CO2 and nitrogen deprivation. Preliminary data from our lab has identified arginine
biosynthesis as a key metabolic pathway mediating Mtb’ s response to CO2 limitation. I propose that arginine
biosynthesis mediates Mtb survival in the CO2 and nitrogen limited aerosol droplet environment, by maintaining
a steady flux of carbamoyl phosphate, thermodynamically activated and short-lived essential intermediate. In
this model, I propose that arginine biosynthesis is configured as a cycle mediated by ArcA or Rv2323c, a currently
uncharacterized protein which I hypothesize to act as an arginine dihydrolase. Through this configuration,
arginine biosynthesis couples NH4+ regeneration in ArcA or Rv2323c catalysis with the oxidative production of
CO2 in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. I hypothesize that Mtb can regulate between Rv2323c and ArcA based
on nutrient availability. I predict that Mtb preferentially uses ArcA during CO2 and nitrogen limitation, since ArcA
can mediate an arginine cycle without consuming CO2 and NH4+ equivalents. I will test this hypothesis with three
Aims. In Aim 1, I will identify the biochemical role of Rv2323c in arginine metabolism through in vitro and in vivo
characterization of Rv2323c’s catalytic activity and physiologic function. In Aim 2, I will characterize the roles of
ArcA and Rv2323c in CO2 limited environments and measure their contributions to the endogenous pool of CO2
and impact on Mtb survival in air. In Aim 3, I will characterize the role of ArcA and Rv2323c in nitrogen limited
environments by determining Mtb’ s preference for either enzyme in these conditions and their impact on Mtb’ s
survival. These approaches will reveal novel insights into Mtb’ s adaptive response to aerosolization with the
potential of identifying therapeutic targets to block Mtb transmission.

{'abstract_text': 'PROJECT SUMMARY\nMycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB), remains the leading cause of death\namongst infectious causes. While we have made progress reducing TB mortality, disease burden has stagnated\ndue to our inability to reduce the incidence rate of TB. This can be attributed to our lack of transmission blocking\ninterventions and the highly infectious nature of Mtb’ s aerosol transmission. Aerosolization represents an\nessential physiologic process for Mtb’ s transmission and infectious life cycle that can be targeted to reduce TB\ntransmission and incidence. Mtb has likely evolved an adaptive response to the dramatic microenvironment\nchanges it experiences as it transitions from the nutrient-rich lung to the desolate atmosphere. The specific\ngenes and metabolic pathways that Mtb employs to navigate these changes are poorly understood. In the aerosol\ndroplet environment, Mtb is deprived of CO2 and nitrogen sources which provide the carbon and nitrogen building\nblocks on which Mtb relies for biosynthetic processes. My project seeks to understand metabolic mechanisms\nunderlying Mtb’ s response to CO2 and nitrogen deprivation. Preliminary data from our lab has identified arginine\nbiosynthesis as a key metabolic pathway mediating Mtb’ s response to CO2 limitation. I propose that arginine\nbiosynthesis mediates Mtb survival in the CO2 and nitrogen limited aerosol droplet environment, by maintaining\na steady flux of carbamoyl phosphate, thermodynamically activated and short-lived essential intermediate. In\nthis model, I propose that arginine biosynthesis is configured as a cycle mediated by ArcA or Rv2323c, a currently\nuncharacterized protein which I hypothesize to act as an arginine dihydrolase. Through this configuration,\narginine biosynthesis couples NH4+ regeneration in ArcA or Rv2323c catalysis with the oxidative production of\nCO2 in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. I hypothesize that Mtb can regulate between Rv2323c and ArcA based\non nutrient availability. I predict that Mtb preferentially uses ArcA during CO2 and nitrogen limitation, since ArcA\ncan mediate an arginine cycle without consuming CO2 and NH4+ equivalents.
